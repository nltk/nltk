Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
    nltk is a Python package that simplifies the construction of
    programs that process natural language; and defines standard
    interfaces between the different components of an NLP system.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Documentation is split into four sets:

        - Tutorial documentation: describes how to use the toolkit.
        - Technical reports: describe how the toolkit works, and
          provides the rational behind its design.
        - Reference documentation: provides precise descriptions of
          each Python module, class, and function defined by the
          toolkit. 
        - Miscellaneous documentation: is a place to store working
          documentation (e.g., descriptions of current issues with the 
          toolkit, and intended future additions).

    Tutorial Documentation
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Each tutorial document is given a short descriptive name
        (typically 5-15 characters, consisting of lower case
        letters).  A tutorial document whose name is <name> is stored
        in doc/tutorial/<name>, and contains at least the following
        files: 

            - <name>.xml .... The tutorial document, written using the 
                              Docbook DTD.
            - <name>.info ... A file used to store meta-information
                              about the tutorial documents.  It
                              consists of keys/value pairs, separated
                              by ":"s.  Values may span multiple
                              lines.  Currently recognized keys are:
                              name, abstract, status, deadline.  This
                              file is used to construct the tutorial
                              documentation webpage.

    Technical Reports
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Each technical report is given a short descriptive name
        (typically 5-15 characters, consisting of lower case
        letters).  A technical report whose name is <name> is stored
        in doc/technical/<name>, and contains at least the following
        files: 

            - <name>.tex .... The techical report, written using 
                              LaTeX.
            - <name>.info ... A file used to store meta-information
                              about the technical reports.  It
                              consists of keys/value pairs, separated
                              by ":"s.  Values may span multiple
                              lines.  Currently recognized keys are:
                              name, abstract, status, deadline.  This
                              file is used to construct the technical
                              reports webpage.

    Reference Documentation
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        The reference documentation is generated automatically from
        the Python source code; it is not included in the CVS
        repository.

    Miscellaneous Documentation
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        The miscellaneous documentation is maintained in a single
        directory (doc/misc).  It consists primarily of plaintext and
        LaTeX files.


Makefiles
~~~~~~~~~
    The main Makefile can be used to perform the following tasks:

        make documentation: Convert all documentation and problem sets
            to output formats (ps and pdf for technical documentation
            and problem sets; html for tutorial documentation).
        make test: Run unit testing on the toolkit.
        make distributions: Construct distribution files for the
            toolkit. 
        make clean: Remove all temporary files and output files
            generated by make.

    In addition, the Makefiles in the doc, psets, and src directories
    can be used to perform other tasks.


Problem Sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~
    The structure of the problem set directory has not yet been
    decided.  The two options under consideration are:

        - Store each problem set or exercise set in its own directory, 
          along with the corresponding solutions.
        - Store all problem sets, sample exercises, and solutions in a 
          single directory.

    The naming conventions for problem sets have also not yet been
    decided. 

Releases
~~~~~~~~

    Releases are available on SourceForge; and are tagged in the
    repository (starting with release 0.4) with tags of the form
    "release-<m>-<n>", where <m> is the major number, and <n> is the
    minor number (e.g., for release 2.18, <m>=2; and <n>=18).

    The procedure for making a new release is:

        1. Update the version number in src/nltk/__init__.py (in 2
           places: the docstring comment; and the __version__
           variable).
        2. Make sure all changes are committed.
        3. Generate a CVS log of all the changes since the previous
           release (note quote marks):

               cvs log "-rrelease-<m>-<n-1>:" >changes.cvslog

        4. Examine the cvs log, and use it to add a new section to 
           src/CHANGES.TXT; commit the changes to src/CHANGES.TXT
        5. Tag the new release:

               cvs tag "release-<m>-<n>"

        6. Run "make distributions"
        7. FTP src/dist/nltk-<m>.<n>* to the "incoming" directory of
           "upload.sf.net"
        8. Make documentation tarball & FTP it to the "incoming" 
           directory of "upload.sf.net"
        9. Add the new release to sourceforge, using the release admin
           page.
