summer.py is basically the wordCountReducerAdv.py, which I think can serve as a general summer
wordCountReducerAdv and wordCountMapperAdv are two somewhat advanced version of wordCount program
wordTagCountMapper count the word/tag pair and word occurences
test.sh can test the wordTagCountMapper program

wordCountMapper subclasses Mapper
wordCountReducer subclasses Reducer
these are the prototype of the class hierarchy
