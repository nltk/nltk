<h2>NLTK Wordnet Browser Help</h2>
<h3>The User Interface</h3>
The user interface is a so called <b>notebook</b> interface. This
is familiar nowadays for almost everyone from Internet browsers,
for example. It consists of one or more independent pages often
(and here also) called <b>tabsheets</b>.
<p>Every tabsheet contains its own search history which can be
browsed back and forth at will. The result of a new word search
will be shown on the currently active tabsheet if nothing else is
wanted. It is also possible to open a new tabsheet for the search
word given.</p>
<p>The result of a search is a display of one or more
<b>synsets</b> of every part of speech in which a form of the
search word was found to belong to. A synset is a set of words
having the same sense or meaning. Each word in a synset that is
underlined is a hypertext link which can be clicked to trigger an
automatic search for that word.</p>
<p>Every synset has a hypertext link <b>S:</b> at the start of its
display line. Clicking that symbol shows you the names of the
relations that this synset is part of. Clicking the relation name
opens up a display for that relation. Clicking it another time
closes the display again. Clicking another relation name on a line
that has an opened relation closes the open relation and opens the
clicked relation.</p>
<p>The position and size of the browser window can be adjusted and
the selections are retained between sessions.</p>
<h3>Menu Structure</h3>
The browser has a menubar that you can use to invoke a set of
different operations. Most of the menu selections also have a
corresponding keyboard shortcut.
<h4>The File Menu</h4>
<p>Using the file menu you can <b>open</b> a previously saved NLTK
Wordnet Browser page. Note that only pages saved with this browser
can be read.</p>
<p>And as indicated above you can <b>save</b> a search page. The
resulting file is a normal HTML mode file which can be viewed,
printed etc. as any other HTML file.</p>
<p>You can also <b>print</b> a page and <b>preview</b> a page to be
printed. The selected printing settings are remembered during the
session.</p>
<h4>The Tabsheets Menu</h4>
<p>You can <b>open an empty tabsheet</b> and <b>close</b> the
currently active tabsheet.</p>
<p>When you enter a new search word in the search word field you
can make the search result be shown in a <b>new tabsheet</b>.</p>
<h4>Page History</h4>
You can browse the page history of the currently active tabsheet
either <b>forwards</b> or <b>backwards</b>. <b>Next Page</b>
browses towards the newer pages and <b>Previous Page</b> towards
the older pages.
<h4>The View Menu</h4>
<p>You can <b>increase</b>, <b>decrease</b> and <b>normalize</b>
the font size. The font size chosen is retained between
sessions.</p>
<p>You can view the <b>HTML source</b> of a page if you are
curious.</p>
<h4>The Help Menu</h4>
You can view this <b>help text</b> as you already know. The
<b>about</b> selection tells you something about the program.
<h4>The Keyboard Shortcuts</h4>
<p>The following keyboard shortcuts can be used to quickly launch
the desired operation.</p>

<dt>(1)</dt>
<dd>This works only when the search word field is active i.e. the
caret is in it.</dd>
<dt>(2)</dt>
<dd>These are nonstandard combinations, the usual ones being
Alt+LeftArrow and Alt+RightArrow. The choice was made because using
Alt caused unwanted random character inserts into the search word
field. The normal combinations will be added if this interference
can be tamed.</dd>
<dt>(3)</dt>
<dd>There are so many of these combinations because the usual i.e.
Ctrl++/Ctrl+- combinations did not work on the author's laptop and
the Numpad combinations were cumbersome to use. Hopefully the first
ones work on the computers of others.</dd>
<dt>(4)</dt>
<dd>This combination Ctrl+0 is "Ctrl+zero" not "Ctrl+ou".</dd>
