      `STOP`
        stops traversal for all nodes under the currently visited one
      `CONTINUE(n)`
       continues the traversal, uses `n` to get the child nodes. Usually, this will
       be the visitied node
      `REPLACE(n)`
       continues the traversal using `n`, but also replaces the visited node by `n`.
    
       
    The traversal will never visit the root node via a method annotated with `@node_handler`. The 
    root node of the tree cannot be replaced [#]_, and only the methods `setup` and `result` have 
    access to it.
