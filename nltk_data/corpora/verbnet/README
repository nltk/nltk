VERBNET LEXICON, VERSION 2.1

VerbNet (VN) (Kipper-Schuler 2006) is the largest on-line verb lexicon
currently available for English. It is a hierarchical
domain-independent, broad-coverage verb lexicon with mappings to other
lexical resources such as WordNet (Miller, 1990; Fellbaum, 1998), Xtag
(XTAG Research Group, 2001), and FrameNet (Baker et al.,
1998). VerbNet is organized into verb classes extending Levin (1993)
classes through refinement and addition of subclasses to achieve
syntactic and semantic coherence among members of a class. Each verb
class in VN is completely described by thematic roles, selectional
restrictions on the arguments, and frames consisting of a syntactic
description and semantic predicates with a temporal function, in a
manner similar to the event decomposition of Moens and Steedman
(1988).
