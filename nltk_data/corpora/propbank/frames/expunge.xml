    Partly because of the show, Mr. Watson says, the district decided
    not to recommend Mrs. Yeargin for a first-time offenders program
    that *trace* could have expunged the charges and the conviction
    from her record.

I also know of a usage which uses just the agent and &quot;source&quot;, as in
&quot;John expunged his criminal record (of false charges)&quot;, which is
similar to 'empty' (which actually hasn't been framed yet).
