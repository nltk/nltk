<note>
Note that &quot;nosedived&quot; is a confirmation of the lexicalist hypothesis
and Blocking--most people would say the past tense of &quot;dived&quot; is
&quot;dove&quot;, but &quot;nosedive&quot; is apparently no longer associated with
&quot;dive&quot; and thus does not take the irregular past tense.  Cool.
