<text>
    Dan E. Nelms, Valley Federal's president and chief executive
    officer, said the one-time charge substantially eliminates future
    losses associated *trace* with the unit . 
</text>
        <rel>associated</rel>
        <arg n="1">*trace* -&gt;  future losses</arg>
        <arg f="with" n="2">the unit</arg>
</example>

<note>
The trace is rarely included in the automatic tagging (but should
always be); occasionally treebank fails to put the tag in at all.
