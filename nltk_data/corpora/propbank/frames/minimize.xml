<example name="typical usage">
<text>
    The action followed by one day an Intelogic announcement that it
    will retain an investment banker *trace* to explore alternatives
    ``*trace* to minimize shareholder value,'' including the possible
    sale of the company. 
</text>
        <arg n="0">*trace* -&gt; *trace* -&gt;  alternatives</arg>
        <rel>minimize</rel>
        <arg n="1">shareholder value</arg>
</example>

<note>
Agency has nothing to do with animacy, but tracing can get funky
sometimes.  When the target of a trace is unclear, go with an animate
agent.
