<example name="abstract event">
  <text>
  James L. Pate was named a director of this oil concern, *trace*
  expanding the board to 14 members.
  </text>
  <arg n="0">*trace*</arg>
  <rel>expanding</rel>
  <arg n="1">the board</arg>
  <arg f="to" n="4">14 members</arg>
</example>

<note>
The trace looks back to the entire event of naming James Pate to the
board, but there is no syntactic node which holds this in exclusion to
the expand predicate.  Nor would it be correct to link the trace to
James Pate, because he is not expanding the board--whoever named him --&gt;
--to the board is the one causing the expansion.  Thus a naked trace.
