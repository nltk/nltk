    As their name implies, these operations are linked to far-reaching
    policy reforms that aim at helping borrowing countries get back on
    the growth path and at enhancing their credit-worthiness.

        <arg n="0">their name</arg>
        <rel>implies</rel>
        <arg n="1">[ these operations] [ are linked  to far-reaching

<note>
Effectively this should be read as &quot;their name implies that these
operations...&quot;, but Treebank uniformly does not parse it this way,
probably because of the &quot;as&quot;.  Hence the need for the non-constituent
argument.
