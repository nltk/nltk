<note>
Sometimes one logical argument is split across a zillion nodes:

Manufacturers' backlogs rose 0.5% in September to $4.36 billion, *trace*
 helped *trace* by defense spending.

Logically, the Arg1 of help is &quot;Manufacturers' backlogs rose 0.5% in
September to $4.36 billion&quot;, but that material is spread across at least
three nodes.  The lower trace of 'help' is linked to &quot;Manufacturers'
backlogs&quot;, which is close enough to the truth for us to accept.
