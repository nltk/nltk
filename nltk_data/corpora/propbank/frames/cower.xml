     Thus, you do the public a great disservice when Mr. Greve
     suggests, even facetiously, that the Clean Water Act prohibits
     the preparation of a scotch and water; your tippling readers may
     be led to believe that nothing but chance or oversight protects
     them, as they cower in the night with their scotch and waters,
     from the hairyknuckled knock of the Sierra Club at their doors.

'Cower in fear' is such a fixed phrase the the 'in fear' could almost
be considered argument-y.
