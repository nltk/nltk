    Mr. Alito said his office ``just responded to an attorney's
    question about whether we would go after attorney's fees, and that
    is different from actually doing it, although we reserve that
    right.''

    Gemina said in a statement that ``it reserves the right to take
    any action to protect its rights as a member of the syndicate.''

        <arg n="0">it</arg>
        <rel>reserves</rel>

</example>

<note>
I read the ArgM as modifying either &quot;its rights&quot; or the arg0 &quot;it&quot;.
Either way, it's not attached to the reserving.

<note>
Not sure about that, after all.  Hopefully a better example will come
up.
