Beware of usages like &quot;put the taggers to work&quot;.  Treebank calls work
a verb in this context, but that is clearly wrong.  It will take no
argument structure.

    It may seem trivial to worry about the World Series amid the

but this usage is clearly using it as the passive of wreak; the
'proper' passive of wreak is wreaked.  Now I wonder where else wrought
is showing up.
