    ``Thank God we have some deal on the table,'' said Stewart

    which intends to vote its roughly 1% stake in favor of the
    restructuring.

<note>
Two points about the last example: Scottish Amicable is not doing the
voting, really, but rather the shares (cf the previous example).  Thus
Scottish Amicable takes the causal agent role.  Also, &quot;in favor
of&quot; is basically the same as &quot;for&quot;.
