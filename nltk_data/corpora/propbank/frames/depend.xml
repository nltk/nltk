<note>
  Frames file for 'depend' based on survey of sentences from financial
  subcorpus.  Verbnet class exist-47.1, other members 'exist' 'live'
  'remain' and 'wait' have been framed, but that's not the main sense
  of depend, to my mind.

    *trace* Depending upon how many warrants and options are exercised prior

<note>
The thing depending (arg0) technically refers to the rest of the
sentence (the event of Heritage issuing shares), but the syntax
doesn't allow for that to be the target of the trace, so let it go.
