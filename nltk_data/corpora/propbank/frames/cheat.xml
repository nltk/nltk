    But the ``real world'' also includes the unpleasant truth that
    colleges are cheating the athletes they have wooed and won.

<note>
Argument order suggested by comparison with remove (class 10.7).  Be
very careful with distinguishing this sense from the following in
transitive sentences.  To distinguish the senses, try adding an &quot;of&quot; or
&quot;out of&quot; phrase to the sentence; only this sense can take that
additional argument.  For example, the second example above can be
modified to &quot;Colleges are cheating the athletes out of a decent
education.&quot;
