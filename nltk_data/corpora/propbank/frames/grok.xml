<note>
This word was invented by Robert Heinlein in 'Stranger in a Strange
Land' to denote an experience alien to the human condition. As such,
it is largely undefined--indeed, most of the story is devoted to a
human learning what 'grokking' is all about.  In later usage, 'grok'
has been shifted to mean 'to understand (fully)' which, while taking
the same argument structure (except not the intransitive), loses much
of the magic of the original.
