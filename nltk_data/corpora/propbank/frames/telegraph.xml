<note>
This actually conflates two very distinct senses.  One is the obvious
&quot;send a message via telegraph&quot;.  The other is &quot;say very succinctly&quot;.
Unfortunately, &quot;send&quot; and &quot;say&quot; take exactly opposite framing WRT
where the &quot;receiver&quot;/&quot;hearer&quot; argument goes, numerically.  But rather
than have two rolesets, identical except for this, for a low-frequency
verb, we'll conflate them and see if anyone complains.
