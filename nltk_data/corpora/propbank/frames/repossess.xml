<text>
    After Laurel Bank tried *trace* to repossess the car, a vice
    president asked him to intervene in an unrelated legal dispute
    involving a trust account.

<note>
Could be a 'source' argument (&quot;The bank repossessed the car from
John&quot;) but it sounds a little awkward and the corpus doesn't have
enough examples.
