  <note>
  DO NOT TAG--compare is being used as a preposition (or even a conjunction!)
  here.  Only tag if there is a trace in the tree, as in the following
  two examples.  You can tell it's not a verb because you can't add an adverb:
  &quot;Apples compare well with oranges&quot; but &quot;*Apples are cheap, compared well
  to oranges.&quot;
