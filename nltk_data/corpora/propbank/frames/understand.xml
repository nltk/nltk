The syntax will determine the difference between the first and second
examples; by all rights &quot;John to be an idiot&quot; should be a single
constituent which could be called Arg1 all by itself, but there might
be cases with extraction (&quot;John was understood to be an idiot&quot;) or
other cases where the two args are separate.  Try to keep things as a
single arg, if possible, but don't use the [A] command--just use args 
--1 and 2.

Latter examples is particularly interesting, as it's effectively
passivized, but the utterance is apparently too big to put in subject
position.  Cool.
