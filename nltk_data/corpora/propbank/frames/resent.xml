<text>
    Corporate executives resent that their company's stock has been
    transformed into a nameless piece of a stock-index basket.

<example name="with purpose">
  <text>
    John resents Mary for her perfect grade-point average.
  </text>
  <arg n="0">John</arg>
  <rel>resents</rel>
  <arg n="1">Mary</arg>
  <arg f="for" n="2">her perfect grade-point average</arg>
</example>

<note>
Note that args 1 and 2 can easily be merged: &quot;John resent's Mary's
perfect GPA.&quot;  This is why the reason for resentment deserves to be a
full-fledged Arg rather than an ArgM-PRP.
