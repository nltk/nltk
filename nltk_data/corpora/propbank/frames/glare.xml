     Her Pa (Howard Duff) is the kind of guy who, while saying grace
     at the supper table, [*-4] pauses at the word ``sin'' and glares
     at the daughter he hasn't seen for two decades, because he knows
     in his heart that she enjoyed what happened in the cold-storage
     room, and has been indulging the same taste ever since in the
     fleshpots of Chicago.
