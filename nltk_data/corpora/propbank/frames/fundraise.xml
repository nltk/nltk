    That impressed Robert B. Pamplin, Georgia-Pacific's chief
    executive at the time, whom Mr. Hahn had met while *trace*
    fundraising for the institute.

<note>
Ordinarily this would be &quot;so-and-so raised funds for X&quot; with &quot;funds&quot; in the
arg1 position, but &quot;funds&quot; has been glommed onto the verbs itself and
so cannot exist as an independent arg.  For consistency, though, the
beneficiary is left in arg2.
