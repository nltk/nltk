<note>
In most cases Treebank suggests an S-BAR as the object of &quot;announce&quot;; PReditor
selects the S inside the S-BAR as the Arg1.  I feel it really should be the
S-BAR, because of the cases like &quot;John said THAT he loved Mary&quot; where
the S-BAR is selected as Arg1, but in actual usage the complementizer
is usually dropped.  But since it would slow down throughput
*enormously* to retag all of these cases, we'll accept what PReditor
selects in both cases (with and without complementizer).
