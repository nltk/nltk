    4. When a RICO TRO is being sought, the prosecutor is required, at
       the earliest appropriate time, to state publicly that the
       government's request for a TRO, and eventual forfeiture, is
       made in full recognition of the rights of third parties -- that
       is, in requesting the TRO, the government will not seek to
       disrupt the normal, legitimate business activities of the
       defendant; will not seek through use of the relation-back
       doctrine to take from third parties assets legitimately
       transferred to them; will not seek [*-6] to vitiate legitimate
       business transactions occurring between the defendant and third
       parties; and will, in all other respects, assist the court in
       ensuring that the rights of third parties are protected,
       through proceeding under } RICO { and otherwise.
