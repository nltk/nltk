<note>
The attribute argument is necessary because of the way Treebank
divides the constituent.  Really, the arg1 of each of the two
sentences above are 'any documents regarding the penalty or fine' and
'a new takeover bid of $50 million a share', but the 'giver' argument
intervenes between the two, necessitating the additional argument.
