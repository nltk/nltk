    ``If they croak stocks like that,'' he said, it presents an
    opportunity that is ``the kind of thing you dream about.''

<note>
I take the 'stocks like that' as an appositive coindexed with 'they',
and suggest that a better parse would be 'if they croak, stocks like
that,...'  Croak just can't be a transitive verb.
