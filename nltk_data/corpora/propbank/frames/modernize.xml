<text>
    At the same time, steelmakers are trying *trace* to invest more
    *trace* to modernize technology and make themselves more
    competitive.

<note>
Seems to always occur in the infinitive, so be careful of where traces
point to.  An instrument arg is possible but I doubt it would actually
appear.
