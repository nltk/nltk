  Sea Containers' subsidiaries might be required *trace* to place
  their shares in the open market.

<note>
Compare to &quot;The FCC needed Sea Containers' subsidiaries to place their
shares on the open market&quot; and &quot;*Sea Containers' subsidiaries were
needed to place their shares on the open market&quot;.  The latter is
grammatical, but means something different.
