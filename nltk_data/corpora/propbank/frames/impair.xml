    The department would be required to block the buy-out if the
    acquisition is likely to financially weaken a carrier so that
    safety would be impaired [*-27]; its ability to compete would be

    the transaction would result in the sale of airline-related assets
    -- unless selling such assets had an overriding public benefit.
