What problems can Klaricid tablets cause?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Klaricid tablets can sometimes cause stomach problems such as feeling sick, vomiting, stomach pain or diarrhoea.  Headache has also been reported.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you develop severe or prolonged diarrhoea during or after taking Klaricid tablets, consult your doctor immediately.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you have a blood test while taking Klaricid it may show raised liver enzymes.  These levels usually return to normal and it is unlikely that you will show any symptoms.  However, Klaricid can rarely cause jaundice and other liver disorders, so if you feel generally unwell or develop yellow skin and/or eyes, consult your doctor immediately.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Allergic reactions including rashes have been reported with Klaricid.  In very rare cases, difficulty in breathing, fainting and swelling of the face and throat can occur which may need emergency treatment.  Allergic rashes may range in severity from mild itchy skin eruptions to a rarer, more serious condition called Stevens-Johnson syndrome which may cause ulceration of the mouth, lips and skin.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Some people taking Klaricid notice a funny taste in their mouth or a change in their sense of taste.  Sometimes the tongue darkens in colour.  However these are only temporary effects and you should not stop taking the tablets because of them.  There have also been reports of Klaricid sometimes causing a swollen tongue or a sore mouth.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
There have also been some reports of dizziness, difficulty sleeping, hallucinations (seeing things), bad dreams, confusion and panicking.  These effects are usually short-lived and soon disappear.  Very rarely, mood and behavioural disorders have been reported, which in severe cases have required hospitalisation.  Consult your doctor immediately if you develop any of these problems or have any other unexpected or unusual symptoms.
