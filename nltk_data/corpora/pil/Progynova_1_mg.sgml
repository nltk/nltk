What the "change of life" means
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
The "change of life" is a long process, normally occurring between the ages of 45 and 55 during which your reproductive organs are undergoing a slow decline. Although the change of life is natural, it often causes distressing symptoms, which are connected with the gradual loss of the hormones produced by the ovaries.

How Progynova 1 mg helps you through the "change of life"
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Progynova 1 mg is used for "hormone replacement therapy" because it contains the principal oestrogen hormone that is lost during the "change of life". Therefore, it replaces the oestrogen that your body can no longer make, and this prevents or improves the troublesome symptoms.

<BLOCK>
During or after the use of hormones such as are contained in Progynova 1 mg, benign liver tumours have rarely occurred, and even more rarely malignant liver tumours. In isolated cases, bleeding from such tumours into the abdomen has endangered life. Although such events are extremely improbable with Progynova 1 mg, you should inform your doctor about any unusual feelings in your upper abdomen that do not disappear within a short time.
