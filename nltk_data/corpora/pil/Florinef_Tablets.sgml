Q.Are there any unwanted effects of Florinef tablets?

<BLOCK>
A.All medicines may cause some unwanted or &quot;side effects&quot;. Some which can occur with steroid treatment are as follows. Tell your doctor immediately if you get ulcer pains in your stomach or severe pain in your abdomen. Patients have reported increased appetite, weight gain, indigestion, sickness, feeling tired or weak. Steroid treatment may cause increased risk of infection, thinning of bones or tendons causing fractures or torn muscles, water retention, irregular heart beat, high blood pressure or blood clots. Skin or eye problems may occur and wounds or broken bones may be slow to heal. Treatment with steroids can stop the body from producing some hormones and may slow or stop children’s growth rate. If you are female, your periods may become irregular. Elevation or depression of mood, sleeplessness and severe headaches have been reported. When steroid treatment is stopped, patients have noticed flu-like symptoms, runny nose or itchy eyes or skin. Remember you must 
<EMPH uline="plain">
not 
</EMPH>
stop taking your medicine too suddenly. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you notice any other troublesome side-effects.
