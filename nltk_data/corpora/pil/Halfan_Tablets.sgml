<BLOCK>
Following its stay in the liver, the parasite enters another stage of its life cycle by being released into the bloodstream. Here it penetrates red blood cells multiplies and causes the blood cells to burst, releasing large numbers of parasites. each able to infect a new red blood cell. The release of these parasites coincides with the malaria fever It takes two to three days for newly infected blood cells to release further parasites and this explains the well-known intermittent character of the fever. In some cases. the infection is so severe that the fever is continuous.

What are the symptoms of malaria?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
The incubation period following the bite of a mosquito bearing the infection is at least five to 10 days - but longer than a year may elapse before the symptoms appear. The principal symptoms are a continuous or intermittent fever with malaise, shivering, headache, tiredness, mental confusion. dizziness or muscle pains. Gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, loss of appetite or diarrhoea may also be present. Serious cases may involve jaundice, convulsions or coma.

Malaria should always be suspected in any person who has a fever or other worrying symptoms and has recently travelled to a malarial area. YOU MUST CONSULT A DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY.

What steps should be taken BEFORE you travel to a malarial region?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
You should always consult your doctor in advance of any travel to or through a malarial region - no matter how often you may have visited the country before. Preventative drugs can be prescribed; these drugs suppress the red blood cell forms of the parasite. They generally must be started one to two weeks before entering a malarial region (to ensure a sufficient blood level of the drug before any possible exposure to malaria). They are taken continuously during the visit and continued for four to eight weeks afterwards. It is important that any preventative drugs are taken exactly as prescribed, for the full course.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
NOTE: 'HALFAN' IS NOT A PREVENTATIVE DRUG.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
It is also vital that you receive the correct drug for the region to which you are travelling. In many parts of the world, the malaria parasite has become resistant to several of these preventative drugs.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
No drugs give long-term protection so a full new course is needed for each journey. Your doctor or health advisory agency can provide you with up-to-date information on the most appropriate form of preventative treatment for your travel requirements. A recorded telephone advice message on malaria prevention is available on 071-636 7921.

What personal measures can be taken to prevent mosquito bites?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
In addition to preventative drug therapy, it is important to take all possible measures to avoid mosquito bites. Protection against mosquitoes is also advisable if passing through a malarial region, or even pausing briefly in an airport transit lounge.
</BLOCK>

<CB n=2>

<BLOCK>
Some simple commonsense measures to reduce the risk of mosquito bites can greatly reduce the risk of developing malaria:
</BLOCK>


<LIST type="bulleted">
