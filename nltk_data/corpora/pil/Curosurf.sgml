Uses
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Curosurf is a natural surfactant used for the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS or hyaline membrane disease) in newborn babies, who have a minimum birthweight of 700 g.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>
<DIV type=1>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
Dosage and administration
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Curosurf should only be administered by those trained and experienced in the care and resuscitation of preterm infants. It is administered via the intratracheal route in intubated infants undergoing mechanical ventilation for respiratory distress syndrome and whose heart and arterial oxygen saturation are being continuously monitored. Intubation should not be undertaken merely to administer surfactant.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
It is advisable to commence the treatment as soon as possible after diagnosing RDS. Therapy with Curosurf starting more than 48 hours after diagnosing RDS has not been investigated.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Curosurf is available in ready-to-use vials that should be stored in a refrigerator at +2 to +8 C. The vial should be slowly warmed to 37 C before use, e.g. by holding it in an incubator for about one hour or in a thermostated bath for about three minutes, and gently turned upside down, without shaking, in order to obtain a uniform suspension.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The suspension should be withdrawn from the vial using a sterile needle and syringe.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Initially, a single dose of 100-200 mg/kg (1.252.5 ml/kg) is advised.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Up to two further doses of 100 mg/kg administered at about 12-hourly intervals may also be indicated in infants who remain intubated and in whom RDS is considered responsible for their persisting or deteriorating respiratory status (maximum total dose of 300-400 mg/kg).
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>

<EMPH slant = "italic">
The initial dose is administered as follows:
</EMPH>
 Disconnect the baby momentarily from the ventilator and administer 1.25 to 2.5ml/kg of suspension, as a single bolus, directly into the lower trachea via the endotracheal tube.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Perform approximately one minute of hand-bagging and then reconnect the baby to the ventilator at the same settings as before administration.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Further doses (1.25 ml/kg) that may be required are administered in the same manner.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
After administration of Curosurf and upon reconnection to the ventilator or immediately after pulmonary compliance (chest expansion) can improve rapidly thus requiring prompt adjustment of the ventilator settings.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The improvement of alveolar gas exchange can result in a rapid increase of arterial oxygen concentration: therefore, a rapid adjustment of the inspired oxygen concentration should be made to avoid hyperoxia. In order to maintain proper blood oxygenation values, in addition to periodic haemo-gas analysis, continuous monitoring of transcutaneous PaO2 or oxygen saturation, is also advisable.

Contra-indications, warnings etc.

</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>

<EMPH slant = "italic">
Contra-indications:
</EMPH>
 No specific contra-indications are yet known.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>

<EMPH weight="bold">
Precautions:
</EMPH>
 The baby's general condition should be stabilised. Correction of acidosis, hypotension, anaemia, hypoglycaemia and hypothermia is also recommended <CB n=2>
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Babies born following very prolonged rupture of the membranes (greater than 3 weeks) may not show optimal response.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Surfactant administration can be expected to reduce the severity of RDS but cannot be expected to eliminate entirely the mortality and morbidity associated with preterm birth, as preterm babies may be exposed to other complications of their immaturity.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
After administration a transient depression of cerebro-electrical activity has been recorded lasting 2 to 10 minutes. The impact of this is not clear.
</BLOCK>

Use in pregnancy and lactation:

Drug interactions:
</EMPH>
 None known.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>

<EMPH weight="bold">
Side-effects:
</EMPH>
 Pulmonary haemorrhage, the incidence of which increases the more immature is the infant, is a rare and sometimes fatal complication of preterm delivery. No evidence exists of any increased risk of this event following the administration of Curosurf .
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
No other undesirable effects have been reported.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>

<EMPH weight="bold">
Overdosage:
</EMPH>
 There have been no reports of overdosage following the administration of Curosurf.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
However, in the unlikely event of accidental overdose, and only if there are clear clinical effects on the infant's respiration, ventilation or oxygenation, as much of the suspension as possible should be aspirated and the baby should be managed with supportive treatment, with particular attention to fluid and electrolyte balance.

Why Curosurf?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Your baby has been given Curosurf because he/she is suffering from a condition called respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Most babies are born with a substance known as surfactant in their lungs. This substance lines the lungs and stops them from sticking together and so makes normal breathing (respiration) possible. Some babies, however, particularly premature babies, are born with a lack of this surfactant which causes RDS.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Curosurf is a natural surfactant which works in the same way as your baby's own surfactant would have done and, therefore, will help your baby to breathe normally until your baby produces his or her own surfactant.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>

<EMPH slant = "italic">
Note:
</EMPH>
 Curosurf is expected to help in the treatment of RDS but cannot be expected to help with other problems which are sometimes associated with premature babies <CB n=2>
</BLOCK>


</DIV>
<DIV type=1>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
How many doses will your baby have?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
It is important that Curosurf is given as soon as possible after RDS has been diagnosed. Your baby will be/has been given one dose and may receive another two doses at l2 hourly intervals: your doctor will decide how much is necessary for your baby.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>
<DIV type=1>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
How will Curosurf be given to your baby?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Curosurf is given to your baby whilst it is in the incubator. It is given through tubes into the baby's trachea (windpipe).
</BLOCK>


</DIV>
<DIV type=1>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
Can Curosurf cause side-effects?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
All medicines can cause side-effects. However, clinical studies on several thousands of newborn babies with RDS did not demonstrate any side effects of surfactant therapy.
