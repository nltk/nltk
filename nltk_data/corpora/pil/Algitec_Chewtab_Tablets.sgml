What is 'Algitec' and how does it work?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
'Algitec' is an antacid. If the acid from your stomach comes up into your gullet (reflux) it can cause pain and inflammation. 'Algitec' can help to treat this in two ways. In your stomach, the alginate (alginic acid) makes a frothy layer or raft which floats on the stomach contents and helps to prevent them coming up into your gullet. The cimetidine (which is a histamine H2 receptor antagonist) helps to reduce the amount of acid being produced in your stomach, so even it the contents get through the alginate ran, there is much less acid to cause any damage.

What else can be done to reduce symptoms? IN ADDITION

 to the prescribed course of 'Algitec', a number of practical measures can help.
</BLOCK>


<LIST type="ordered">

<ITEM>

<BLOCK>

<EMPH weight="bold">
Reduce weight
</EMPH>
 - If you are overweight, this can &quot;squeeze&quot; the stomach. A sensible weight-reducing diet will help to ease this pressure on the stomach and reduce reflux.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>

<EMPH weight="bold">
Meals
</EMPH>
 - Don't rush your food or eat in a 'hunched-up&quot; position. Eat regular, sensible meals. Try to avoid eating or drinking late at night or before you go to bed.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>

<EMPH weight="bold">
Smoking
</EMPH>
 - As well as the well-known dangers of smoking, it has been shown that smoking stops the valve-like muscle at the bottom of the gullet from working properly. Stopping smoking, or greatly cutting down, will help your reflux.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>

<EMPH weight="bold">
Sleeping
</EMPH>
 - When you are Iying down it is easier for the stomach contents to &quot;leak&quot; into the oesophagus (gullet) causing heartburn. Raising the head of your bed on wooden blocks or bricks can help a great deal .
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>

<EMPH weight="bold">
Activity
</EMPH>
 - Try to avoid bending or stooping, whenever possible. Try to kneel instead and keep your back straight. Wear loose-fitting clothes if you can.
