What your tablets do
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Pylorid tablets belong to a new class of medicine that combines H2-antagonist properties with action against the bacterium (germ) Helicobacter pylori, and protection of the gut lining.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The H2-antagonist activity in your medicine reduces the amount of acid produced by your stomach. The germ Helicobacter pylori can make ulcers return. Your medicine works against this germ in your gut, and so stops ulcers from coming back.
