How much should I give my child and how often?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Follow your doctor's directions about how and when to give your child Amoxil.  Please read the dispensing label carefully.  Your pharmacist or doctor can help if you are not sure.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Amoxil syrup should be given using the 5 ml spoon provided by the pharmacist.  It is best for your child to take the medicine direct from the spoon.  However, if necessary, the dose may be stirred into a few spoonfuls of cold water or infant drink (not milk).  Make sure the whole dose is swallowed each time.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Space the doses as evenly as possible through the day.
