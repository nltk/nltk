First, wash your hands. Remove the strip of containers from the foil pouch, then pull off one of the containers from the end of the strip - it will break off quite easily (Fig. 1). To put the drops into your eye, twist the top off the container (Fig. 2). Then tilt your head backwards and pull the bottom lid of your eye downwards to form a pocket (Fig. 3). Hold the Unit Dose container in your other hand between your thumb and your first finger. Place the tip close to your lower eyelid and squeeze the container gently (Fig. 4). One drop of solution should fall into your eye. Put the container down and press your finger against the inside corner of your eye for at least a minute - this helps stop the drops from draining down the back of your nose into <CB n=2> your throat.

WHEN SHOULD YOU USE THE DROPS?

<EMPH weight="bold">
HOW MANY DROPS SHOULD YOU USE?
</EMPH>

</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
You should use the drops as your doctor has told you. The dose will depend on your condition, how quickly you respond, and whether you are taking any other treatment. Usually the first dose is one drop of 0.25% solution twice a day: some people need a stronger dose, and others need less. Your doctor will change your treatment as necessary.
