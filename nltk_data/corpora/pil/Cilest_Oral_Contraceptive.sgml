Why you should read this leaflet
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
This leaflet contains important information about your Cilest pills.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Please read it carefully before you start taking Cilest. If you have any questions about what is written here or wish for any further information please ask either your doctor, nurse or pharmacist (chemist).

How does your body get ready for pregnancy?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
You are able to become pregnant throughout your fertile years, that is to say from the time when you start to have menstrual periods until you reach the age when your periods stop (usually your late 40s).
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The time between the beginning of one menstrual period and the next is called the menstrual cycle. It lasts about 28 days. In the middle of the menstrual cycle one of the ovaries releases an egg into a Fallopian tube (see picture)- this is called ovulation. The egg moves down the Fallopian tube towards the womb.
</BLOCK>

<FIGURE></FIGURE>

<BLOCK>
The egg will then either be fertilised by one sperm (conception) or discarded with the lining of the womb (menstrual period).
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
For the egg to be fertilised, it must encounter a sperm in the Fallopian tube. When you have sex, your partner releases millions of sperms into your vagina; some of the sperms travel up through the womb into the Fallopian tubes.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If there is an egg in a Fallopian tube, one sperm will fertilise it. The fertilised egg will move towards the womb, become implanted in the lining and start growing into a baby.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If the egg does not encounter a sperm in the Fallopian tube and is not fertilised, it will be discarded with the lining of the womb at the end of the menstrual cycle and you will have a period.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>

</DIV>
<DIV type=1>

<HEAD>
It is important to know that
</HEAD>


<LIST type="bulleted">

<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
a released egg can live for up 2 days;
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
sperms can live for up to 5 days within a woman's body; so if you have unprotected sex up to 5 days before ovulation or a few days after it you may become pregnant.

<DIV type=2>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
How do your natural hormones work?
</HEAD>


</DIV>

</DIV>
<DIV type=1>

<HEAD>
Your ovaries make two hormones which control your menstrual cycle; these are called
</HEAD>


<LIST type="bulleted">

<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
oestrogen
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
progesterone
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>

</LIST>



<BLOCK>
During the first part of your menstrual cycle (before ovulation) your body is preparing itself for pregnancy; more oestrogen is produced because it makes the lining of the womb thicker so that a fertilised egg can grow in it.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
During the second part of the cycle (after ovulation) more progesterone is produced. This stops the growth of the lining of the womb.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If the egg is not fertilised, the amounts of the two hormones decrease and this makes the lining of the womb break down. The lining will be discarded together with the unfertilised egg as a menstrual bleed .
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If the egg is fertilised, the two hormones will continue to be produced throughout pregnancy. 
<EMPH slant = "italic">
The presence of high levels of these two hormones stops
</EMPH>
 <CB n=2> 
<EMPH slant = "italic">
your ovaries releasing any other eggs,
</EMPH>
 to prevent any further conceptions during pregnancy.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Pills such as Cilest protect you against pregnancy because they contain two synthetic hormones similar to those produced by your body. While taking Cilest your ovaries will not release eggs, so there will be no eggs to be fertilised by the male sperm. These pills also thicken vaginal fluid so that sperm cannot get to the womb and they change the lining of the womb so that eggs cannot grow there.
</BLOCK>

<DIV type=2>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
How effective is the pill?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
The pill is an extremely effective method of contraception 
<EMPH slant = "italic">
if taken properly
</EMPH>
. So you must take the pill exactly as described in this leaflet (see section "How you should take Cilest").
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
It is important to remember that no form of contraception, not even the pill can offer 100% protection against pregnancy.

<DIV type=2>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
Special Warnings:
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Cilest should not be used while breast feeding as it may reduce the amount of breast milk.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
You should have talked to your doctor about any present and past medical problems as listed above and have had a full examination, including a cervical smear and any necessary other tests, before starting to take the pill. These should be repeated regularly.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious side-effects to oral contraceptive use, such as heart and blood vessel problems, blood clots/thrombosis.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
You are strongly advised to give up smoking especially if you are aged over 35 years.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If your periods are not regular before you start taking the pill you should tell your doctor.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Cilest should not be used for 4 6 weeks before an operation/surgery and not used again until 2 weeks after you are fully mobile. This also applies to any situation where you may need to rest or be immobile for some time.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Some women may develop patches of darkened skin whilst taking Cilest. This is more likely to happen if you developed patches of darkened skin during a previous pregnancy. If you develop such patches, you should avoid the sun and ultraviolet light (sunbeds). These patches of darkened skin may not disappear even when you have stopped taking the pill.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Cilest may affect the results of certain blood andurine tests - please tell the doctor/nurse that you are taking Cilest when you have any such tests.
</BLOCK>

<DIV type=2>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
How you should take Cilest
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
The pill is a very effective contraceptive when used properly. It is important to take Cilest exactly as your doctor told you and as stated below:
</BLOCK>

<DIV type=3>

<HEAD ltag="bullet" >
When to start
</HEAD>




<BLOCK>
It is best that you start taking Cilest on the first day of your period - if you do this no extra contraceptive cover is required.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If your period has already begun, start taking Cilest on day 5 (counting the first day of period as day 1) whether or not your bleeding has stopped. In this case, extra contraception (e.g. condoms) must be used for the first 7 days of pill taking.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If your period started more than 5 days ago do not start taking Cilest until the first day of your next period. Use extra contraception until then.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>
<DIV type=3>

<HEAD ltag="bullet" >
How to take Cilest
</HEAD>




<BLOCK>
Cilest comes in a pack marked with the days of the week. Take your first pill marked with the right day.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Each day take the pill for that day and do this for the 27 pills in the pack. It is best to take your pill at around the same time each day - most people find it easier to remember taking it before bedtime.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
When you have taken all 21 pills and the pack is empty leave a break of exactly 7 days after the last pill and the start of your next pack.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
During this "pill-free" week you should have some days of bleeding similar to a "period".
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Start your next pack of Cilest after exactly seven "pill-free" days. Each new pack of Cilest will begin on the same day of the week as the previous pack; so it is easy to remember when to start again.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Continue with this pack and future packs in the same way as described above.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you take Cilest as above, extra contraception is not required.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
NB: In some cases your doctor may tell you to start taking your next pack without leaving a 7 day gap. (See "Extra contraception: The 7 day rule").
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you do not have any bleeding during the "pill-free" week of any pack and if you have no other reason why Cilest should not have worked properly (i.e. you did not have to use extra contraception - see later) then you are highly unlikely to be pregnant. Start your next pack of Cilest even though you have not had a period. If you still do not have a period during the "pill-free" week of this pack, go to your doctor. He/she will check that you are not pregnant before you continue to take Cilest.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you do not have any bleeding during the "pill-free" week of any pack and you have a reason why Cilest may not have worked properly i.e. you 
<EMPH slant = "italic">
DID
</EMPH>
 need to use extra contraception (see later) go to your doctor. He/she will check that you are not pregnant before you re-start Cilest.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>
<DIV type=3>

<HEAD ltag="bullet" >
After being pregnant/having a baby
</HEAD>




<BLOCK>
You can start using Cilest after 21 days if you are not breast-feeding and you had a vaginal delivery with no complications and you are fully mobile.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you do have intercourse before you start taking Cilest or before you first period wait until your period starts before you take Cilest and then take it on the first day of bleeding. This is because you can get pregnant very soon after having a baby and you have to make sure that you are not pregnant before taking Cilest.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you start taking Cilest more than 21 days after delivery and you haven't had intercourse or a period you should use extra contraception for the first 7 days.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you are breastfeeding you should not use Cilest or any other combined oral contraceptive as this may affect your breast milk. You may be able to use a progestogen only pill - discuss this with your doctor.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>
<DIV type=3>

<HEAD ltag="bullet" >

How safe is the pill?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
The pill is one of the most thoroughly tested products of medical research and vast experience has confirmed that it can be safely used by most women BUT 
<EMPH weight="bold">
it is important to know that even if a product has been used by a great number of patients for a large number of years, it is not possible to guarantee that the product is completely safe for all patients, because each person is unique. So, with the pill (as with any other medicine}, some risk to health must be accepted.
</EMPH>

</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
What side effects may Cilest have?
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
As with any other oral contraceptive pill, Cilest may cause some unwanted effects but this is not common. The most serious side effects are:
</BLOCK>


<LIST type="ordered">

<ITEM>

<BLOCK>

<EMPH weight="bold">
Blood clots and thrombosis which can occur in different blood vessels causing problems such as a pulmonary embolus {blood clot in the lung}, a stroke or a heart attack. These are rare but serious and may be fatal.
</EMPH>

</BLOCK>

</ITEM>

</LIST>



<BLOCK>
Certain conditions themselves increase the risk of thrombosis: heavy smoking, obesity, severe varicose veins, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, migraine, diabetes. If any of these conditions applies to you, you have a greater risk of having a thrombosis. This risk is increased if you take Cilest.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The signs and symptoms of a blood clot are described under "Reasons for stopping Cilest immediately"; if you develop any of those signs or symptoms, stop taking Cilest at once and see your doctor.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Women who do not take the oral contraceptive pill can also have blood clots and thrombosis, but statistics show that women who take the pill have a higher risk of these disorders than those who don't. It is thought that the risk of thrombosis is lower for modern pills such as Cilest, because they contain lower levels of oestrogen than the older types of pill.
</BLOCK>


<LIST type="ordered">

<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
There have been many studies of women taking combined oral contraceptives (COC's) looking at the effect of these pills on the risk of developing cancer of the ovary, uterus, cervix and breast. These have <PB n=4> <CB n=2> shown clearly that COCs offer good protection against cancer of the ovary and uterus.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>

</LIST>



<BLOCK>
Some studies showed an increased risk of cancer of the cervix in women using COCs for a long time but it is not clear whether this is due to other factors such as sexual behaviour or to the COCs alone.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The link between COC use and breast cancer is not yet clear. Some studies suggest an increased risk of breast cancer appearing in under 35 year olds and that this risk increases with the length of use of the pill. If there is a possible increased risk of breast cancer with COCs it is likely to be small and expected to be less with pills containing low oestrogen doses, such as Cilest. This possible risk should be balanced against the many other benefits of COCs which includes the protection which they provide against cancer of the uterus and ovary.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
You should always have regular cervical smears and breast examinations whilst you are taking Cilest.

What if you decide to have a baby?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
The periods you get during the "pill free" week are not true periods. It is important that you have a true period before getting pregnant so that your doctor is able to know when your baby is due to be born. So once you have stopped taking Cilest because you wish to try to become pregnant, use another method of contraception until you have had a true period.
