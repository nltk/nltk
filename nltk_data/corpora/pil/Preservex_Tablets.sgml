What is Preservex?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Preservex is one of a group of medicines called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDs.  Specifically, Preservex is from the class of NSAIDs derived from phenylacetic acid.  The active ingredient in Preservex is aceclofenac.  Preservex works by blocking chemicals called prostaglandins.  Prostaglandins are released at the site of an injury and are responsible for producing pain and inflammation following tissue damage and immune reactions.  By preventing the synthesis of these chemicals Preservex reduces inflammation and pain associated with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Each tablet contains 100 mg of the active ingredient aceclofenac, and a number of inactive ingredients used to bind and coat the tablet (these are microcrystalline cellulose, sodium croscarmellose, polyvidone, glyceryl palmitostearate, and the film coat, containing partially substituted hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, polyoxyethylene 40 stearate and titanium dioxide).
