Duovent UDVs (Unit Dose Vials) contain a solution of two medicines called ipratropium bromide and fenoterol hydrobromide.  Both are bronchodilators which help to open up the air passages in your lungs so that you can breath more easily.

<BLOCK>
Please keep your Duovent UDVs safely away from heat or light (for example in a cupboard) and out of the sight and reach of children.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Before using Duovent UDVs please take some time to read the following guidelines and precautions but remember – if you have any questions about your treatment, ask your doctor.
