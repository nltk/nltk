</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Although you may have undergone a series of tests before your organ or bone marrow transplant to ensure that the match between your body and the transplanted organ or bone marrow was as close as possible, the donor tissue will still not be identical to your tissue. As a result, your body’s immune system will try to reject the donor tissue. 
<EMPH weight="bold">
SANDIMMUN 
</EMPH>
helps to stop this rejection response by blocking the development of special cells which would normally attack the transplanted tissue.

TAKING YOUR MEDICINE
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Your doctor will work out the correct dose of 
<EMPH weight="bold">
SANDIMMUN 
</EMPH>
for you depending on your body weight and whether you are taking 
<EMPH weight="bold">
SANDIMMUN 
</EMPH>
following a transplant or as a treatment for severe psoriasis, eczema or rheumatoid arthritis. Your doctor will also tell you how often to take your medicine.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you have had an organ or bone marrow transplant the total dose is usually within the range of 2mg/kg body weight per day and 15mg/kg body weight per day. Generally, the higher doses are used just after transplantation and the lower doses are used once your transplanted organ or bone marrow has stabilised. Your doctor will adjust your dose to one that is ideal for you. To do this, he may need to do some blood tests.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
For the treatment of severe psoriasis and eczema the total dose is usually within the range of 2.5mg/kg body weight per day and 5mg/kg body weight per day.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
For the treatment of severe rheumatoid arthritis, the total daily dose is usually within the range of 2.5mg/kg body weight per day and 4mg/kg body weight per day.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Your doctor will tell you how much 
<EMPH weight="bold">
SANDIMMUN 
</EMPH>
to take and how long you will need to take 
<EMPH weight="bold">
SANDIMMUN 
</EMPH>
for, depending on whether you are taking 
<EMPH weight="bold">
SANDIMMUN 
</EMPH>
following transplantation, or for the treatment of a severe skin condition, or rheumatoid arthritis. For the treatment of severe eczema, treatment usually lasts for 8 weeks.

AFTER TAKING YOUR MEDICINE
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Most people benefit from taking this medicine, but a few people can be upset by it.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The dose of this medicine needs to be carefully adjusted by your doctor. Too much can affect the kidneys. You will, therefore, have regular blood tests and visits to the hospital, particularly after transplantation. Your blood pressure will also be measured regularly. These visits will give you the chance to talk to your doctor about your treatment and mention any problems you are having.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you develop a sore throat, any infections or begin to feel generally unwell see your doctor immediately.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Side-effects that have sometimes been reported in patients taking 
<EMPH weight="bold">
SANDIMMUN
</EMPH>
 include shakiness of the hands, upset stomach or abdominal pain, altered bowel habit, swollen gums, increased growth of hair on the body or face, high blood pressure, liver problems, tiredness, and sensations of heat in the hands and feet.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
More rarely, headaches, skin rash, increased weight, fluid retention, confusion, feelings of numbness or tingling, muscle weakness or cramps, fits, gout, raised cholesterol levels, slight swelling of the breast tissue, changes in the menstrual period in women and tumours have also been reported.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
In liver transplant patients vision and movement disturbances, and loss of concentration have also been reported as side-effects. However, although these effects have been reported in patients taking 
<EMPH weight="bold">
SANDIMMUN
</EMPH>
, they may not have actually been due to the medicine.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you suffer from any of these effects, or from any other side-effects not mentioned in this leaflet.
