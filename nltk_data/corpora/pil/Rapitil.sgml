WHAT ARE YOUR EYE DROPS FOR?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Rapitil eye drops are used for the prevention, relief and treatment of red, itchy eyes caused by a number of allergic conditions. These can occur at any time of the year eg due to animal fur or house dust mites - known as perennial allergic conjunctivitis or PAC or seasonally due to pollens (hayfever) - known as seasonal allergic conjunctivitis or SAC. Rapitil eye drops are also used for a more severe form of allergic conjunctivitis called vernal kerato conjunctivitis, with thickened eye lids due to swelling of the lining of the lid.
