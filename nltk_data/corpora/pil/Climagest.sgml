How does CLIMAGEST work?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
CLIMAGEST tablets contain the hormones oestradiol valerate and norethisterone. These hormones are designed to replace the hormones which are lost during the decline in the function of the ovaries after the menopause. Tablets of this kind are often known as Hormone Replacement Therapy or HRT.
</BLOCK>

What is CLIMAGEST for?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
In middle age, typically between the ages of 45 and 55, a natural process occurs in women, during which the levels of female hormones found in the body decline. These hormones are produced by the ovaries and at the end of this process, which is often called the 'change of life', climacteric or menopause, the ovaries cease to function.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
In some women, the drop in hormone levels causes certain symptoms, the best known of which are hot flushes, sweating, tiredness, sleeplessness and depression. Other symptoms include dizziness, head- ache, palpitations (flutterings in the chest), tingling in the hands and feet and discomfort during sexual intercourse.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Few women will have all of these symptoms and the number, frequency, severity and duration of them varies from one woman to another.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
CLIMAGEST is designed to relieve the symptoms associated with the menopause by replacing the hormones lost during the decline in the function of the ovaries. You will still have a regular monthly bleed or period, much like before your menopause.
</BLOCK>

Before taking your CLIMAGEST tablets
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
You should read this section carefully because there are some conditions your doctor should know about before you start your treatment. Ask yourself the following questions before you start to take your tablets. Have you ever suffered or do you currently suffer from:
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Liver problems, for example jaundice.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Heart or kidney disease.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Clotting in blood vessels (the medical term for this is thromboembolism) e.g. in the legs or lungs, heart attack or stroke.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Persistent irregular bleeding from the vagina.
</BLOCK>

<DIV type=2>

<HEAD>
Any condition affected by hormones e.g. tumours of the breast or womb
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Remember, tell your doctor or pharmacist, if the answer is yes to any of these questions.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
You should not take CLIMAGEST if you are pregnant or if you think you are pregnant and you should not breast feed while taking it.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you are unsure about anything, ask for advice from your doctor or pharmacist.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>

</DIV>
<DIV type=1>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
Are you taking any other medicine?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
The hormones in CLIMAGEST supplement your own natural hormones and are unlikely to react with other medicines. However, you should always tell your doctor about any other medicines you are taking, including ones you have bought yourself.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>
<DIV type=1>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
Accidents, illnesses and operations
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Your doctor may stop your CLIMAGEST tablets if you are about to have an operation or if you suffer an injury or illness where there may be an increased risk of blood clotting or if your blood pressure rises significantly for the first time.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>
<DIV type=1>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
Check ups whilst taking CLIMAGEST
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
While you are taking Climagest you should see your doctor regularly, at least every 6 to 12 months. You should have a thorough internal (vaginal) and physical examination before and at regular times during your treatment.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you have mild chronic liver disease, your liver function will be checked every 8-12 weeks. Your doctor will also keep a closer eye on you if you suffer from gallstones or some diseases, including multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, migraine, diabetes, high blood pressure, hearing impairment due to bone deposits in the ear, tetany, uterine fibroids, and porphyria.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
You will also be monitored and receive regular checks from your doctor if you have any significant kidney or heart impairment.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you have had or currently suffer from breast nodules or fibrocystic disease your doctor may want to keep a careful check on you.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
It is recommended that all women regularly check their breasts. HRT may increase the risk of breast cancer very slightly if it is used for longer than five years, so it is especially important to check your breasts regularly. If you do not know how to do this yourself, your doctor or practice nurse can show you how. They may also check your breasts for you at your regular appointments and in addition, you may also have a breast scan (a 'mammography') at your doctor's surgery or at hospital.

Contraception whilst taking CLIMAGEST
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
CLIMAGEST is not intended to be used as an oral contraceptive.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you are using an oral or other hormonal contraceptive, e.g. the 'pill' or depot injection, you must  change to a non-hormonal contraceptive, for example a diaphragm or condom, BEFORE starting CLIMAGEST.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If your doctor has already told you that you no longer need to use any form of contraception, you do not need to do so whilst taking CLIMAGEST even if you experience monthly bleeding.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>

Bleeding whilst taking CLIMAGEST
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Whether you are still having periods or not CLIMAGEST will usually cause you to bleed during the week after you have completed each pack, i.e. the first week of your new pack. This may not always be the case, but you should have a bleed at the same time each monthly cycle.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
When treatment with CLIMAGEST is first started you may have some irregular bleeding. This is common during the first few months. It is usually temporary and wears off with time, however if it persists you should tell your doctor.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
As with normal periods the amount of bleeding will vary from one woman to another but is not usually heavy.
</BLOCK>
