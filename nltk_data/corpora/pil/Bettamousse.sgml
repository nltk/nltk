How to use this medicine.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>

</LIST>



<BLOCK>
The mousse should be massaged into the skin of the scalp, and left during the day or evening to take effect The mousse should be applied to the affected areas twice a day, each time using no more than a golf-ball sized amount in total. Once the condition is controlled, this can be reduced to once a day or less Bettamousse should always be used sparingly so use as little as possible when covering the affected areas.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
As with all steroid preparations, your doctor will want you to use as little as possible to control the problem, for the shortest possible time You may find that once the condition is controlled, you need only use it every few days to keep it in check.
</BLOCK>
