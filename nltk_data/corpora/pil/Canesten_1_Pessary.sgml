WHAT IS VAGINAL THRUSH?
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Thrush (vaginal candidiasis) is a common infection caused by a fungus which may live harmlessly in the vagina without you even noticing it.  However, in certain circumstances, it may develop into an infection in the vagina and the symptoms may spread to the surrounding area.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The common symptoms of thrush are:
</BLOCK>


<LIST type="bulleted">

HOW TO USE CANESTEN 1 PESSARY
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
The carton contains a single Canesten 1 Pessary held inside a foil blister pack and an applicator for insertion of the pessary into the vagina.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Special care should be taken when using the applicator if you are pregnant.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Place the Canesten 1 Pessary in the applicator, which should be used to insert the pessary into the vagina at night before going to sleep.
</BLOCK>

<FIGURE></FIGURE>

<BLOCK>

<EMPH weight="bold">
Remove the applicator from the packaging.  Pull out plunger A until it stops.  Remove the pessary from the blister pack and place the pessary firmly into applicator B (Diagram 1).  To fit the pessary into the applicator, the holder of the applicator needs to be squeezed lightly at either side.  The pessary fits tightly into the applicator and needs to be squeezed into the holder just far enough to be held in place during insertion (about 1cm).
</EMPH>

</BLOCK>

<PB n=4>
<CB n=1>

<BLOCK>
Carefully put the applicator as deeply as is comfortable into the vagina (this is easiest when lying on your back with your knees bent up) (Diagram 2).
</BLOCK>

<FIGURE></FIGURE>

<BLOCK>
Holding the applicator in place, slowly press the plunger until it stops so that the pessary is deposited into the vagina (Diagram 3).
</BLOCK>

<FIGURE></FIGURE>

<BLOCK>
Remove the applicator.  Dispose of the applicator in a safe place, out of the reach of children.
</BLOCK>

.  Don't put it in your mouth <CB n=2> or swallow it.  If you do accidentally swallow it, tell your doctor straight away or contact the Accident and Emergency Department of your nearest hospital.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
THINGS TO LOOK OUT FOR AFTER USING CANESTEN 1 PESSARY The symptoms of thrush such as burning, soreness or itching of the vagina and surrounding area should disappear within three days of treatment.  If no improvement is seen after seven days tell your doctor
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Canesten 1 Pessary may rarely cause side-effects in some people.  The side-effects are very similar to the symptoms of thrush.  If the redness, burning, irritation or swelling get worse, see your doctor as soon as possible.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you feel you are reacting badly to this medicine in any other way, discuss this with your doctor or pharmacist (chemist).

HOW YOU CAN HELP PREVENT FURTHER INFECTIONS
</HEAD>


<LIST type="bulleted">

<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
Try to avoid wearing tights, nylon knickers and close fitting jeans too often.  These provide warm and airless conditions which help the thrush fungus to grow.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>

</LIST>




<LIST type="bulleted">

<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
Wash daily, but use simple, bland soaps - not heavily scented or medicated ones.  Don’t scrub hard with sponges or flannels, and avoid hot baths with strong perfumed oils or disinfectants.  The most soothing bath to have, if you have thrush, is a warm one with some salt in it.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
After going to the toilet do get into the habit of wiping yourself from front to back, as a thrush infection can easily be transferred from the bowel.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>

</LIST>



<BLOCK>
If you are still worried or have any further questions about the symptoms or the treatment, don’t hesitate to ask your doctor’s or pharmacist's advice.
