Why does your doctor want you to use NORPROLAC tablets ?
</EMPH>

</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
NORPROLAC is used to treat patients with conditions which result from having high levels of prolactin in the blood. Prolactin is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland. High levels may cause excess milk production, changes in menstrual bleeding patterns, infertility and reduced sexual drive.
