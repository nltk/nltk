WHAT IS IN THE PACK?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
The name of your medicine is NEURONTIN capsules. NEURONTIN capsules are available in three strengths and contain either 100 mg, 300 mg or 400 mg of the active ingredient, gabapentin. Each capsule strength is a different colour; NEURONTIN 100 mg capsules are white, NEURONTIN 300 mg capsules are yellow and NEURONTIN 400 mg capsules are orange. Gabapentin works by affecting a chemical in the brain that is involved in sending nerve impulses (messages). NEURONTIN capsules also contain lactose, starch, talc, gelatin and the colourings E171 and E172. These ingredients help in the composition of NEURONTIN capsules, but are not active ingredients.
