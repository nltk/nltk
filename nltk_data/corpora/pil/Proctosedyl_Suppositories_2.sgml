How should you use your medicine?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
One Proctosedyl suppository should be inserted into the back passage in the morning and at bedtime and after every time you empty your bowels, or as your doctor told you. Wash your hands before and after inserting the suppository. Proctosedyl Suppositories can be used together with a cream or ointment antihaemorrhoidal (pile) preparation.

<BLOCK>
The treatment should last for one week. If you are still having problems after this, see your doctor again.

What about side effects?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Like all medicines, Proctosedyl Suppositories may cause you some problems, although these are rare. Some patients find that they suffer from itching, irritation, or pain, or a rash might develop around the hack passage. If you suffer badly from this or have other problems that you think your medicine may be causing, tell your doctor or pharmacist.

<BLOCK>
Regular use may suppress your adrenal gland which the body needs to combat stress. If you use Proctosedyl regularly discuss with your doctor first.
