How should I use Suprefact?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Follow your doctor's advice about when and how to use your medicine and look at the label and leaflet. Your pharmacist may also help if you are not sure.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The usual dose needed to reduce hormone production is two sprays (one into each nostril) six times a day. This is best taken as one spray into each nostril before and after breakfast, one spray into each nostril before and after the midday meal and one spray into each nostril before and after the evening meal.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
To keep hormone levels lowered, it is very important to take all your Suprefact doses regularly every day.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
You can continue to use Suprefact if you have a cold. Blow your nose well before using the spray. If you are using a nasal decongestant do not use the decongestant for at least 30 minutes after you have used Suprefact.

If you miss a dose of Suprefact, take another as soon as you remember unless it is nearly time for your next dose. Never double-up on the next dose to make up for the one you missed.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you take too much Suprefact tell your doctor.
