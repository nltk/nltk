How should I use Suprecur?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Follow your doctor's advice about when and how to use your medicine and look at the label and leaflet. Your pharmacist may also help if you are not sure. You should start treatment on the first or second day of your period.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The usual dose for the treatment of endometriosis is two sprays (one into each nostril) three times a day. This is best taken in the morning, at mid-day and in the evening. For use as part of infertility the usual dose is one spray (in one nostril only) four times a day. Some clinics use higher doses.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
It is very important to use Suprecur at regular intervals throughout the waking hours.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
You can continue to use Suprecur if you have a cold. Blow your nose well before using the spray. If you are using a nasal decongestant do not use the decongestant for at least 30 minutes after you have used Suprecur.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you miss a dose of Suprecur, take another as soon as you remember unless it is nearly time for your next dose. Never double-up on the next dose to make up for the one you missed.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you take too much Suprecur tell your doctor as soon as possible.

What undesirable effects may Suprecur cause?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Any medicine can have side-effects.
</BLOCK>

<CB n=2>

<BLOCK>
You will probably have a period during the first few weeks of treatment. After this your periods will probably stop, although some people may bleed again.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
You may notice symptoms such as hot flushes, sweating or you may have a dry vagina, decreased interest in sex or find intercourse painful.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Cysts (swellings) can sometimes occur in the ovaries with buserelin but do not interfere with treatment.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
During long term treatment the amount of calcium in bone may decrease. Most of the calcium is regained when treatment is stopped.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Some people find that the nasal spray irritates the nose and may even cause nosebleeds or make you feel hoarse. If you have any problems tell your doctor. Most people do not have any other side effects to Suprecur. However, if you notice any of the following, tell your doctor and ask if you should continue using the nasal spray:

How should I store Suprecur?
