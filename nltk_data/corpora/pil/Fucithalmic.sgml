What should I remember when using the drops?

<LIST type="bulleted">

<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
When the tube is squeezed Fucithalmic comes out as a thick (viscous) drop. The drop quickly becomes liquid in your eye so that you can still see clearly and so your ability to drive or operate machinery is not affected.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>

<BLOCK>
Fucithalmic is used twice a day, one drop in the morning and one drop in the evening. 
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>

If you forget to use the drops at the right time, use them as soon as you remember. Then go on as before.
