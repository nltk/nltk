HOW TO USE YOUR SEREVENT DISKHALER
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
This leaflet shows you how to use your Serevent Diskhaler inhaler with the medicine which your doctor has prescribed for you.  The medicine comes in small circular foil disks.  There are four blisters around the edge of each foil and these blisters each contain a measured dose of your medicine as a powder which you breathe in using the Serevent Diskhaler inhaler.
