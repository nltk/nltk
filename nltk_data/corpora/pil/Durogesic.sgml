What if the patch leaks?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Durogesic patches are sealed and should not leak. If the patch does leak onto your skin wash it off straight away with lots of water. Do not use soap or other cleansers. Fold the leaking patch gently in half so that the sticky side sticks to itself. Then put this patch back into its pouch or a plastic bag. You should then stick a new patch on as shown in this leaflet. Please take the leaking patch to your pharmacist.

What do I do with my used Durogesic patches?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Always keep used patches safely out of the reach of children and animals.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
As soon as you take a patch off fold it firmly in half so that the sticky side sticks to itself and put it back into its original pouch. Now put the pouch in the bin you use for your household rubbish. Even used patches contain some active medicine which may harm children or animals. So make sure your used patches are always kept well away from children or animals.
