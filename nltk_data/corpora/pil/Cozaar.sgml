HOW DO YOUR TABLETS WORK?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
‘Cozaar’ belongs to a group of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. Angiotensin II is a chemical occurring in the body, <CB n=1> <FIGURE></FIGURE> which tightens your blood vessels making it harder for the blood to pass through them and causing your blood pressure to increase. ‘Cozaar’ blocks this effect of angiotensin II, causing the blood vessels to relax, and so lowers your blood pressure.

WHY DO YOU NEED TO TAKE THESE TABLETS?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Your doctor has prescribed ‘Cozaar’ because you have a condition known as hypertension or high blood pressure <PB n=3> <CB n=2> <FIGURE></FIGURE> <CB n=1>
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Blood pressure is the term given to the pressure produced by your heart pumping blood to all parts of your body. Your blood pressure is measured by two numbers, e.g. 120/80 mm Hg. The top number measures the pressure while your heart beats and the bottom number measures the pressure in between heart beats.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Normal blood pressure is part of good health. High blood pressure is caused when the blood vessels tighten and the measurement goes above the normal range for your age. There are usually no symptoms of high blood pressure and you will only know you have it if you have had your blood pressure measured.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Although you might feel quite well, if your high blood pressure is not treated, it can damage your heart and kidneys, and in some cases lead to strokes, heart attacks, heart and kidney failure, or blindness High blood pressure can be treated and controlled with medicines such as ‘Cozaar’ . Your doctor may also recommend that you make some changes to your lifestyle to help your high blood pressure, such as losing weight, avoiding alcohol and smoking, and reducing the amount of salt in your diet. Your doctor may also encourage you to take more mild exercise
