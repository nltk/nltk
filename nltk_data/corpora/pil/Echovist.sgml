A guide to using Echovist (galactose)
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
This leaflet gives you some information about Echovist. The doctor in charge will explain the procedure to you before administering the product. Echovist is an echo-contrast medium. Ultrasound is used to examine soft tissue and organs in your body. The video pictures created by the ultrasound machine can be made clearer by the administration of an echo-contrast medium such as Echovist. Once the procedure has been completed a series of pictures can be produced on the video screen which allows the specialist to make a diagnosis.
