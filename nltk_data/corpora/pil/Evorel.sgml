What are Evorel patches used for?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Evorel patches are used for hormone replacement therapy in the treatment of symptoms of the menopause. These may be caused by a lack of naturally occurring oestrogens and progestogens.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>
<DIV type=1>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
What is the menopause?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Women produce oestrogen hormones from their ovaries throughout their adult life. These hormones have many effects, e.g., sexual development and control of the menstrual cycle.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The menopause occurs when a woman's ovaries cease to function and there is a decline in the levels of hormones produced by the ovaries, one of these being oestrogen. This is a gradual process which takes place over a number of years - a time known as the 'change of life'. During this time oestrogen levels fluctuate and decline and it is this which causes symptoms such as hot flushes, night sweats, mood swings and local vaginal symptoms such as dryness and itching and uncomfortable or painful intercourse. Low oestrogen levels also result from surgical removal of the ovaries - this may be done at the same time as a hysterectomy (womb removal). This is described as a surgical menopause and may cause the same symptoms as given above.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>
<DIV type=1>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
How do Evorel patches work?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
The Evorel patch replaces the natural oestrogen that is normally released by the ovaries. It does this by passing the oestrogen from the patch into the body through the skin. The active levels of oestrogen in the body are reached about 4 hours after the patch is applied to the skin and last for 3 to 4 days after which the patch must be changed.

</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>

Special warnings
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
It is important that you have a full and thorough physical and gynaecological examination and that your own and family's medical histories are taken before you start any Hormone Replacement Therapy.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
There is some evidence that HRT may increase the risk of breast cancer in post menopausal women. If you have taken HRT for 5 years you should discuss with your doctor whether you should receive further HRT treatment.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you still have your womb (i.e., have not had a hysterectomy) taking oestrogen alone may increase the risk of overgrowth of the womb lining. You should discuss this with your doctor who may prescribe another hormone progestogen to take with the oestrogen.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
You should receive regular full medical examinations whilst taking Evorel.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you have had a blood clot in the leg or lung, a stroke or a heart attack or are immobile for any reason, such as after an operation, you may still be able to use Evorel patches but your doctor should decide this and check you regularly if you do use it. If this occurs while using Evorel, treatment should be stopped and your doctor contacted immediately.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Evorel patches should not be used by children.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>

</BLOCK>

How should you use Evorel patches?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>

<HEAD ltag="bullet" >
When to use the patch
</HEAD>




<BLOCK>
There is enough hormone in each patch to last for several days but to ensure a steady supply to the body, the patches must be changed at 3 or 4 day intervals. To make it easy to remember when this should be done, keep to the same two days every week. This will mean that one patch is on for three and the other for four days. For example, if you use your first patch on a Monday, it should be changed on Thursday and again on the following Monday.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
You can work out your two days from the following table, starting from the first day of use:

Where to place the Evorel patch
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Most women prefer to wear the patch on the thigh or bottom. 
<EMPH slant = "italic">
It should NEVER be worn on or near the breasts
</EMPH>
. Although it can be worn underneath clothing, it should not be placed under elasticated waistbands.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>

</BLOCK>


</DIV>
<DIV type=1>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
What if the patch falls off?
</HEAD>

Just apply a new patch and keep to your original 'patch change' days. If you have just had a bath or shower, wait until your skin cools before applying a new patch.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
What do you do in the case of an overdosage?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Overdosage with a patch is unlikely. Effects of too much oestrogen can be reversed simply by removal of the patch. Your doctor may decide to change you to a different size of Evorel patch. The most common symptoms of oestrogen overdose are breast tenderness, nausea and irregular bleeding.

<HEAD weight="bold" >
What if I am allergic to the patch?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
As with normal sticking plaster, allergic reactions to the patch are unlikely. However, should you have such a reaction, please consult your doctor.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>
<DIV type=1>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
Does the patch work as a contraceptive?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
NO, the levels of hormone supplied by the Evorel patch are too low for it to do this. Although menopausal women face an ever-decreasing risk of pregnancy, normal precautions should be taken during sexual intercourse. If in doubt, consult your doctor.
