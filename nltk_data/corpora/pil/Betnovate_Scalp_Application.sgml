Betnovate Scalp Application is one of a group of medicines called topical steroids. "Topical" means they are put on the skin. Topical steroids reduce the redness and itchiness of certain skin problems. (They should not be confused with "anabolic" steroids misused by some body builders and taken as tablets or injections).

<BLOCK>
Betnovate Scalp Application also contains an alcohol which has an antiseptic effect.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Ingredients of the slightly gelled liquid include:
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The active ingredient - betamethasone (as valerate) 0.1% in a base containing carbomer and isopropyl alcohol The scalp application does not contain any lanolin, parabens or colouring agents

<BLOCK>
If your doctor has told you in detail HOW MUCH to use and HOW OFTEN then keep to this advice.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you are not sure then follow the advice on the back of this leaflet.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>

</DIV>
<DIV type=1>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
Unless told by your doctor:
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
- YOU SHOULD NOT use more than this.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
- YOU SHOULD NOT use it for a long time (such as nearly every day for many weeks or months).
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Overuse like this may allow the active ingredient to pass through the scalp and affect other parts of the body, especially in infants and children. The use of airtight bandages or dressings over the treated areas increases this risk.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If your scalp problem does not improve in two to four weeks tell your doctor.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If your doctor has prescribed the scalp application for psoriasis you should let your doctor review your progress at regular intervals, as such treatment needs careful supervision.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
