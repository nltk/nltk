'Augmentin' 125/31 SF suspension is for children under six.  The usual dose is one spoonful (5 ml) of medicine three times a day for children between the ages of one and six years.  For children under one, the dose is worked out using the child's weight.  For example, if your child weighed 7.5 kg, they would need 2 ml of the medicine three times a day.  Your doctor will tell you how much medicine your child should take each day.  The doctor's instructions are also on the label of the bottle, so read it carefully.  If you have any questions about 'Augmentin', talk to your doctor or pharmacist.
