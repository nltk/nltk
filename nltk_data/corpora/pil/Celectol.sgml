You don't have to take up a vigorous sport to take exercise. Simply walking briskly (so your body feels like it's working hard) for about thirty minutes 3 or more times a week should be enough. Also use stairs rather than a lift or escalator. Cycling or gentle jogging and swimming are good for you too. Consult your doctor before starting any exercise programme. Remember it is important to start gently and build up slowly so that your body can get used to It.
