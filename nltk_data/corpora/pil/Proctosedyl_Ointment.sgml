How should you use your medicine?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Proctosedyl Ointment should be applied in the morning and at bedtime and, if possible, after every time you empty your bowels. Your doctor will advise you of the correct use for you. After washing your hands, squeeze a small quantity of ointment onto the end of a finger and gently rub a thin layer of ointment over the sore, itching area around the back passage.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If your doctor has asked you to place some ointment inside the back passage, screw the plastic nozzle provided with the 15 and 30 gram packs, onto the tube and then insert the nozzle into your back passage. Squeeze the tube gently while slowly pulling it out of the back passage. Stay still for a minute or two, then unscrew the nozzle from the tube and wash your hands and the nozzle.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The treatment should last for a week. If you are still having problems after this, see your doctor again.
</BLOCK>

<EMPH slant = "italic">
NOTE: Your doctor will advise you of the best way to use your medicine. Always follow this advice about when and how to take your medicine and always read the label on the box/tube. Your pharmacist may also be able to help you if you are not sure.
