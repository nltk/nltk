Kenyans protest tax hikes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">NAIROBI<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Kenya<e_enamex> (<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">AP<e_enamex>) _ <b_numex type="CARDINAL">Thousands<e_numex> of laborers, students and
opposition politicians on <b_timex type="DATE">Saturday<e_timex> protested tax hikes imposed by
their cash-strapped government, which they accused of failing to
provide basic services.
	   Beneath a scorching sun, they sang anti-government songs and
chanted ``<b_enamex type="PERSON">Moi<e_enamex> must go,'' showing their derision for President
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Daniel arap Moi<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Kenya<e_enamex>'s ruler for <b_timex type="DURATION">20 years<e_timex>.
	   By voice vote, the <b_numex type="CARDINAL">5,000<e_numex> protesters approved a resolution
calling for the government to scrap new taxes, convene a convention
to write a new Constitution, stop harassing students and street
vendors, and halt ethnic violence.
	   If the government doesn't respond to the demands, workers should
go on strike <b_timex type="DATE">April 3<e_timex>, said <b_enamex type="PERSON">Kivutha Kibwana<e_enamex>, of the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">National
Convention Assembly<e_enamex>, a group of opposition political, church and
civic leaders who organized the rally.
	   Although the crowd cheered its support, the assembly's calls for
general strikes have failed in the past.
	   Kenyans are most angered by tax increases announced earlier this
month to plug a widening budget deficit.
	   The price of gas and diesel went up, and tax deductions were
revoked on gifts to charities and nonprofit organizations. Faced
with a strike by bank workers, <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION" status="opt">Finance<e_enamex> Minister <b_enamex type="PERSON">Simeon Nyachae<e_enamex>
delayed plans to raise taxes on cut-rate loans provided by
employers.
	   Several politicians have charged that the high taxes Kenyans
already pay go into the pockets of government officials or wasteful
projects, and not into providing essential services and repairing
crumbling infrastructure.
	   ``I would like <b_enamex type="PERSON">Moi<e_enamex> to explain and bring back the money he has
stolen,'' said <b_enamex type="PERSON">Kenneth Matiba<e_enamex>, who ran second to <b_enamex type="PERSON">Moi<e_enamex> in the <b_timex type="DATE">1992<e_timex>
election.
	   The <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">International Monetary Fund<e_enamex> has demanded spending cuts and
tax hikes, warning that in the absence of corrective measures,
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Kenya<e_enamex>'s overall budget deficit for <b_timex type="DATE">1997<e_timex>-<b_timex type="DATE">98<e_timex> will reach <b_numex type="PERCENT">3.9 percent<e_numex>
of the gross domestic product _ more than double the goal of <b_numex type="PERCENT">1.7
percent<e_numex>.
	   The <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">IMF<e_enamex> last year withheld a <b_numex type="MONEY">dlrs 220 million<e_numex> loan from <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Kenya<e_enamex>,
citing official corruption and mismanagement.
	   In contrast to other rallies which have drawn mostly male
students, <b_timex type="DATE">Saturday<e_timex>'s rally also attracted laborers, businessmen and
women.
	   They demonstrated at the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Kamukunji Grounds<e_enamex>, a grassy field in
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Nairobi<e_enamex> where Kenyans have often gathered to show their
dissatisfaction with the government.
	   ``We, the people of <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Kenya<e_enamex>, have met here several times. We have
been beaten, we have shed blood, we have purchased the right to
meet here today with our blood,'' said <b_enamex type="PERSON">John Munuve<e_enamex>, an assembly
leader.
	   The protest was peaceful, and no police were deployed.
	   In <b_timex type="DATE">July<e_timex>, police killed more than a <b_numex type="CARDINAL">dozen<e_numex> demonstrators pressing
for constitutional reforms before elections in <b_timex type="DATE">December<e_timex>, in which
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Moi<e_enamex> won a fifth, <b_timex type="DURATION">five-year<e_timex> term.

Long-awaited <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Vatican<e_enamex> statement on Holocaust ready
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">VATICAN CITY<e_enamex> (<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">AP<e_enamex>) _ More than <b_timex type="DURATION">10 years<e_timex> after it was promised in
a meeting with Jewish leaders, a major <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Vatican<e_enamex> document on the
Holocaust is ready.
	   The <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Vatican<e_enamex> said <b_timex type="DATE">Saturday<e_timex> the document would be made public on
<b_timex type="DATE">Monday<e_timex>.
	   Jewish groups have been keenly awaiting the document to see if
it will continue to heal Jewish-Catholic relations.
	   The last <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Vatican<e_enamex> document of landmark proportions on Jewish
relations was a <b_timex type="DATE">1965<e_timex> statement that came out of the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Second Vatican
Council<e_enamex> under <b_enamex type="PERSON">Paul VI<e_enamex>. ``Nostra Aetate'' (In Our Times) condemned
anti-Semitism and said the Jews cannot be collectively blamed for
the crucifixion of <b_enamex type="PERSON">Jesus<e_enamex>.
	   Pope <b_enamex type="PERSON">John Paul II<e_enamex> has dedicated much of his nearly <b_numex type="MEASURE">20-year<e_numex>-old
papacy to improving relations of the church with Jews, whom he
refers to as ``older brothers,'' after centuries of animosity.
	   Word of the latest document first came on <b_timex type="DATE">Sept. 1, 1987<e_timex>, during
a meeting between the pope and Jewish leaders in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Castel Gandolfo<e_enamex>,
the pontiff's <b_timex type="DATE">summer<e_timex> residence in the hills southeast of <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Rome<e_enamex>.
	   The unprecedented meeting was hurriedly called as anxiety built
in the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Vatican<e_enamex> that Jews might boycott a ceremony during the then
soon-approaching papal visit to the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">United States<e_enamex>. Jews were
angered by the pope's audience earlier that year with then Austrian
President <b_enamex type="PERSON">Kurt Waldheim<e_enamex>, who was been accused of helping deport
Jews to <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Nazi<e_enamex> concentration camps, allegations he denied.
	   The <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Castel Gandolfo<e_enamex> meeting was the first time Jewish
representatives had sat down for informal discussions with a pope.
	   Representatives at the <b_timex type="DATE">1987<e_timex> meeting said the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Vatican<e_enamex> planned to
publish a major document dealing with anti-Semitism and the
genocide of European Jews by the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Nazis<e_enamex> in World War II.
	   Since that meeting, <b_enamex type="PERSON">John Paul<e_enamex> has presided over several
milestones that improved relations with Jews, including the
establishment of diplomatic relations with <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Israel<e_enamex> in <b_timex type="DATE">1995<e_timex>.
	   Another ground-breaking step was the pope's visit to <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Rome<e_enamex>'s main
synagogue in <b_timex type="DATE">1986<e_timex>.
	   Last <b_timex type="DATE">fall<e_timex>, the pope told a <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Vatican<e_enamex> seminar on anti-Jewish
currents in Christian theology that centuries of anti-Jewish
prejudice had figured in ``deadening'' Christian resistance toe the
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Nazi<e_enamex> persecution of Jews. But, to the disappointment of some Jewish
groups, the pope steered clear of blaming the church itself.

Elaborate Laces and Belle Epoque for <b_enamex type="PERSON">Christian Lacroix<e_enamex>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">PARIS<e_enamex> (<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">AP<e_enamex>) - <b_enamex type="PERSON">Christian Lacroix<e_enamex> took his big audience on a
time-warp rollercoaster ride at his <b_timex type="DATE">Saturday<e_timex> show in the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Louvre<e_enamex>'s
Carrousel area.
	   It started out looking vaguely back to the <b_timex type="DATE">1940s<e_timex> with some
``<b_enamex type="PERSON" status="opt">Evita<e_enamex>'' hairdos, short flared skirts, a few sharply-tailored
shoulders in day wear. But then, there was not much day wear, and
clothes soon went into Belle Epoque evenings, via a modern ``star
trek'' of fabulous pearled fabrics.
	   Minimalism, so fashionable on international runways these days,
just does not grab <b_enamex type="PERSON">Christian Lacroix<e_enamex>.
	   ``After <b_timex type="DURATION">ten years<e_timex>, we must find a balance between glamour and
efficiency,'' said <b_enamex type="PERSON">Jean-Jacques Picart<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Lacroix<e_enamex>'s partner on the
business side, though the house is under the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">LVMH<e_enamex> (<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Louis Vuitton
Moet Hennesy<e_enamex>) umbrella.
	   The glamour will undoubtedly not die out.
	   There were few clothes for day wear in this dressy collection
that tended to the too-fussy, as <b_enamex type="PERSON">Lacroix<e_enamex> often does. What to make
of a trouser suit with its tweedy masculine trousers and ruffled
lace-organza Victorian blouse?
	   Or the very tight sequin-spattered knit dress with its faux mink
appliques and high feathered hat? And with the spangled tights
shown with all the short clothes, the show often teetered between
the boulevard hooker territory and the disco.
	   But there were many wonderful moments here, including an
excellent short carmine moire silk coat tied at the waist over a
sky-blue lace knit dress.
	   Big fur collars and long tweed coats, the gold-black
tiger-striped lame trapeze coat, some of the great frock coats, and
a remarkable tie-dye effect silk in skirts and floppy <b_timex type="DATE">1930s<e_timex> pants,
looked like winners.
	   Sharply-fitted evening suits with pants had large, structured
shoulders. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Lacroix<e_enamex> has evolved quite far away from his famous shawl
and sloped shoulder looks of opening days over <b_timex type="DURATION">10 years<e_timex> ago.
	   The most modern-looking clothes were simply-cut soft gowns and
trouser outfits in black, gray and white pearled and diamante
fabrics with a <b_enamex type="LOCATION">milky way<e_enamex> effect.
	   And the party scene was complete in the Victorians or southern
belle evening styles capped by a fabulous red velvet gown with
crinolines and decollete a la <b_enamex type="PERSON">Scarlet O'Hara<e_enamex>, draped like curtains
and topped by a little red topper riding hat.
	   Earlier, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Jean-Paul Gaultier<e_enamex> went yet again to the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Arctic Circle<e_enamex>
for inspiration - as he did some years ago - but <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex> night's
offering was brilliant.
	   The atmosphere was hot and smoky, a bar scene created in the
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION" status="opt">Wagram dance hall<e_enamex>, notorious for the ``Last Tango in Paris.''
	   But the models, including <b_enamex type="PERSON">Naomi Campbell<e_enamex>, were dressed up like
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Nanook of the North<e_enamex> as they cavorted, smoked, drank champagne and
kibitzed with the audience at the bar.
	   There were many of those Siberian hats with flaps, fur, even
sequins at the end, and the parkas were very good-looking, many
quite tailored, in black and white.
	   Some of the impressions were of hippies from outer space, but in
spite of some crazy combinations like a layered look with long
ethnic skirt, fringed tunic and striped blazer, there was much to
admire.
	   The folklore Nordic knits were handsome, in sweaters, or
knee-length pants, and might have been topped by something like a
super taffeta full coat.
	   An excellent full gray knit sleeveless tunic with its straight
white pants was another winner. A double-faced gray coat with its
trouser suit was impeccable.
	   For evening wear at the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">North Pole<e_enamex>, girls could dress up in
handsome Nordic sweaters and full iridescent taffeta skirts, or top
one of the full striped skirts with a terrific short beige trench
coat.
	   ``I loved the show,'' said eminent English fashion historian
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Colin McDowell<e_enamex>. ``It was indeed <b_enamex type="PERSON">Nanook of the North<e_enamex> - with a trace
of existentialism.''

In troubled Yugoslav province, Serbs, too, are victims
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">PRISTINA<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Yugoslavia<e_enamex> (<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">AP<e_enamex>) _ He's a company director who wears
the best suits, collects fine art and counts the influential among
his friends. She's a worn-out refugee who sleeps under a borrowed
blanket.
	   Elsewhere, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Boban Boskovic<e_enamex>, chief executive of the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Plastika<e_enamex>
factory, would have nothing in common with <b_enamex type="PERSON">Ilinka Durbaba<e_enamex>, stuck in
a refugee camp for nearly <b_timex type="DURATION">three years<e_timex>. In <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Kosovo<e_enamex>, they shoulder a
common burden.
	   They are Serbs in a part of <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Serbia<e_enamex> controlled by a hostile
Albanian majority that outnumbers them <b_numex type="CARDINAL">9<e_numex> to <b_numex type="CARDINAL">1<e_numex>. And while the
Albanians groan under repressive Serbian rule, the average Serb in
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Kosovo<e_enamex> feels threatened by the specter of a secessionist war.
	   The <b_enamex type="LOCATION">United States<e_enamex> and other world powers consider the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Kosovo<e_enamex>
Albanians victims, and back their struggle for autonomy, if not for
independence.
	   The Albanians lost the right to virtual self-rule in <b_timex type="DATE">1989<e_timex>. Most
recently, Serb police killed at least <b_numex type="CARDINAL">80<e_numex> of them in a brutal
<b_timex type="DURATION">two-week<e_timex> crackdown on militant separatists.
	   As sympathy grows for the Albanians, hostility rises against
Serbs, who often are equated with their repressive government.
	   But in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Kosovo<e_enamex>, Serbs, too, are victims.
	   Most work at low-paying government jobs or state companies that
often cannot meet payroll. Albanians, victims of mass firings in
the early <b_timex type="DATE">1990s<e_timex>, now dominate the private sector, their prosperity
reflected in large houses and modern stores.
	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Kosovo<e_enamex> Serbs are a despised minority on home ground. But they
cannot leave _ to keep them there, the government has forbidden
property sales.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Milica Boskovic<e_enamex>, the director's wife, flinches when an Albanian
boy spits at her.
	   ``This isn't the worst of it,'' she says. Other Serb parents
nod. They walk their children to school, fearful of abuse from
Albanian kids. The school is split by a wall _ <b_numex type="CARDINAL">one<e_numex> side for Serbs,
the other for Albanians.
	   ``Their kids swear at our kids,'' says Mrs. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Boskovic<e_enamex>, mother of
<b_numex type="MEASURE">7<e_numex>- and <b_numex type="MEASURE">8-year<e_numex> old boys.
	   At the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Plastika<e_enamex> factory, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Boban Boskovic<e_enamex> says he does what he can
for harmony _ <b_numex type="CARDINAL">half<e_numex> his work force is ethnic Albanian.
	   Loyalties were forged after the plant burned down in <b_timex type="DATE">1983<e_timex>, <b_numex type="CARDINAL">one<e_numex>
of several fires thought set by Albanian separatists. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Boskovic<e_enamex>
called a workers' meeting ahead of rebuilding.
	   ``I told them, `Here, I am your <b_enamex type="PERSON">Tito<e_enamex>, your <b_enamex type="PERSON">Milosevic<e_enamex>, your
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Rugova<e_enamex>,''' said <b_enamex type="PERSON">Boskovic<e_enamex>, referring respectively to the leader of
the former communist <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Yugoslavia<e_enamex>, who gave <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Kosovo<e_enamex> automony; his
successor who took it away, and the ethnic Albanian leader now
seeking independence. ``You've all got mouths to feed, whether they
are Serb or Albanian.''
	   Born and raised in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Kosovo<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Boskovic<e_enamex> is proud of his roots in the
province, the cradle of Serb culture and Orthodox religion.
	   Pictures in his lavish office show him with archbishops, Serb
royalty _ and <b_enamex type="PERSON">Zeljko Raznatovic<e_enamex>, a.k.a <b_enamex type="PERSON">Arkan<e_enamex>, the Serb
ultranationalist whose troops are accused of atrocities in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Croatia<e_enamex>,
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Bosnia<e_enamex>, and, most recently, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Kosovo<e_enamex>.
	   ``Where would I go?'' he replies, when asked if he is
contemplating leaving.
	   ``We must talk to them,'' he says of the Albanians. ``We should
have talked to them a long time ago.''
	   At the hairdresser's, Serb women discuss options. Stay or go?
	   They reflect on their good times in the <b_timex type="DATE">1950s<e_timex> and <b_timex type="DATE">1960s<e_timex>, and
what they view as <b_enamex type="PERSON">Tito<e_enamex>'s greatest mistake _ giving <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Kosovo<e_enamex> autonomy
in <b_timex type="DATE">1974<e_timex>. That, a high Albanian birthrate and an influx from
neighboring <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Albania<e_enamex> left the Serbs cornered by the <b_timex type="DATE">1980s<e_timex>.
	   ``We had everything,'' says <b_enamex type="PERSON">Zhivka Savic<e_enamex>, <b_numex type="MEASURE">65<e_numex>. ``They had
nothing.''
	   The reverse seems true now. The <b_numex type="MEASURE">two-chair<e_numex> salon is squeezed
among modern, well-equipped Albanian shops.
	   ``Compare my little house to a <b_numex type="MEASURE">six-story<e_numex> Albanian one,'' Mrs.
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Savic<e_enamex> rails, ignoring warnings from other women to hush because of
the thin wall and the Albanian shop next door. ``Sell to an
Albanian? In a <b_timex type="DURATION">minute<e_timex>, if they let us.''
	   ``In my street, ... Albanian kids have started chanting `we are
the terrorists.''
	   Hairdresser <b_enamex type="PERSON">Milanka Milentijevic<e_enamex> says <b_numex type="PERCENT">80 percent<e_numex> of her
customers were Albanians in the <b_timex type="DATE">1970s<e_timex>.
	   ``Now, I have <b_numex type="MEASURE">one a month<e_numex>. Business is down <b_numex type="PERCENT">95 percent<e_numex>,'' she
says. ``Even the Serbs who could afford to come left a long time
ago.''
	   About <b_numex type="CARDINAL">200<e_numex> of her relatives have left the area, but Mrs.
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Milentijevic<e_enamex> wants to stay _ for now. She describes Albanian
acquaintances as ``friends in hiding.''
	   ``We talk about everything. Families, politics,'' says Mrs.
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Milentijevic<e_enamex>, <b_numex type="MEASURE">50<e_numex>. ``Sometimes we even joke about the situation.''
	   Mrs. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Durbaba<e_enamex>, the refugee, contemplates her options. Sitting on
a cot in a space blanketed off from the next family, she says she
started running at <b_numex type="MEASURE">3<e_numex>, from the Germans during World War II. In
<b_timex type="DATE">1995<e_timex>, she fled her town of <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Knin<e_enamex> in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Croatia<e_enamex>, when Croats recaptured
it from rebel Serbs, who had seized it in <b_timex type="DATE">1991<e_timex>.
	   Is it time to run again?
	   ``I have nowhere to go,'' she says, sobbing.
	   She turns to a poster of <b_enamex type="PERSON">Slobodan Milosevic<e_enamex>, the Yugoslav
president. He stoked the war that forced her to flee <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Knin<e_enamex> and his
decision to abolish <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Kosovo<e_enamex>'s autonomy radicalized the Albanians.
	   ``I love him,'' says Mrs. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Durbaba<e_enamex>. ``He's good for everybody who
loves peace.''

Long-awaited <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Vatican<e_enamex> statement on Holocaust ready
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">VATICAN CITY<e_enamex> (<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">AP<e_enamex>) _ More than <b_timex type="DURATION">10 years<e_timex> after it was promised in
a meeting with Jewish leaders, a major <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Vatican<e_enamex> document on the
Holocaust is ready.
	   The <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Vatican<e_enamex> said <b_timex type="DATE">Saturday<e_timex> that the document, produced by the
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Commission for Relations with Judaism<e_enamex>, would be made public on
<b_timex type="DATE">Monday<e_timex>.
	   Jewish groups worldwide have been keenly awaiting the document
to see if it will continue to heal Jewish-Catholic relations and
have at times issued calls for its release to be speeded up.
	   The last <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Vatican<e_enamex> document of landmark proportions on Jewish
relations was a <b_timex type="DATE">1965<e_timex> statement that came out of the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Second Vatican
Council<e_enamex> under <b_enamex type="PERSON">Paul VI<e_enamex>. ``Nostra Aetate'' (In Our Times) condemned
anti-Semitism and said the Jews cannot be collectively blamed for
the crucifixion of <b_enamex type="PERSON">Jesus<e_enamex>.
	   Pope <b_enamex type="PERSON">John Paul II<e_enamex> has dedicated much of his nearly <b_numex type="MEASURE">20-year<e_numex>-old
papacy to improving relations of the church with Jews, whom he
refers to as ``older brothers,'' after centuries of animosity.
	   Word of the latest document first came on <b_timex type="DATE">Sept. 1, 1987<e_timex>, during
a meeting between the pope and Jewish leaders in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Castel Gandolfo<e_enamex>,
the pontiff's <b_timex type="DATE">summer<e_timex> residence in the hills southeast of <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Rome<e_enamex>.
	   The unprecedented meeting was hurriedly called as anxiety built
in the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Vatican<e_enamex> that Jews might boycott a ceremony during the then
soon-approaching papal visit to the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">United States<e_enamex>. Jews were
angered by the pope's audience earlier that year with then Austrian
President <b_enamex type="PERSON">Kurt Waldheim<e_enamex>, who was been accused of helping deport
Jews to <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Nazi<e_enamex> concentration camps, allegations he denied.
	   The <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Castel Gandolfo<e_enamex> meeting was the first time Jewish
representatives had sat down for informal discussions with a pope.
	   Representatives at the <b_timex type="DATE">1987<e_timex> meeting said the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Vatican<e_enamex> planned to
publish a major document dealing with anti-Semitism and the
genocide of European Jews by the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Nazis<e_enamex> in World War II.
	   Since that meeting, <b_enamex type="PERSON">John Paul<e_enamex> has presided over several
milestones that improved relations with Jews, including the
establishment of diplomatic relations with <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Israel<e_enamex> in <b_timex type="DATE">1995<e_timex>. The
agreement to go ahead and forge ties came in <b_timex type="DATE">December 1993<e_timex>.
	   Another ground-breaking step was the pope's visit to <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Rome<e_enamex>'s main
synagogue in <b_timex type="DATE">1986<e_timex>.
	   Last <b_timex type="DATE">fall<e_timex>, the pope told a <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Vatican<e_enamex> seminar on anti-Jewish
currents in Christian theology that centuries of anti-Jewish
prejudice had figured in ``deadening'' Christian resistance toe the
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Nazi<e_enamex> persecution of Jews. But, to the disappointment of some Jewish
groups, the pope steered clear of blaming the church itself.

Underground political party has big dreams for <b_enamex type="LOCATION">China<e_enamex>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">BEIJING<e_enamex> (<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">AP<e_enamex>) _ A small and secretive Chinese opposition party
has ambitious goals: bringing free elections, political democracy
and greater civil liberties than currently allowed by the ruling
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Communist Party<e_enamex>, a <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Beijing<e_enamex>-based member of the underground group
says.
	   The <b_numex type="MEASURE">29-year<e_numex>-old member of the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">China Democratic Justice Party<e_enamex>
stopped short of saying that they want to see the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">communists<e_enamex>
overthrown. Instead, he said they wanted to be able to compete on
an equal footing with them in elections and ``let the people decide
who rules.''
	   ``When we unite, we won't just be a <b_numex type="CARDINAL">few hundred<e_numex> or a <b_numex type="CARDINAL">few
thousand<e_numex> people. We'll be able to grow into <b_numex type="CARDINAL">several million<e_numex> people,
<b_numex type="CARDINAL">several tens of million<e_numex>,'' he said in an interview, the first by a
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">China<e_enamex>-based member of the group.
	   ``We'll be like the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION" alt="Solidarity">Polish Solidarity union movement<e_enamex>, a
nationwide civil power.''
	   The organization announced its formation last month in faxes to
foreign reporters in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Beijing<e_enamex>. It said it was headquartered with
exiled Chinese dissidents in the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">United States<e_enamex> and had members in
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">China<e_enamex>. Until now, however, there had been no way of confirming the
group's existence with members inside <b_enamex type="LOCATION">China<e_enamex>.
	   The group is the first known opposition party organized by
dissidents in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">China<e_enamex> and overseas. But, forced to operate secretly
in small cells, it does not for the moment appear to present any
obvious threat to the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">communists<e_enamex>' nearly <b_timex type="DURATION">50-year<e_timex> rule.
	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">China<e_enamex>'s constitution allows for freedom of association and other
liberties. But working to change the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">communist<e_enamex>-run system is
illegal, and the party relentlessly punishes dissent.
	   Thus, party members in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">China<e_enamex> work in small cells that operate
independently of each other to avoid detection, the party member
said.
	   He identified himself as <b_enamex type="PERSON">Chen Jin<e_enamex>, a pseudonym he said he has
used when signing petitions to the government calling for
democratic change.
	   He was generally circumspect about his own history. He said he
grew up in northeast <b_enamex type="LOCATION">China<e_enamex>, studied in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Beijing<e_enamex>, where he works as a
business manager, and took part in democracy protests in <b_timex type="DATE">1989<e_timex> that
started on <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Beijing<e_enamex>'s <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Tiananmen Square<e_enamex> and spread to other cities.
	   He said there were <b_numex type="CARDINAL">17<e_numex> members in his party cell, <b_numex type="CARDINAL">one<e_numex> of <b_numex type="CARDINAL">three<e_numex> in
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Beijing<e_enamex>. The other members range in age and include university
students, government bureaucrats, professors, <b_numex type="CARDINAL">two<e_numex> laborers and a
lawyer, he said.
	   He estimated the <b_numex type="CARDINAL">two<e_numex> other cells in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Beijing<e_enamex> have a similar
number of members. Another cell operates in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Changchun<e_enamex> and another
is planned in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Harbin<e_enamex>, he said.
	   Both cities are in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">China<e_enamex>'s northeast, where dissatisfaction over
layoffs at run-down state firms is mounting.
	   According to <b_enamex type="LOCATION">New York<e_enamex>-based dissident <b_enamex type="PERSON">Fu Shenqi<e_enamex>, a spokesman for
the group, the party has at least <b_numex type="CARDINAL">100<e_numex> members in <b_numex type="CARDINAL">five<e_numex> to <b_numex type="CARDINAL">10<e_numex>
branches in provinces and cities across <b_enamex type="LOCATION">China<e_enamex>.
	   The party's demands include freedom of speech, freedom of
assembly, freedom to protest, freedom of the press, and freedom to
set up opposition parties, the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Beijing<e_enamex>-based member said.
	   ``We all have a common conviction _ bringing political
diversification and political democracy to <b_enamex type="LOCATION">China<e_enamex>,'' he said.
	   Asked how the party would recruit members, he described a
somewhat vague process whereby party members would start by
chatting to ordinary Chinese _ he mentioned taxi drivers, factory
workers, entrepreneurs and soldiers _ about issues of public
concern.
	   These could include official corruption within the party and
government, layoffs, or other sources of dissatisfaction that have
arisen in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">China<e_enamex>'s <b_timex type="DURATION">two-decade<e_timex> shift from a planned to a market
economy.
	   Through such contacts they would look for suitable people to
join the party, he said.
	   ``If after <b_numex type="CARDINAL">one<e_numex> meeting, <b_numex type="CARDINAL">two<e_numex> meetings, many meetings, we discover
that they think like us and are willing to operate in an
organization, then they will become a target for us,'' he said.
	   ``When we are strong, the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Communist Party<e_enamex> will have lost its
ruling base, the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">army<e_enamex> won't carry out its orders,'' he added. ``At
that time, we'll use negotiations to resolve the problems in
society.''

Questions linger <b_timex type="DURATION">two decades<e_timex> after assassination in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Italy<e_enamex>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">ROME<e_enamex> (<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">AP<e_enamex>) _ <b_timex type="DURATION">Twenty years<e_timex> after terrorists kidnapped former
Premier <b_enamex type="PERSON">Aldo Moro<e_enamex> and left his bullet-riddled body in the back of a
parked car, <b_numex type="CARDINAL">one<e_numex> question still haunts <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Italy<e_enamex>: Could he have been
saved?
	   The anniversary of the kidnapping is being marked by television
programs, new books, a play and published interviews with convicted
members of the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Red Brigades<e_enamex> who took part in the crime.
	   But the ex-terrorists have only added fuel to the debate about
the assassination, which became the defining moment in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Italy<e_enamex>'s
reign of terrorism in the <b_timex type="DATE">1970s<e_timex> and early <b_timex type="DATE">80s<e_timex>.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Moro<e_enamex> was abducted in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Rome<e_enamex> on <b_timex type="DATE">March 16, 1978<e_timex>, in an ambush that
killed <b_numex type="CARDINAL">five<e_numex> of his bodyguards. His body turned up <b_timex type="DURATION">55 days<e_timex> later in
a car parked around the corner from the headquarters of both the
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Christian Democrat<e_enamex> and <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Communist<e_enamex> parties.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Moro<e_enamex> had just negotiated an agreement for the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Communists<e_enamex> and
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Christian Democrats<e_enamex>, the leading political forces in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Italy<e_enamex> at that
time, to collaborate.
	   It was a historic agreement, a break with the long-standing
policy backed by the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">United States<e_enamex> to keep <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Western Europe<e_enamex>'s largest
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">communist<e_enamex> party away from power.
	   Those political parties no longer exist, done in by scandals and
an end to the Cold War that also took the bite out of the
ideological divisions that so marked Italian society during the
years of bullets and bombs.
	   The kidnapping and slaying stiffened <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Italy<e_enamex>'s resolve to fight
domestic terrorism, marking the beginning of the end to urban
guerrilla gangs in the country.
	   Then-premier <b_enamex type="PERSON">Giulio Andreotti<e_enamex>, like <b_enamex type="PERSON">Moro<e_enamex> a <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Christian Democrat<e_enamex>
and now on trial on charges of favoring the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">mafia<e_enamex>, insisted earlier
this month that the government did everything it could.
	   ``To free <b_enamex type="PERSON">Moro<e_enamex>, we activated everybody, including the armed
forces,'' <b_enamex type="PERSON">Andreotti<e_enamex> said in a roundtable organized by the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Corriere
della Sera<e_enamex> newspaper.
	   The government stuck to hard-line policy, refusing any
compromise, such as freeing terrorist prisoners despite <b_enamex type="PERSON">Moro<e_enamex>'s
increasingly desperate pleas.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Mario Moretti<e_enamex>, convicted as the triggerman, was quoted as saying
that ``just a signal, the recognition of the existence of political
prisoners'' would have been enough.
	   ``Instead, no one knew the right thing to do and we made a
mistake. We all made a mistake,'' he was quoted as saying by the
weekly <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Vita<e_enamex>.
	   But <b_enamex type="PERSON">Anna Braghetti<e_enamex>, another former <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Red Brigade<e_enamex> member, gave a
different version, saying the decision to kill <b_enamex type="PERSON">Moro<e_enamex> came after a
poll among <b_numex type="CARDINAL">200<e_numex> members of the gang.
	   The group could not justify sparing <b_enamex type="PERSON">Moro<e_enamex>'s life, given that the
government was not compromising and so many of his bodyguards were
killed in an attempt to kidnap him, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Braghetti<e_enamex> was quoted as saying
by <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Corriere della Sera<e_enamex>.
	   Attempts to close the dark chapter of the ``years of lead'' _ as
the terrorist period is called _ by an amnesty for those convicted
of terrorist crimes have been stalled in parliament. Opposition is
strong to clemency for ``blood crimes'' like the <b_enamex type="PERSON">Moro<e_enamex> killing.

	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">BEIRUT<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Lebanon<e_enamex> (<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">AP<e_enamex>) _ Lebanese guerrillas attacked Israeli
forces in southern <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Lebanon<e_enamex> on <b_timex type="DATE">Saturday<e_timex> while civilians flocked to
rallies around the country to mark <b_timex type="DURATION">20 years<e_timex> of Israeli occupation.
	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Lebanon<e_enamex>'s president, prime minister and national assembly
speaker held talks with Syrian leaders in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Damascus<e_enamex> on <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Israel<e_enamex>'s
proposal to withdraw its <b_numex type="CARDINAL">1,500<e_numex> troops from southern <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Lebanon<e_enamex>.
	   The talks were seen as aimed at coordinating the Lebanese and
Syrian views ahead of a visit by <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">U.N.<e_enamex> Secretary General <b_enamex type="PERSON">Kofi Annan<e_enamex>.
Both <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Beirut<e_enamex> and <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Damascus<e_enamex> have already rejected <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Jerusalem<e_enamex>'s
proposal, which makes a withdrawal conditional on Lebanese
guarantees that guerrillas would not attack northern <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Israel<e_enamex>.
	   Guerrillas of the Iranian-backed <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Hezbollah<e_enamex> group mounted attacks
on positions of Israeli troops and their allied Lebanese militiamen
in the occupied zone, Lebanese officials said. There was no word on
casualties.
	   <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Hezbollah<e_enamex> and the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Hezbollah<e_enamex>-backed <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Lebanese Resistance Brigades<e_enamex>
said in statements issued here that their guerrillas had attacked
positions at <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Sojod<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Hardon<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Baarchit<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Hadatha<e_enamex> and <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Soweida<e_enamex>.
	   <b_numex type="CARDINAL">Thousands<e_numex> turned out for rallies in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Beirut<e_enamex>, and the cities of
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Sidon<e_enamex> and <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Tyre<e_enamex> and the town of <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Nabatiyeh<e_enamex> in the south.
	   In <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Sidon<e_enamex>, the capital of southern <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Lebanon<e_enamex>, local politicians
such as the prime minister's sister, legislator <b_enamex type="PERSON">Bahia Hariri<e_enamex>,
denounced <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Israel<e_enamex>'s occupation and called for the implementation of
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">U.N. Security Council<e_enamex> Resolution 425. Passed in <b_timex type="DATE">1978<e_timex>, the
resolution calls on <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Israel<e_enamex> to withdraw its forces from <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Lebanon<e_enamex>.
	   Speakers vowed that guerrillas would continue their
``resistance'' against Israeli forces until the occupation ended.
	   In <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Beirut<e_enamex>, legislator <b_enamex type="PERSON">Mohammed Beydoun<e_enamex>, warned the crowd that
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Israel<e_enamex> might attack <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Lebanon<e_enamex> again ``with the aim of torpedoing
resolution 425.''
	   A group calling itself the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">March 14 Solidarity Day with Occupied
Southern Lebanon<e_enamex> published a full-page advertisement in <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">The Daily
Star<e_enamex> which described the world's failure to make <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Israel<e_enamex> comply with
resolution 425 as a ``record of disgrace.''
	   It was on <b_timex type="DATE">March 14, 1978<e_timex>, that some <b_numex type="CARDINAL">25,000<e_numex> Israeli troops
invaded south <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Lebanon<e_enamex> in a campaign against Palestinian guerrillas,
who had attacked a town in northern <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Israel<e_enamex>. <b_timex type="DURATION">Five days<e_timex> later, the
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Security Council<e_enamex> adopted Resolution 425.
	   Huge yellow banners hung across intersections in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Beirut<e_enamex> where
motorists strung yellow ribbons from their aerials. In <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Lebanon<e_enamex>,
yellow is the symbol of support for resolution 425.
	   In the eastern city of <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Baalbek<e_enamex>, government buildings sported
yellow banners and <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Hezbollah<e_enamex> supporters roamed the streets
soliciting funds for ``the resistance.'' Outside the city,
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Hezbollah<e_enamex> activists burned <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Israel<e_enamex>'s flag on the main road.
	   <b_numex type="CARDINAL">Thousands<e_numex> of Lebanese civilians and militants and nearly <b_numex type="CARDINAL">900<e_numex>
Israeli soldiers have been killed since <b_timex type="DATE">1978<e_timex>. Since <b_timex type="DATE">1985<e_timex> <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Israel<e_enamex> has
occupied a strip of land along the border amounting to <b_numex type="PERCENT">10 percent<e_numex>
of Lebanese territory.
	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Israel<e_enamex>, which maintains the strip with some <b_numex type="CARDINAL">2,500<e_numex> local
militiamen, says the zone is a necessary buffer against guerrilla
attacks. But increasing casualties _ a record <b_numex type="CARDINAL">39<e_numex> Israeli troops
were killed in action in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Lebanon<e_enamex> last <b_timex type="DURATION">year<e_timex> _ have generated
grassroots pressure among Israelis for the government to make a
unilateral withdrawal.

Man seriously hurt in blast in northern <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Israel<e_enamex>

	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">JERUSALEM<e_enamex> (<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">AP<e_enamex>) _ A man was seriously injured <b_timex type="DATE">Saturday<e_timex> in an
explosion outside the bus station in the small northern Israeli
town of <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Afula<e_enamex>, an ambulance official said.
	   The blast blew off both the man's hands, Israeli <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">army<e_enamex> radio
quoted <b_enamex type="PERSON">Eli Bin<e_enamex>, deputy head of the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Afula<e_enamex> ambulance station, as
saying. The man appeared to be in his early <b_numex type="MEASURE">50s<e_numex>, the radio said.
	   Police said the explosion took place in a public park just
outside the bus station.
	   Before the man was taken into surgery, he said he had spotted a
cardboard box that he thought looked suspicious and was examining
it when it exploded, <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">army<e_enamex> radio said.
	   Israeli police frequently tell people to be on the alert for
suspicious objects that might be bombs planted by Palestinian
militant groups. However, police always urge the public not to
touch any such objects, but to report them to the nearest police
station.
	   The <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Afula<e_enamex> bus station was the scene of a major terror attack in
<b_timex type="DATE">April 1994<e_timex>, when a car rigged with explosives blew up, killing <b_numex type="CARDINAL">nine<e_numex>
people and injuring <b_numex type="CARDINAL">45<e_numex>. The militant Muslim group <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Hamas<e_enamex> claimed
responsibility.
	   When <b_timex type="DATE">Saturday<e_timex>'s blast occurred, however, the bus station was
nearly deserted. There is no public transport in most Israeli
cities on the <b_timex type="DATE" alt="Sabbath">Jewish Sabbath<e_timex>, which begins at <b_timex type="TIME">sundown<e_timex> <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex> and
ends at <b_timex type="TIME">sundown<e_timex> on <b_timex type="DATE">Saturday<e_timex>.
