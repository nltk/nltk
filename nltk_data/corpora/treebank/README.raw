			README file for "raw" files

This directory contains the "raw" version of the datafiles found in the
other directories of this release.  The files are plain text, generally
with one sentence per line and blank lines between paragraphs (with some
errors in the automatic process that decided what makes a Sentence).

We are including all of the raw texts from the first 25 of our WSJ
directories; in general, there is always a corresponding POS-tagged file.
However, almost 200 lack a corresponding parsed file, since we stopped
parsing when we reached a million words -- often in the middle of a
directory of files.

In the atis directory, there are two versions:  "atis3.ogl" is the
"original" version, sent to us as a email message.  We edited this using
semi-automated means to make the format more acceptable to our processing
tools, and to make it easier to read; the result of this editing is called
simply "atis3".


CORRESPONDENCE TO OTHER RELEASES OF THIS TEXT

The true source of our "raw" Wall Street Journal files is lost in the
depths of time.  It is useful, however, to compare them to a more standard
release: the "ARPA TIPSTER Information Retrieval, Text Research Collection
Vol. 1, Revised March 1994", referred to below as TIPSTER.

In theory, these rawtext files consist of the first 2499 articles of the
1989 portion on TIPSTER, from the beginning of file wsj9_001 to the middle
of file wsj9_009.  However, there were apparently some bugs in the article
separation process, and so our rawtext wsj_2499 corresponds to the 2522'd
article of TIPSTER.

BUGS

There were also apparently some bugs in the extraction of text:

-- Originally-formatted text (from tables, forms, etc.) appears with @
signs in TIPSTER.  Apparently, this text was not supposed to be included in
our rawtext, but occasionally a sentence fragments and even whole sentences
have slipped through.  In an attempt to make the text more coherent, we
have generally removed such text, although some such fragments almost
certainly remain.  In one case, text that used to be after an apparently
erroneous @ sign was restored (wsj_0506).

-- Footnotes are generally left alone, although they frequently refer to
numbers in a (nonexistent) table.  (In the annotated texts, the footnote
markers (*,**,a,b,c,...) are generally treated as separate tokens, usually
POS-tagged SYM.)  Slightly incomprehensible sentences that apparently
introduced a table are similarly left intact.  There are whole files that
consist of only a table heading and footnotes, such as wsj_1342.

-- Note that there are about 20 *'s that mark footnotes.  In the parsed
texts, these are easy to confuse with null elements, though the distinction
is clear in the combined texts (null elements are tagged -NONE-, while
footnote markers are generally SYM).

-- Occasionally (about 100 times) the last word or two of an ordinary
sentence is missing.  There seems to be no consistent pattern for which
words might be deleted, but most of the cases seem to be a year (such as
"1991") or all-capital abbreviations (such as "FBI").  The grep pattern
'\<[a-z]\{1,3\} *$' gets many of the sentences that are missing words, but
misses a few and also matches to some lines of poetry.


Note that other releases of this data (including ACL/DCI and TIPSTER) also
have some minor bugs, including:

-- Exclamation points appear to be uniformly mapped to "]".  We suspect
this was originally caused by an EBCDIC to ASCII conversion; the following
unix pipeline:
	echo "|[hello]!" | dd conv=ibm | dd conv=ascii
produces the output:
	!\325hello\345]
where \325 stands for octal 325 (ascii 213 == meta-U), etc.
   We have mapped the ]'s back to ! in the rawtexts and other files of this
release.
   Note also that there are no square brackets [] in the text; where []'s
seem to be called for, curly braces ({}) seem to appear instead.

-- Datelines are stripped in our rawtexts, and separated out in TIPSTER.
Sometimes (about 8 times) the identified dateline is too long, as in the
following excerpt from wsj9_008:

 <DATELINE> NEW YORK -- The market gyrations were unbelievable  </DATELINE>
 <TEXT>
    literally.

We've left these as they were; the corresponding files start with a partial
sentence.  Most can be found in TIPSTER using "grep '^<DATELINE>.* [a-z]'".

-- There are about 70 known typographical errors, such as misspellings,
doubled words, missing dashes, and extraneous punctuation.  For the most
part, we have left these alone, since they are a natural feature of real
text.


DETAILS OF CHANGES

Removed all-capitals stuff (except .START) from:
(egrep '^CO.*\.START')
  11/wsj_1156:CO BBC CG TELV WGP+ .START
  22/wsj_2284:CO NW BCS U.LLO RBS+ .START
  23/wsj_2346:CO PCST RBS+ COB AIM EBPI .START

Removed fragmentary sentences in:
(grep '\<[a-z]*\. [a-z][^-]' plus some email)
  00/wsj_0057 01/wsj_0166 08/wsj_0887 08/wsj_0887 10/wsj_1058 10/wsj_1058

  23/wsj_2346

In 05/wsj_0506, restored missing part of sentence.  Looks like an accidental
@ sign in standard versions:
  @ Rockwell International Corp. received a $26.7 million Navy contract
 for submarine ballistic missiles.

In 00/wsj_0087, we had what used to be a pretty amusing form that is kind
of messy in Tipster and pretty garbled in our rawtext, though it had some
complete sentences.  I remove that entire section of the text.

Removed from 13/wsj_1337: table fragments plus an almost-complete sentence
in the middle of the table.

Removed stray ">" from 22/wsj_2229.

Removed line of table at end of 22/wsj_2289.

Removed table fragments (poll results?) from end of 16/wsj_1636.

Changed ] to ! in the following files:
