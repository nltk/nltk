Consolidated Rail Corp. said it would spend more than $30 million on 1,000 enclosed railcars for transporting autos. 

The multilevel railcars, scheduled for delivery in 1990, will be made by Thrall Manufacturing Co., a Chicago Heights, Ill., division of closely held Duchossois Industries Inc., Elmhurst, Ill.
This year, the railroad holding company acquired 850 such railcars.
