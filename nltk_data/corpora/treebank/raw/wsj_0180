Genetics Institute Inc., Cambridge, Mass., said it was awarded U.S. patents for Interleukin-3 and bone morphogenetic protein. 

The patent for Interleukin-3 covers materials and methods used to make the human blood cell growth factor via recombinant DNA technology.
Sandoz Ltd. has licensed certain manufacturing and marketing rights for Interleukin-3 from Genetics Institute and is conducting preclinical studies with it.
Interleukin-3 may help in treating blood cell deficiencies associated with cancer treatment, bone marrow transplants and other blood-cell disorders, Genetics Institute said. 

The second patent describes bone morphogenetic protein-1, a substance that can induce formation of new cartilage.
The patent covers BMP-1 type proteins and pharmaceutical compositions and methods for treating bone or cartilage defects, Genetics Institute said.
The company added that it has filed patent applications "on a large number of different BMP proteins" and the patent on BMP-1 is the first it has received.
BMP products may be useful in fracture healing and in treating bone loss associated with periodontal disease and certain cancers, the company said.
