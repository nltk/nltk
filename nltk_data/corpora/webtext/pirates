[sheet music on music stands in the rain]
[bouquet of white orchids, Elizabeth sitting in the rain holding the bouquet]
[men rowing, men on horseback, to the sound of thunder]
[EITC logo on flag blowing in the wind]
[many rowboats are entering the harbor]
[Elizabeth sitting alone, at a distance]
[marines running, kick a door in] 
[a mule is seen on the left in the barn where the marines enter]
[Liz looking over her shoulder]
[Elizabeth drops her bouquet]
[Will is in manacles, being escorted by red coats]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Will...!
[Elizabeth runs to Will]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Why is this happening? 
WILL TURNER: I don't know. You look beautiful.
ELIZABETH SWANN: I think it's bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding.
[marines cross their long axes to bar Governor from entering]
[Beckett, in white hair and curls, is standing with Mercer]
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Governor Weatherby Swann, it's been too long.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: His Lord now... actually.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: In fact, I *do*. Mister Mercer! The warrant for the arrest of one William Turner.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Oh, is it? That's annoying. My mistake. Arrest her.
ELIZABETH SWANN: On what charges?
WILL TURNER: No!
[Beckett takes another document from Mercer, who is standing with Beckett, craggy face and pony tail]
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Ah-ha! Here's the one for William Turner. And I have another one for a Mister James Norrington. Is he present?
ELIZABETH SWANN: *What are the charges?*
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: I don't believe that's the answer to the question I asked.
WILL TURNER: Lord Beckett! In the category of questions *not* answered...
ELIZABETH SWANN: We are under the jurisdiction of the King's governor of Port Royal, and you will tell us what we are charged with. 
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: For which the punishment, regrettably, is *also* death. Perhaps you remember a certain pirate named Jack Sparrow.
ELIZABETH SWANN: *Captain* Jack Sparrow.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Captain Jack Sparrow. Yes, I thought you might.
Scene: BLACK PEARL
[views of rigging ropes and blocks aboard a ship at night] 
[Gibbs walks the deck alone at night, singing and drinking from a bottle]
GIBBS: Fifteen men on a dead man's chest. Yo ho ho, and a *bottle* of rum. Drink and the devil had done for the rest. Yo ho ho, and a *bottle* of rum. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! 
[a bell tolls, Gibbs is interrupted from his drinking by the sound]
[Gibbs looks up to see a flock of crows flying in the foggy night sky]
Scene: TURKISH PRISON
[tolling of bells, camera pans to show the crows flying toward a coastal island] 
[pinnacle-like island off the coast at night, connected to the mainland by thin, lighted bridge]
[cages with men inside line the bridge]
[prisoners are being marched across the bridge]
[a male prisoner with bloody legs is muttering, and is dragged across the bridge by guards]
[a crow is seen reflected in the eye of one male prisoner in a cage, the crow attacks and pecks his eye out, he screams]
[the prisoner who was being dragged is taken down a hatch-like door in the ground, he also screams]
[rocky shoreline, lit with torches]
[men toss caskets into the sea]
[numerous caskets are floating out to sea, vertical streaks in the distant clouds are seen]
[a crow lands on one casket, begins pecking at the top] 
[sudden gunblast from inside the casket blows the crow away, along with much wood]
[hand holding flintlock pistol emerges, pans about, points it at audience for a moment]
[Jack breaks out of the top of the casket, puts his captain's hat on]
JACK SPARROW: Sorry, mate.
[Jack breaks the skeleton's leg off]
JACK SPARROW: Mind if we make a little side trip? I didn't think so.
[Jack uses the skeleton leg as an oar, rows toward the full moon and a waiting ship in the distance to the right of the moon]
Scene: BLACK PEARL
[Jack arrives at the Black Pearl in his coffin rowboat]
[Gibbs holds out his hand to help Jack aboard, Jack puts the skeleton leg in Gibbs' hand]
[Cotton drapes a coat onto Jack's back]
GIBBS: Not *quite* according to plan.
JACK SPARROW: Complications arose, ensued, were overcome.
GIBBS: You got what you went in for, then?
JACK SPARROW: Mm-hmm!
GIBBS: Captain, I think the crew, meaning me as well, were expecting something a bit more... *shiny*. What with the Isla de Muerta going all pear shaped, reclaimed by the sea, and the treasure with it. 
LEECH: And the Royal Navy chasing us all around the Atlantic. 
MARTY: And the hurricane! Aye.
CREW: Aye. Aye.
GIBBS: All in all, it's seems some time since we did a speck of honest pirating.
JACK SPARROW: Shiny?
GIBBS: Aye, shiny.
JACK SPARROW: Is that how you're all feeling, then? Perhaps dear old Jack is not serving your best interests as captain?
COTTON'S PARROT: Awk! Walk the plank! 
[Jack grabs his pistol and points it at the bird]
JACK SPARROW: What did the bird say?
LEECH: Do not blame the bird. Show us what is on that piece of cloth there. 
[the monkey snarls, seizes the cloth, scampers off with it]
JACK SPARROW: Ohhh!
[Jack attempts to shoot the monkey with his pistol, his pistol misfires]
[Jack grabs a pistol from another crewman and blasts the monkey while it's on the deck]
[the monkey drops the cloth, but is unharmed, and scurries into the rigging]
GIBBS: Know that don't do no good. 
JACK SPARROW: It does me.
[Marty picks up the cloth that the monkey dropped]
MARTY: It's a key!
JACK SPARROW: No! Much more better. It is a *drawing* of a key. 
[Jack holds up the cloth, the crew crowd forward]
[Among the crew: Chinese man, black man with a black beard, white bearded man with large black hat]
JACK SPARROW: Gentlemen, what do keys do?
LEECH: Keys... unlock... *things*? 
GIBBS: And whatever this key unlocks, *inside* there's something valuable. So, we're setting out to find whatever this key unlocks!
JACK SPARROW: No! If we don't have the key, we can't open whatever it is we don't have that it unlocks. So what purpose would be served in finding whatever need be unlocked, which we don't have, without first having found the key what unlocks it?
GIBBS: So - We're going after this key!
JACK SPARROW: You're not making any sense at all. Any more questions?
MARTY: So... Do we have a heading?
JACK SPARROW: Hah! A heading. Set sail in a... mmm... a general... in *that* way - direction. 
GIBBS: Cap'n? 
JACK SPARROW: Come on, snap to and make sail, you know how this works. Come on, oy/quick, oy/quick, hey!
[Marty and Gibbs gather alone by the railing]
MARTY: Have you noticed lately... The captain seems to be actin' a bit strange... -er. 
GIBBS: Settin' sail without knowing his own headin'? Somethin's got Jack vexed. Mark my words, what bodes ill for Jack Sparrow bodes ill for us all.
[the Black Pearl is shown at night in a thunderstorm]
Scene: PORT ROYAL: EITC HEADQUARTERS
[a painter is painting a detail on a mural of a world map]
[a guard brings Will in manacles into Beckett's office]
GUARD: Lord Beckett. The prisoner as ordered, Sir. 
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Those won't be necessary.
[Will's manacles are removed]
[Beckett pours some liquor] 
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: The East India Trading Company has need of your services. We wish for you to act as our agent in a business transaction with our mutual friend: Captain Sparrow.
WILL TURNER: More acquaintance than friend. How do you know him?
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: We've had dealings in the past. And we've each left our mark... on the other. 
WILL TURNER: What mark did he leave on you? 
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: By your efforts Jack Sparrow was set free. I would like you to go to him, and recover a certain property in his possession.
WILL TURNER: Recover. At the point of a sword?
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: *Bargain*!
[Beckett goes over to a wooden box on a table and opens it]
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Letters of Marque. You will offer what amounts to a full pardon. Jack will be free, a privateer in the employ of England.
WILL TURNER: Somehow I doubt Jack will consider employment the same as being free.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Freedom. Jack Sparrow is a dying breed. The world is shrinking, the blank pages of the map filled in. Jack must find his place in the new world or perish. Not unlike you, Mister Turner. You and your fiancée face the hangman's noose. 
WILL TURNER: So you get both Jack *and* the Black Pearl.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: The Black Pearl?
WILL TURNER: The property you want that he possesses.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: A ship? Hardly. The item in question's considerably smaller and far more valuable. Something Sparrow keeps on his person at all times. A compass. Ah, you know it. Bring back that Compass, or there's no deal.
Scene: BLACK PEARL
[Jack is using calipers on a map, using his left hand, a "P" brand mark is seen on his right arm]
[an hourglass is in the background, Jack taps the Compass]
[Jack looks in his bottle, turns the bottle upside-down, only a few drops spill out]
JACK SPARROW: Why is the rum always gone?
[Jack rises to his feet, staggers]
[Jack picks up his hat off the top of a globe]
JACK SPARROW: Oh! *That's* why.
[Jack walks past the crew sleeping on hammocks, Jack is carrying a lantern]
[some of the crew are snoring, and Cotton is among those sleeping]
JACK SPARROW: As you were, gents.
[Jack goes downstairs to the hold, an animal bleats, Jack unlocks the door, goes in]
[Jack sees eerie filter feeder creatures festooning a beam of wood]
[Jack spots a rack of bottles, with the bottles stored sideways like in a wine rack]
JACK SPARROW: Ah!
[Jack pulls a sideways bottle from the rack]
[Jack pours sand out of the bottle] 
[Jack drops bottle of rum in fright, the bottle breaks on the floor]
[Jack walks over to see who spoke]
JACK SPARROW: Bootstrap. Bill Turner.
[Bootstrap looks up from where he's sitting on a barrel, crabs scuttle across his face]
JACK SPARROW: Is this a dream?
JACK SPARROW: I thought not. If it were, there'd be rum.
[Bootstrap immediately hands Jack a bottle of rum]
[Jack pries the bottle from Bootstrap's hand with a crackling sound]
JACK SPARROW: I had some help retrieving the Pearl, by the way.
[Jack tinks the lip of the bottle with his fingers, then blows across the top of the bottle]
JACK SPARROW: Your son.
[Jack takes a drink from the bottle]
JACK SPARROW: And to what do I owe the pleasure of your carbuncle? 
JACK SPARROW: Who?
JACK SPARROW: Ah. So it's you, then. He shanghaied you into service, eh? 
[a small hermit crab scuttles by Bootstrap, on top of the barrel where Bootstrap sits]
[Bootstrap grabs the hermit crab, pops it into his mouth, and crunches on it]
[Jack moves his mouth, jaw, and tongue around in revulsion while watching]
[Jack hands the bottle back to Bootstrap]
JACK SPARROW: It's funny what a man will do to forestall his final judgment -
[Jack starts to walk off, but Bootstrap stands up at the same time and intercepts Jack, blocking him]
JACK SPARROW: Technic -
JACK SPARROW: Yes, but the Flying Dutchman already *has* a captain, so there's re -
JACK SPARROW: Any idea when Jones might release said terrible beastie? 
[Jack looks at the palm of his left hand, where a black spot boils into view]
[Jack looks up, but Bootstrap has disappeared]
Scene: BLACK PEARL: ON DECK
[Jack runs across a wooden deck that has a shallow covering of water]
JACK SPARROW: On deck all hands! Make fast the bunt gasket! On deck! Scurry! Scurry-on/Marty, I want movement!
JACK SPARROW: *I want movement!* 
GIBBS: Lift the skin up! 
JACK SPARROW: All on deck! Run! And keep running! Run as if the devil himself and itself is upon us! 
GIBBS: Do we have a heading?
JACK SPARROW: Ah! Ooh! Run! Land.
[Jack rises from where he was ducked behind the base of the mast, sees Gibbs again]
JACK SPARROW: Oh! Euh!
GIBBS: Which port?
JACK SPARROW: Didn't say port. I said land. Any land.
[the monkey in skeleton form swings down, grabs Jack's hat]
JACK SPARROW: Agh!
[the monkey snarls at Jack, Jack snarls back at the monkey, in imitation]
[the monkey throws Jack's hat overboard
GIBBS: Jack's hat! Bring 'er about! 
JACK SPARROW: No no! Leave it! Run! 
GIBBS: Back to your stations! The lot o' ya!
[Jack stands stiffly in the shadows under some steps, between two lighted windows]

GIBBS: Jack?
JACK SPARROW: Shhh!
GIBBS: For the love of mother and child, Jack, what's coming after us? 
JACK SPARROW: Nothing.

CARRUTHERS: Here now. He can't be here.
CARRUTHERS: Mister Swann, -
ELIZABETH SWANN: Jack's Compass. What does Beckett want with that?
WILL TURNER: Does it matter? I'm to find Jack and convince him to return to Port Royal. In exchange the charges against us will be dropped.
WILL TURNER: Is that lack of faith in Jack, or in me?
ELIZABETH SWANN: I have faith in you. Both of you. Where will you find him? 
WILL TURNER: Tortuga. I'll start there, and I won't stop searching 'til I find him. And then I intend to return here, to marry you. 
ELIZABETH SWANN: Properly? 
WILL TURNER: Eagerly, if you'll still have me.
ELIZABETH SWANN: If it weren't for these bars I'd have you already. 
[the governor accidentally knocks a candleholder off the wall]
[the governor tosses the candleholder aside, onto the floor]
ELIZABETH SWANN: I'll wait for you.
WILL TURNER: Keep a weather eye on the horizon.
[Will walks back up the prison steps]
Scene: Tortuga
WEATHERED SAILOR: *Captain* Jack Sparrow? Owes me four dubloons. Heard he was dead. 
HALF-BLIND FISHERMAN: Singapore. That's what I heard. Drunk with a smile on his face. Sure as the tide, Jack Sparrow... will turn up in Singapore. 
[Scarlett is a redhead, Giselle is a blonde, both are standing together, answering Will's questions]
GISELLE: Jack Sparrow!
SCARLETT: I haven't seen 'im in a month.
GISELLE: When you find him, will you give him a message? 
[Giselle slaps Will in the face]
[a black man who is a shrimper is sitting on a dock, mending his nets]
[in the background is a bunch of bananas on the dock, and a goat being loaded aboard a ship]

[one cannibal is wearing an English white wig and using a Western style fan]
?: Hurry-hurry tan daga! 
[Will is brought before Jack, who sits on a throne]
[the music stops, Jack pops his eyes open, revealing that his closed eyelids were painted to look like open eyes]
WILL TURNER: Jack? Jack Sparrow! I can honestly say I'm glad to see you!
[Jack says nothing, arises from his throne, walks over to Will]
[Jack pushes one finger into Will's shoulder, as if testing how much meat Will has on him]

CANNIBAL CROWD: Eeseepi.

CANNIBAL CROWD: Ahhh... eunuchy!
[Jack begins to walk away, as if disinterested, his Compass hangs from his waist]
WILL TURNER: Jack! The Compass! That's all I need, Elizabeth is in danger. We were arrested for trying to help *you*. She faces the gallows!
[Jack halts, pauses, turns around and casually walks back]
JACK SPARROW: Say-say lam shoop-shoop sha smalay-lama shoo-koo. Savvy? Ball licky-licky. Ball licky-licky!
CANNIBAL CROWD: Ball licky-licky!
[the cannibals begin chanting, repetitiously]

Prisoners: Where you goin'...?)

ELIZABETH SWANN: No! Will has gone to find Jack!
ELIZABETH SWANN: He's a better man than you give him credit for. 
[a horse and carriage are waiting, the governor opens the door to the carriage for Elizabeth]
ELIZABETH SWANN: A fair trial for Will ends in a hanging.
[the horse and carriage quickly ride off]
[the horse and carriage arrive at a dock]
[Captain Hawkins stands silently on the dock facing out to sea]
[the captain's body soon falls, revealing Mercer, who was standing behind the body, long knife in hand]

PORT ROYAL: EITC headquarters
[darkened room]
[Beckett walks in from the balcony, carrying a lantern]
[Beckett walks to a table, opens a wooden box, finds the Letters of Marque missing]
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: No doubt you've discovered that loyalty is no longer the currency of the realm, as your father believes.
[Elizabeth slips into the dark room from an interior door, hands held behind her]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Then what is?
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: I'm afraid that *currency* is the currency of the realm.
ELIZABETH SWANN: I expect then that we can come to some sort of understanding. I'm here to negotiate.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: I'm listening.
[Elizabeth pulls a pistol, points it at Beckett's head]
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: I'm listening *intently*.
ELIZABETH SWANN: These Letters of Marque, they are signed by the King?
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Yes, and they're not valid until they bear my signature and my seal.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Or else I would not still be here. You sent Will to get you the Compass owned by Jack Sparrow. It will do you no good. 
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Do explain.
ELIZABETH SWANN: I have been to Isla de Muerta, I have seen the treasure myself. There is something you need to know.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Ah, I see. *You* think the Compass leads only to the Isla de Muerta, and so you hope to *save* me from an evil fate. But you mustn't worry. I care not for cursed Aztec gold. My desires are not so provincial. There's more than one chest of value in these waters. So perhaps you may wish to enhance your offer. 
[Elizabeth cocks her pistol]
[Beckett signs the document]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Consider into your calculations that you robbed me of my wedding night.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: So I did. A marriage interrupted. Or fate intervenes. You make great efforts to ensure Jack Sparrow's freedom. 
ELIZABETH SWANN: These aren't going to Jack.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Oh really. To ensure Mister Turner's freedom, then? I'll still want that Compass. Consider that in your calculations. Longboat
[Ragetti appears to be reading a Bible in the back of the longboat, but the Bible is upside-down]
RAGETTI: Well I say it was divine providence what escaped us from jail.
PINTEL: And I say... it was me bein' *clever*. Ain't that right, poochie?
[the dog goes to the bow, looking forward, keys in its mouth] 
RAGETTI: ?: Well how'dya know it weren't/wasn't divine providence what inspired you to *be* clever? Anyways, I ain't stealin' no ship. 
PINTEL: It ain't stealin'. It's *salvagin'*! And since when did you care? 
RAGETTI: Since we're not immortal no more. We gotta take care of our immortal souls. 
PINTEL: You know you can't read.
RAGETTI: It's the Bible. You get credit for trying. 
PINTEL: Pretendin' to read the Bible's a *lie*! *That's* a mark against ya! Look! There it is! 
[the dog jumps overboard and swims toward shore]
RAGETTI: What's got into *'im*? 
PINTEL: Must've seen a catfish. Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh.
[both laugh, the dog reaches shore and looks back at them]
RAGETTI: Stupid mongrel!
[the dog on shore shakes off water, looks back at them, still holding keys in its mouth] 
[their boat capsizes in a wave, they wade ashore]
Scene: CANNIBAL ISLAND: beach
PINTEL: Come on! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. Ha-ha-ha-ha... 
###PINTEL: It's ours for the taking! 
RAGETTI: Tide's comin', that should help. Well, salvagin' is saving, in a manner of speaking.
PINTEL: There's the truth of *it*! ###
[cannibal drums sound]
RAGETTI: Suppose we be'er... save it as soon as we can. What with our souls in such a vulnerable state, and all.
PINTEL: Amen to that.
[the dog barks]

[Jack spits out the piece of nail, reexamines the toe]
Scene: CANNIBAL ISLAND: cages
[two spherical cages of six Black Pearl crewmen apiece hang from ropes over a deep chasm] 
[Will is in the same cage with Gibbs, Cotton, Marty, and two others]
WILL TURNER: Why would he do this to us? If Jack is their chief.
GIBBS: Aye, the Pelegostos made Jack their chief. But he only remains chief as long as he *acts* like a chief. 
WILL TURNER: So he had no choice. He's a captive then as much as the rest of us.
GIBBS: Worse... as it turns out. See, the Pelegostos believe that Jack is a *god* in human form, and they intend to do him the honor of releasing him from his fleshy prison.
[Cotton bites Gibbs' fingers to illustrate]
GIBBS: Argh! They'll roast him and eat him.
WILL TURNER: Where's the rest of the crew?
GIBBS: These cages we're in... weren't built 'til *after* we got here.
[Will was gripping the bars made of human bones, but quickly pulls his hand away]
GIBBS: The feast is about to begin. Jack's life will end... when the drums stop.
WILL TURNER: Well, we can't just sit here and wait then, can we?
Scene: CANNIBAL ISLAND: throne
[cannibal drums are pounding]
JACK SPARROW: No/Oup! No no! Oy!/Wait! No no! More wood! Big fire! *Big* fire! I am chief! Want big fire! Come on!
JACK SPARROW: Oy!/Boy! Maboogie snickel-snickel. Tout de suite! Come on! More wood!
[the cannibal standing next to Jack leaves to put more wood on the fire]

[Jack goes into a hut, sees various supplies, the sound of buzzing flies is heard]
[Jack picks up a rope, starts to exit, halts, looks back inside]
[Jack goes back in, picks up a can of paprika with the EITC logo on the bottom]
[Jack walks outside the hut, the entire tribe is waiting silently outside, staring at him] 
JACK SPARROW: Oh bugger.
[Jack drops his coil of rope, sprinkles paprika on his armpits]
JACK SPARROW: Little seasoning. Eh?
[Jack is now tied up to a bamboo pole and hanging face down over a pile of wood]
[cannibals are dancing wildly]
JACK SPARROW: Well done.
Scene: CANNIBAL ISLAND: cages
[the men begin swinging the cages with increasingly wide arcs]
[both cages finally come within reach of the cliff, they grab vines and hang on to the cliff]
GIBBS: Put your legs through, start to climb! Agh!
WILL TURNER: Come on men! It'll take all of-us/the-rest to crew the Black Pearl!
LEECH: Actually, you won't need everyone. 'Bout six would do! Ohhh... dear. 
[Gibbs nods]
WILL TURNER: Hurry!
[each cage group begins racing against each other up the cliff] Come on! Go! Go! Go! Come on! Give it all you got!
[a cannibal crosses the rope bridge]
Hey! Hey ###
WILL TURNER: Stop! Stop! Stop! Shhh! Shhh!
[the cannibal crosses rope bridge]
LEECH: Shhh!
[one cage group decides to take the risk of climbing, despite the nearby cannibal] What's he doing?
LEEECH: Stop! ...
[one of the men in the climbing cage grabs a coral snake from the cliff instead of a vine] [p. 50] 
[when the man holding the snake lets go, their cage falls, the rope breaks, and their cage falls to the bottom]
WILL TURNER: Move!
CANNIBAL ISLAND: throne
[drums pounding, a cannibal crosses a bridge to the bonfire area] Ahhh! Fye-fye!
CANNIBAL CROWD: Ahhh! Fye-fye!
[the cannibal from the bridge arrives to tell the tribe of the men in cages escaping] Da latazo! Da litozo! Hay la paka say-say.
[the crowd stands silently, not knowing whether to stay or to chase the escapees]
JACK SPARROW: Well, go on! Go get them! Hay ala!
CANNIBAL CROWD: Hay ala! Ala, ala!
[cannibals run off to chase after men who escaped from cages]
[in their haste one cannibal drops a lighted torch need the pile of wood under Jack]
JACK SPARROW: No! No no! Oy! No no!
[the edges of the wood begin to catch fire]
JACK SPARROW: Not good.
[Jack blows futilely at the igniting wood]
Scene: CANNIBAL ISLAND: cage
[the remaining cage reaches the top of the cliff]
WILL TURNER: Cut it loose! Find a rock!
[Will manages to sever the cage's cable by hammering it with a rock]
[the men in Will's cage are unable to the cage open in time before the cannibals will reach them]
WILL TURNER: Roll the cage!
[the cage rolls down the hill]
[the cage falls over the edge of a tiny cliff]
[the cage rolls down the hill, rolls up a coconut palm trunk, crashes to the ground, unbroken]
WILL TURNER: Lift the cage! Hurry!
GIBBS: Come on, men! Lift it like a lady's skirt!
[the men begin running with their legs protruding from the cage, holding up the cage]
[Marty's short legs make a running motion but are unable to reach the ground] Come on!
Scene: CANNIBAL ISLAND: hut
[Jack is running off with the bamboo pole tied to his back]
[Jack encounters the cannibal boy, standing silently with a fork and a knife, one in each hand]
[Jack grabs the knife from the boy, and begins cutting his rope off]
[two cannibal women appear]
[Jack charges, but the bamboo pole on his back spears a coconut in a pile near the cliff edge]

[the cannibal slowly lifts the dripping coconut off his face, scowling at Jack]
Scene: CANNIBAL ISLAND: cage
[the cage rolls over a ledge into a small chasm holding a river]
[cannibals throw spears and shoot arrows at the men in the water, the men swim underwater]
GIBBS: This way, lads! 
Scene: CANNIBAL ISLAND: Jack
[the two cannibal women throw numerous fruits at Jack while the pole is still on his back]
[several of the fruits become impaled along the pole, making Jack look like he's part of a shish-ka-bob]
CANNIBAL BOY: Da litozo! Da litozo!
[Jack pole vaults across the chasm, barely lands on the other edge safely]
[but the fruit slides down to the end of his pole, putting weight on the end over the chasm]
[Jack falls into the chasm, screaming]
[Jack's pole catches between the two walls of a chasm]
[two native women watch Jack fall into the chasm, with disinterest]
CANNIBAL WOMAN: A-geev-nee. Uh-boogie?
[the two cannibal women walk off, disinterested]
JACK SPARROW: Bugger.
[Jack's pole slips loose, he falls into the chasm, screaming]
[As Jack falls through the first rope bridge, the rope comes undone but is still attached to the bamboo pole and to Jack]
[Jack is hung upside-down in the chasm when the bamboo pole catches]
[Jack falls through a total of six rope bridges]
[Jack lands on his back on grass]
[bamboo pole comes down at him, spears the ground near his head]
[fruits tumble down afterwards]
Scene: CANNIBAL ISLAND: beach
[only Ragetti and Cotton's parrot are aboard the Black Pearl, Pintel is on the beach below]
PINTEL: Pull-loose/Unloose the mooring lines! The mooring lines!
[the monkey chatters, grabs Ragetti's wooden eye] 
RAGETTI: Thief/Thing! Little hairy thief/thing! Give it back! Don't bite it!
PINTEL: Unloose the mooring lines!
RAGETTI: He's got me eye! He won't give it back!
PINTEL: Well, how'd you get it back last time?
GIBBS: Excellent work! Work's half done!
PINTEL: We done it for you! Knowin' you'd be comin' back for us.
GIBBS: Make/Making ready tosail/cast-off ###, boy.
WILL TURNER: What about Jack? I won't leave without him.
JACK SPARROW: Hey! 
[Jack appears at a distance, running down the beach toward the crew and ship]
[a crowd of cannibals suddenly run down on the beach behind Jack, pursuing him]
WILL TURNER: Time to go. 
GIBBS: *Cast off those lines!*
[Jack screams while running down the beach]
GIBBS: Make ready to cast off! ###!
[the dog is down the beach with Jack, barking at him]
JACK SPARROW: Good doggie! Doggie. 
[Jack grabs ahold of rigging on the side of the departing ship]
JACK SPARROW: *Alas*, my children! This is the day you shall always remember as the day that you almost -
[big wave splashes Jack from behind]
JACK SPARROW: ...Captain Jack... Sparrow.
[the crowd of cannibals falls silent as the ship leaves]
[the dog barks excitedly at the departing ship]
[all heads in the crowd of cannibals turn toward the dog]
[the dog falls silent, whimpers, then flees back down the beach]
[the cannibals chase the dog, shouting] 
Scene: Black Pearl
GIBBS: Let's put some distance between us and this island, and head out to open sea.
JACK SPARROW: Yes to the first, yes to the second, but only insofar as we keep to the shallows as much as possible.
GIBBS: Uh, that seems a bit contradictory, Captain. 
JACK SPARROW: I have every faith in your reconciliatory navigational skills, Master Gibbs, now where is that monkey? I want to shoot *something*.
[the monkey screams, drops Ragetti's eye, Ragetti grabs his eye, spits on it, rubs the spit around on it]
[the monkey chatters and climbs into the rigging]
[Jack is ready to shoot the monkey with his pistol]
WILL TURNER: Jack.
JACK SPARROW: Ah.
WILL TURNER: Elizabeth is in danger.
JACK SPARROW: Have you considered keeping a more watchful eye on 'er? Maybe just lock her up somewhere. 
WILL TURNER: She *is* locked up, in a prison, bound to hang for helping *you*!
JACK SPARROW: There comes a time when one must take responsibility for one's mistakes.
[Will pulls a sword from the waistband of a pirate who is turned around, points it at Jack] 
WILL TURNER: I need that Compass of yours, Jack. I must trade it for her freedom.
[Jack pushes Will's sword aside]
JACK SPARROW: Mister Gibbs!
GIBBS: Cap'n.
JACK SPARROW: We have a need to travel upriver.
GIBBS: By need, d'you mean a... trifling need, uh/a... fleeting, as in say in a passing fancy?
JACK SPARROW: No, a... resolute and unyielding need.
WILL TURNER: What we need to do is make sail for Port Royal with all haste.
JACK SPARROW: William... I shall trade you the Compass, if you will help me... to find *this*. 
WILL TURNER: You want me to find this?
JACK SPARROW: No. *You* want you to find this. Because the finding this finds you incapacitorially finding and/or locating and your discovering the detecting of a way to save your dolly/dotty belle ol'... what's-her-face. Savvy? 
WILL TURNER: This... is going to save Elizabeth?
JACK SPARROW: How much do you know about Davy Jones?
WILL TURNER: Not much.
JACK SPARROW: Yeah, it's gonna save Elizabeth.
Scene: Edinburgh Trader
[a crewman swabbing the deck happens to notice a white dress tucked in a corner, pulls it out]
[the crewmen are arguing loudly about the newfound dress]
BELLAMY: What's all this? If you both fancy the dress, you'll just have to share, and wear it one after the other. 
BURSAR: It's not like that, Sir. This ship is haunted. 
BELLAMY: Is it now? 'N' you? 
QUARTERMASTER: The... female presence... amongst us, yes... all the men... they can feel it. The ghost of a lady, widowed before her marriage, I figure it. Searching for her husband, lost at sea. A virgin, too, likely as not. And that bodes ill by all accounts.
BURSAR: I say... that we throw the dress overboard, and we hope the spirit finds it. 
QUARTERMASTER: No! That - that will just anger the spirit, Sir. What we need to do is find out what the spirit needs, and then just get it back! 
BELLAMY: Enough! Enough! You're a pair of superstitious goats and it's got the best of you. Now this appears to be no more as we have a stowaway aboard. A young woman, by the look of it. I want you to search the ship and find 'er. Oh, and uh... she's probably naked. 
[the crew enthusiastically rushes off in search of the stowaway] Pantano River
[aerial view of the mouth of the Pantano River, two longboats are beginning their way up the river]
[the longboats are in a swampy area with twisted roots]
WILL TURNER: Why is Jack afraid of the open ocean?
GIBBS: Well, if you believe such things, there's a beast does the bidding of Davy Jones. A fearsome creature with giant tentacles that suction your face clean off. And drag an entire ship past the crushing darkness. The Kraken!
[Marty turns around at mention of the word, Pintel and Ragetti look at each other]
GIBBS: They say the stench of its breath is like - ooh! Imagine: The last thing you know on God's green earth is the roar of the Kraken, and the reeking odor of a thousand rotting corpses. If you believe such things. 
WILL TURNER: And the key will spare him that?
GIBBS: Now that's the very question Jack wants answered. Bad enough even to go visit... *Her*.
WILL TURNER: Her?
GIBBS: Aye.
BAYOU: Tia's shack
[bayou with fireflies, and an iguana on a tree trunk on the left]
[the iguana eats a firefly with a quick slurping sound]
[people are occasionally seen standing quietly in the darkness among the trees]
JACK SPARROW: No worries, mates. Tia Dalma and I go way back. Thick as thieves. Nigh inseparable we are. Were. Have been. Before. 
GIBBS: I'll watch your back.
JACK SPARROW: It's me front I'm worried about. Mind the boat.
GIBBS: Mind the boat.
WILL TURNER: Mind the boat.
PINTEL: Mind the boat.
MARTY: Mind the boat.
COTTON'S PARROT: Awk! Mind the boat! 
[Cotton is left alone in the longboat]
[Jack cautiously enter's Tia's shack, pushing the door open slowly]
[near the inside of the shack door hangs a live snake, moving slowly] 
[Tia is sitting at a table, looks up from her crab claws, sees Jack in the doorway]
TIA DALMA: Jack Sparrow! 
JACK SPARROW: Tia Dalma!
TIA DALMA: I always know de wind was goin' blow you back to me one day. 
[Tia sees Will standing in the doorway, goes up to him]
TIA DALMA: You. You have a touch of... destiny about *you*, William Turner.
WILL TURNER: You know me?
TIA DALMA: You want to know *me*.
JACK SPARROW: There'll be no knowing here. We've come for help and we're not leaving without it.
JACK SPARROW: I thought *I* knew you.
TIA DALMA: Not so well as I had hoped. Come.
JACK SPARROW: Come.
TIA DALMA: What... service... may I do you? Hmmm? You know I demand payment.
JACK SPARROW: I brought payment.
[Jack whistles once, a crewmember brings in the monkey in a cage]
JACK SPARROW: Look!
[Jack cocks his pistol, shoots the monkey, the bullet has no effect, but the monkey chatters in fright]
JACK SPARROW: An undead monkey! Top that!
[Tia lifts the cage door, the monkey scampers off]
GIBBS: No! You've no idea how long it took us to catch that. 
TIA DALMA: The payment is fair.
JACK SPARROW: We're looking for this. And what it goes to.
TIA DALMA: The Compass you bartered from me. It cannot lead you to dis? 
JACK SPARROW: Maybe. Why?
TIA DALMA: Ayeee... Jack Sparrow does not know what he wants! Or... do know, but are loathe to claim it as your own. Your key go to a chest, and it is what lay inside the chest you seek, don't it? 
GIBBS: What *is* inside?
PINTEL: Gold! Jewels? Unclaimed properties of a valuable nature? 
RAGETTI: Nothing... bad, I hope.
[a jar of eyeballs is hanging next to Ragetti's face as he speaks] 
TIA DALMA: You know of... Davy Jones, yes? A man of de sea. A great sailor, until he ran afoul of dat which vex all men.
WILL TURNER: What vexes all men?
TIA DALMA: What, indeed.
GIBBS: The sea?
PINTEL: Sums!
RAGETTI: Dichotomy of good and evil.
JACK SPARROW: A *woman*.
TIA DALMA: A wo-*man*. He fell in love.
GIBBS: No-no-no-no, I heard it was the *sea* he fell in love with.
TIA DALMA: Same story, different versions, and all are true. See, it was a *woman*, as changing, and harsh, and untamable as the sea. Him never stopped loving her. But the pain it cause 'im was too much to live wid. But not enough to cause him to die.
WILL TURNER: What... exactly did he put into the chest?
TIA DALMA: Him heart.
RAGETTI: Literally, or figuratively?
PINTEL: He couldn't li'erally put his heart in a chest! Could he?
TIA DALMA: It was not wort' feeling what... small fleeting joy life brings, and so... he carved out him heart, lock it away in a chest, and hide de chest from de world. De keys, he keep wid him at all times.
WILL TURNER: You knew this.
JACK SPARROW: I did not. I didn't know where the key was. But now we do. So all that's left is to climb aboard the Flying Dutchman, grab the key, you go back to Port Royal and save your bonnie lass, hey!
TIA DALMA: Let me see your hand.
[Jack shows his right hand is untouched, but Tia unwraps the bandage on his left hand]
[the black spot on Jack's left hand is revealed]
GIBBS: Uhhh! The black spot!
[Gibbs quickly wipes his hands on his chest, spins around once to the left, and spits] Black spot! Black spot!
[Pintel and Ragetti copy Gibbs' ritual, in synchrony]
JACK SPARROW: My eyesight's as good as ever, just so you know. 
[pushing aside cloth door beads, Tia goes into a back room, and searches for something]
TIA DALMA: I am justMy little ###, where are you? ###
[Jack steals a ring off of one of Tia's tables, beside the ring is a silver locket] 
[Tia comes back with an object from the back room]
TIA DALMA: Davy Jones cannot make port. Cannot step on land but once every ten years. Land is where you are safe, Jack Sparrow. And so you will carry land wid you... 
[Tia hands Jack a jar of dirt]
JACK SPARROW: Dirt. This is a jar of dirt.
TIA DALMA: Yes?
JACK SPARROW: Is the... jar of dirt going to help?
TIA DALMA: If you don' want it, give it back.
JACK SPARROW: No. 
TIA DALMA: Den it helps.
WILL TURNER: It seems... we have a need to find the Flying Dutchman.
[Tia is sitting, she holds several crab shells between her cupped hands and closes her eyes]
TIA DALMA: A touch... of destiny!
[Tia throws the crab claws down on the table to see how they fall] 
[fade to aerial view of rocky islands whose positions match the positions of the crab claws] Black Pearl
[pan beyond the rocks to the Black Pearl just offshore, in stormy weather]
[the Black Pearl crew look at the scuttled ship on the rocks]
WILL TURNER: That's the Flying Dutchman? She doesn't look like much.
JACK SPARROW: Neither do you. Do *not* underestimate her.
[Jack gives Gibbs a meaningful glance, elbows Gibbs]
GIBBS: Must've run afoul of the reef.
JACK SPARROW: So what's your plan, then?
WILL TURNER: I row over, search the ship until I find your bloody key. 
JACK SPARROW: And if there are crewmen?
WILL TURNER: I cut down anyone in my path.
JACK SPARROW: I like it. Simple, easy to remember.
RAGETTI: Your chariot awaits you, sire! Ha, ha-ha-ha, ha-ha!
JACK SPARROW: Hey! If you *do* happen to get captured, just say Jack Sparrow sent you to settle his debt! Might save your life!
RAGETTI: Bon voyage! Ha-ha-ha!
JACK SPARROW: Douse the lamps.
[Marty douses a lamp, then Cotton douses a lamp, then Pintel douses a lamp]
[Will sets off in a rowboat, alone, toward the scuttled ship]
SCUTTLED SHIP: before attack
[Will goes aboard the ship, lantern in hand]
[Will passes one dead crewman at deck level, proped up behind net-like rigging]
[Will comes across a wounded sailor, who seems to be in shock]
[the wounded sailor is pulling on a pulley desperately, muttering to himself]
WOUNDED SAILOR: ...up the...
WILL TURNER: Sailor!
WOUNDED SAILOR: ...the stench...capsized...
WILL TURNER: Sailor!
WOUNDED SAILOR: ...bring a...
WILL TURNER: There's no use. You've run aground.
WOUNDED SAILOR: No! Beneath us! Foul breath!
[behind Will, a crewmember's body falls from a height, splashing into the water]
[Will goes to investigate]
WILL TURNER: Hey! Hey!
[Will turns the man's body over to see his face]
[the man's face is gone, his face is just a puckered piece of skin, which bulges outward]
[the real Flying Dutchman suddenly rises from the sea, nearby the scuttled ship]
[the sea creature-like crew emerge from the surfaces of the Flying Dutchman]
[crewmembers from the Flying Dutchman attack the remaining crew of the scuttled ship]
GREENBEARD: Down on your marrowbones, and pray. 
[Will engages in a swordfight against several invaders]
[Will dips his sword in oil, causing it to flame, and waves it at the men surrounding him]
WILL TURNER: Get back! Back!
[Will slices open the stomach of one of the invaders, fish spill out of it onto the deck]
[Will battles the invading crewmembers, but one of them knocks Will unconscious] Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
SCUTTLED SHIP: after attack
[the prisoners of the scuttled ship cower in fear, lined up, sitting in a row on deck along the railing]
[Jack is at the end of the row of five survivors total, on the right-side when facing the survivors]
[Davy Jones stomps aboard with his peg leg, underwater view of his departing feet]
[Maccus is on deck, turned so that his back is shown, showing lobster legs on his back]
MACCUS: Five men still alive. The rest have moved on. 
[Jones pauses to clench his left hand, which is a large lobster claw]
[Jones casually lights a pipe in front of one of the cowering crewmen]
DAVY JONES: Do you fear death? Do you fear that dark abyss? All your deeds laid bare. All your sins punished. I can offer you... an escape-uh.
CHAPLAIN: Don't listen to him! 
[Jones walks over to the chaplain, takes the chaplain's head in his claw]
DAVY JONES: Do you not fear death? 
CHAPLAIN: I'll take my chances, Sir.
DAVY JONES: To the depths.
[the chaplain's throat is slit, two crewmembers throw his body overboard] Ah, ha-ha-ha...!
[unidentified crewman] Cold blooded - !
DAVY JONES: Life is cruel. Why should the afterlife be any *different*? I offer you a choice. Join my crew, and postpone the judgment. One hundred years before the mast. Will ye serve?
HELMSMAN: I - I will, serve. 
DAVY JONES: Grand. 
[Jones looks pleased, then sees Will at the end of the line of people]
[Jones stomps over to Will]
DAVY JONES: *You* are neither dead nor dying. What is your purpose here?
WILL TURNER: Jack Sparrow sent me to settle his debt.
DAVY JONES: What is your purpose here?
WILL TURNER: Jack Sparrow. He sent me to settle his debt.
DAVY JONES: Huh! Did he, now? I'm sorely tempted to accept that offer. 
[through a spyglass, Jack sees Jones turn to look directly at him] Black Pearl
[suddenly Jones is standing aboard the Black Pearl, directly in front of Jack and his spyglass]
[Cotton and Gibbs have knives to their throats from other Flying Dutchman crewmembers who teleported over]
JACK SPARROW: Oh.
DAVY JONES: You have a debt to pay. You've been captain of the Black Pearl for thirteen years. *That* was our agreement.
JACK SPARROW: Technically, I was only captain for two years, then I was viciously mutinied upon.
DAVY JONES: Then you were a poor captain, but a *captain* nonetheless! Have you not introduced yourself all these years as *Captain* Jack Sparrow? 
JACK SPARROW: You have my payment. One soul to serve on your ship is already over there.
DAVY JONES: One soul is not equal to another.
JACK SPARROW: Aha! So we've established my proposal is sound in principle, now we're just haggling over price. 
DAVY JONES: Price? Pttt!
JACK SPARROW: Just how many souls do you think my soul is worth?
DAVY JONES: One hundred souls, three days-uh.
JACK SPARROW: You're a diamond, mate. Send me back the boy, I'll get started right off. 
[Maccus blocks Jack from exiting]
DAVY JONES: I keep the boy. A good-faith payment. That leaves you only ninety-nine more to go. Ha ha! Ha ha! Ha ha! 
JACK SPARROW: Have you not met Will Turner? He's noble, heroic, *terrific* soprano. Worth at least four... maybe three and a half. And did I happen to mention... he's in love. With a girl. Due to be married. Betrothed. Dividing him from her and her from him... would only be half as cruel as actually allowing them be joined in holy matrimony. Aye?
DAVY JONES: I keep the boy. Ninety-nine souls-uh. But I wonder, Sparrow, can you live with this? Can you condemn an innocent man - a friend-uh - to a lifetime of servitude, in your name while you roam free?
JACK SPARROW: Yep! I'm good with it. Should we seal it in blood? I mean... mm-mm - ink?
[Jones grabs Jack's hand, resulting in a squishy sound]
JACK SPARROW: Uh!
DAVY JONES: Three days. Three days.
[Pintel whimpers, with a knife held to his neck from a crewmember of Jones' ship]
[Jack looks at his hand, it's covered with slime, but the black spot disappears under the effect of the slime]
JACK SPARROW: Oh, Mr. Gibbs.
GIBBS: Aye.
JACK SPARROW: Uh, I feel sullied and unusual. 
GIBBS: And how do you intend to harvest these ninety-nine souls in three days?
JACK SPARROW: Fortunately, he was mum as the condition in which these souls need be.
GIBBS: Ah... Tortuga!
JACK SPARROW: Tortuga.
Scene: Edinburgh Trader
[inside a cabin aboard the Edinburgh Trader, Captain Bellamy is throwing documents down on the table]
BELLAMY: It's an outrage. Port tariffs, berthing fees, *wharf* handling, and heaven help us, pilotage. Are we all to work for the East India Trading Company, then? 
QUARTERMASTER: I'm afraid, Sir... Tortuga is the only free port left in these waters.
BELLAMY: A *pirate* port is what you mean. Well, I'm sorry. An honest sailor is what I am. I make my living fair, and I sleep well each night, thank you.
[a white dress floats by the cabin window, outside]
BURSAR: S-S-Sir!
[they all rush to the window of the cabin and look out]
[they all see the dress float by the cabin window, on its second pass]
[one crewman gasps]
[the men go outside to see the dress that was floating by the window]
[the dress floats like a ghost, its left arm raised as if pointing]
BURSAR: She wants you to... do something. 
BELLAMY: She's tryna give a sign. 
[the dress sweeps over a lantern, knocking it over and part of the deck ignites]
BELLAMY: Over there! Look for a sign! 
[the crew rush to the railing and look out at the sea]
[Elizabeth, up on the mast overhead, sighs in exasperation]
QUARTERMASTER: Look there! There it is. There's the sign.
BURSAR: That's seaweed. 
QUARTERMASTER: S-Seaweed can be a sign.
BURSAR: Looks like entrails.  That would be a bad sign.
ELIZABETH SWANN: What's that over there?
[Elizabeth is now sitting on a platform on the deck behind the men, pointing at the deck where the lantern fell]
[the men at the railing turn around and look where Elizabeth is pointing]
[the fire burning on the desk spells out "Tortuga" in fiery letters] Tortuga
[men are tied up with ropes alongside a well, camera pans past the well]
[a man is tied up and being dunked in the well, and is spouting water from his mouth]
[crowded tavern, glass bottles are being shot off of people's heads for entertainment]
[a duo of musicians is playing a guitar and accordion]
GIBBS: And what makes you think you're worthy to crew the Black Pearl?
ELDERLY MAN: Truth be told, I never sailed a day in me life. I figure I should get out and see the world while I'm still young.
GIBBS: You'll do. Make your mark. Next!
JILTED MAN: My wife ran off with my dog. And I'm drunk for a month. And I don't give a ass rat's if I live or die.
GIBBS: Perfect! Next!
ONE-ARMED MAN: Me have one arm, 'n' a bum leg. 
GIBBS: It's the crow's nest for you.
[Jack is sitting alongside a wall, within earshot of Gibbs' table, trying to make his Compass work]
JACK SPARROW: I know what I want.
GIBBS: Next!
ROMANTIC MAN: Ever since I was a little lad, I've always wanted to sail the seas. Forever.
GIBBS: Sooner than you think. Sign the roster.
ROMANTIC MAN: Thanks very much.
JACK SPARROW: How we going?
GIBBS: Including those four? That gives us - four!
[to the next candidate in line]
GIBBS: And what's *your* story?
NORRINGTON: My story... it's exactly the same as your story, just one chapter behind. I chased a man across the Seven Seas. The pursuit cost me my crew, my commission, and my life. 
GIBBS: Commodore?
NORRINGTON: No, not anymore, weren't you *listening*? I nearly had you all, off Tripoli. I would have, if not for the... hurricane. 
GIBBS: Lord. You didn't try to sail through it?
NORRINGTON: So do I make your crew, or not? You haven't said where you're going. Somewhere *nice*! 
[unidentified woman] Oh!
[the music stops, everyone stares at the altercation]
[Jack grabs a branch from a vase, carries it in front of his face, attempts to walk out unseen] 
NORRINGTON: So am I *worthy* to serve under Captain Jack Sparrow?
[Norrington spots Jack sneaking off behind him, points a pistol at Jack]
NORRINGTON: Or should I just kill you now?
[Jack ducks back and forth behind both sides of a large post, as Norrington points his pistol at Jack]
JACK SPARROW: You're hired.
NORRINGTON: Sorry. Old habits and all that.
[unidentifed man, to Norrington] Easy, sonny!
[someone deflects Norrington's pistol upwards as it fires]
[the ball richochets off the chandelier, breaking a man's bottle as he's drinking from it]
[the man whose bottle broke slugs a man next to him]
[the music starts back up as a brawl ensues]
[one man swings from chandelier, women fight, bottles are thrown against the wall, etc.]
JACK SPARROW: Time to go?
GIBBS: Aye!
[a swordfight is going on]
[someone throws a bottle against the wall above the stairs, Jack ducks as it smashes above his head]
[Jack makes his way upstairs, trading hats a few times along the way]
JACK SPARROW: Thanks, mate.
[Jack slaps him on the shoulder, the man falls backwards off the balcony]
[Jack halts to let two men carrying another man proceed towards the edge of the balcony]
JACK SPARROW: Carry on. Heave!
[the two men throw the carried man off the balcony, then Jack continues on his way]
[the music stops, Norrington threateningly holds a bottle in his left hand]
NORRINGTON: Come on, men! Who wants some? Form an orderly line, I'll have you all one by one. Come on, who's first?
[from behind, Elizabeth grabs the bottle from Norrington, smashes it over his head, knocking him out]
ELIZABETH SWANN: I just wanted the pleasure of doing that myself! 
[the crowd cheers, and everyone holds up their mugs in a toast]
[men throw Norrington into the mud with some pigs, the crowd leaves except for Elizabeth]
[Elizabeth turns Norrington over, onto his back]
ELIZABETH SWANN: James Norrington. What has the world done to you?
[Mercer observes Elizabeth and Norrington from the doorway of the tavern] Flying Dutchman
[Jones plays his pipe organ with his tentacles, steam coming from pipes]
[the crew are on desk, slaving away, pulling rhythmically on a rope] Heave! Heave! Heave! Heave! Heave! Heave!
BO'SUN: Secure the mast tackle, Mister Turner!
BO'SUN: Step to-it/tight!
[Will goes to grab a rope]
WILL TURNER: Step aside!
BO'SUN: Regain-yourselves!/Mind-yourself!
Scene: ###
[Bootstrap sees that the other man at the rope is his son, Bootstrap is stunned]
[Bootstrap lets go of the rope, Will attempts to grab the sliding rope]
[the cannon's rope drags Will across the deck]
[the hoisted cannon crashes to the deck, and the organ music stops]
BO'SUN: Haul that weevil to his feet! 
[the crew haul Will to his feet]
BO'SUN: Five lashes to remind you... to stay on 'em! 
BO'SUN: Impeding me in my duties. You'll share the punishment.
DAVY JONES: Will you now? And what would prompt such an act of charity?
DAVY JONES: Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha! What fortuitous circumstance be this! Five lashes be owed. I believe it is.
[Jones hands the whip to Bootstrap, Jones' tentacle curls around the shaft of it]
DAVY JONES: The cat's out of the bag, Mister Turner. Your issue will feel its sting be it the Bo'sun's hand, by your own. 
DAVY JONES: Bo'sun!
[Bootstrap reluctantly takes the whip]
[two crewmen tear Will's shirt off, exposing his bare back]
[Bootstrap whips Will's back five times]
[Will is tossed into a lower part of the deck, partially filled with water]
[Will stands up, wearing an intact white shirt]
BO'SUN: You had it easy, boy! Ha ha ha!
WILL TURNER: I don't need your help!
WILL TURNER: So I'm to understand what *you* did was an act of compassion?
FLYING DUTCHMAN: below deck
[Bootstrap and Will enter the interior of the ship together]
[crewmember Wyvern is seen to their right, encrusted into the interior side of the hull, standing up]
WILL TURNER: I've sworn no oath.
WILL TURNER: Not until I find this. The key.
[Wyvern's eyes open in the coral-encrusted wall at the mention of the key]
[Wyvern, who is part of the wall, breaks his head away from the wall, leaving his brains behind]
WYVERN: The deadman's chest.
WILL TURNER: What do you know of this?
WYVERN: Open the chest with the key, and stab the heart. No-no-no-no. Don't stab the heart. The Dutchman needs a living heart, or there'll be no captain. And if there's no captain, there's no one to have the key. 
WILL TURNER: So the captain has the key.
[Wyvern retracts his head back into the wall, having said too much]
WILL TURNER: Where *is* the key?
WYVERN: Hidden.
WILL TURNER: Where is the chest?
WYVERN: Hidden.
[Wyvern closes his eyes, and falls silent]
Scene: Black Pearl
[the Black Pearl is at a dock, loading fruits and livestock]
[Jack and Gibbs are walking together, Elizabeth approaches from behind, still dressed as a man]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Captain Sparrow!
JACK SPARROW: Come to join me crew, lad? Welcome aboard.
ELIZABETH SWANN: I'm here to find the man I love.
JACK SPARROW: I'm deeply flattered, son, but my first and only love is the sea.
[Norrington vomits over the side] 
ELIZABETH SWANN: Meaning William Turner, Captain Sparrow.
JACK SPARROW: Elizabeth. Hide the rum.
[Gibbs takes the bottle that Jack hands to him, and walks up the boarding plank in the background]
JACK SPARROW: You know, these clothes do not flatter you at all. It should be a dress or nothing. I happen to have no dress in my cabin.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Jack. I know Will came to find you. Where is he?
JACK SPARROW: Darling, I am truly unhappy to have to tell you this but... through an unfortunate and *entirely* unforeseeable series of circumstances that have nothing whatsoever to do with me, poor William has been press-ganged into Davy Jones' crew.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Davy Jones?
[Norrington vomits over the side, then spits]
NORRINGTON: Oh, please. The captain of the Flying Dutchman.
JACK SPARROW: You look bloody awful. What are you doing here?
NORRINGTON: You *hired* me. I can't help it if your standards are lax.
JACK SPARROW: You *smell* funny.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Jack. All I want is to find Will.
JACK SPARROW: Are you certain? Is that what you really want most?
ELIZABETH SWANN: 'Course.
JACK SPARROW: Because I would think, you'd want to find a way to *save* Will the most.
ELIZABETH SWANN: And you have a way of doing that?
JACK SPARROW: Well, there is a chest...
NORRINGTON: Oh, dear.
JACK SPARROW: A chest of unknown size and origin.
[Pintel & Ragetti walk by, together carrying a crate of bottles, and overhearing the conversation]
PINTEL: What contains the still-beating heart o' Davy Jones.
RAGETTI: Unh-unh... unh-unh... unh-unh...
JACK SPARROW: And whoever possesses that chest possesses the leverage to command Jones to do whatever it is he or she wants, including... saving brave William from his grim fate.
NORRINGTON: You don't actually believe him, do you?
ELIZABETH SWANN: How do we find it?
JACK SPARROW: With this. My Compass... is unique.
NORRINGTON: "Unique" here having the meaning of broken.
JACK SPARROW: True enough. This Compass does not point north.
[Norrington vomits over the side]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Where does it point?
JACK SPARROW: It points to the thing you want most in this world.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Oh Jack! Are you telling the truth?
JACK SPARROW: Every word, love. And what you want most in this world is to find the chest of Davy Jones, is it not?
ELIZABETH SWANN: To save Will?
JACK SPARROW: By finding the chest of Davy Jones.
[Jack hands the compass to Elizabeth, then draws away quickly so as not to influence the compass]
[Elizabeth consults the compass, for her the dial clearly points in a specific direction]
[Jack slowly rises up to peer at the face of the compass]
JACK SPARROW: Mister Gibbs!
GIBBS: Cap'n.
JACK SPARROW: We have our heading.
GIBBS: Finally! Cast off those lines, weigh anchor, and prow that canvas!
JACK SPARROW: Miss Swann.
Scene: GIBBS###
PINTEL: Welcome to the crew, former Commodore! Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh...
[the goat neighs]
PORT ROYAL: EITC headquarters
[Beckett and Mercer are in a room with the governor, whose hands are in shackles]
[Mercer is looking through a mounted telescope to outside the window]
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: There's something to knowing the exact shape of the world and one's place in it, don't you agree?
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: I had you brought here because I thought you'd be interested in the whereabouts of your daughter.
MERCER: Most recently seen on the island of Tortuga, then left, in the company of a known pirate, Jack Sparrow. *And* other fugitives from justice.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Including the previous owner of this sword... I believe. Our ships are in pursuit. and justice will be dispensed by cannonade and cutlass, and all manner of remorseless pieces of metal. I personally find it distasteful to even contemplate the horror facing all those on board. 
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Your authority as governor, your influence in London, and your loyalty to the East India Trading Company.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Shall I remove these shackles?
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: So you see, Mercer, every man has a price he will willingly accept. Even for what he hopes never to sell.
FLYING DUTCHMAN: deck
[slow motion scene of falling dice]
[three crewman are playing Liar's Dice] 
[organ music is heard in the background]
MACCUS: I wager... ten years.
KOLENIKO: I'll match ten years.
GREENBEARD: Agreed.
WILL TURNER: I understand. Liar!
WILL TURNER: It's a game of deception. Your bet includes all the dice, not just your own.
WILL TURNER: What are they wagering?
WILL TURNER: So any crewman can be challenged?
WILL TURNER: I challenge Davy Jones.
[immediately the organ music ceases, immediately Jones' peg leg is heard thumping in approach]
[with each thump of his footstep, gooseneck barnacles retract]
[someone laughs]
DAVY JONES: I accept that-uh.
[Jones sits down at the gambling table]
DAVY JONES: The stakes?
WILL TURNER: My soul. An eternity of servitude.
DAVY JONES: Against?
WILL TURNER: I want this.
[Jack shows Jones the picture of the key]
DAVY JONES: How do you know of the key?
WILL TURNER: That's not part of the game, is it? You can still walk away.
[One of Jones' tentacles pulls out the key from his vest to display it]
[the tentacle puts the key back]
[Bootstrap sits down at the table]
DAVY JONES: What's this?
WILL TURNER: No! Don't do this.
DAVY JONES: Four fours.
WILL TURNER: Four fives.
DAVY JONES: Seven fives-uh.
WILL TURNER: Eight fives.
DAVY JONES: Huh huh huh. Welcome to the crew, liar. 
DAVY JONES: And be called a liar myself for my trouble? Bootstrap Bill, you're a liar and you will spend an eternity on this ship! Master Turner, feel free to go ashore... the very next time we make port! 
WILL TURNER: Fool. Why did you do that?
WILL TURNER: It was never about winning, or losing.
FLYING DUTCHMAN: organ room
[nighttime on deck of the Flying Dutchman]
[Will emerges from a hatch on deck]
[Will sneaks past one one the crew on deck, who is sleeping with a bottle in his hand]
[Jones is asleep at his organ, snoring]
[Will sneaks into his room, behind him]
[Will grabs a nearby quill pen, uses it to lift one of Jones' tentacles]
[one tentacle accidentally falls on an organ key, almost waking up Jones]
[the falling tentacle also sets off a locket on top of the organ, that plays a song]
[Will holds one of the staves in his mouth while lifting the tentacles]
[Will finally removes the key, replaces it with his drawing of the key]
FLYING DUTCHMAN: deck
WILL TURNER: It's not a fate you had to choose for yourself, either.
WILL TURNER: They'll know you helped me.
WILL TURNER: I take this with a promise. I'll find a way to sever Jones' hold on you. And not rest until this blade pierces his heart. I will not abandon you. I promise.
[Will sets out alone on a longboat]
Scene: Black Pearl
[crewmen are scrubbing the deck of the Black Pearl]
GIBBS: Beckett!
ELIZABETH SWANN: Yes, they're signed, Lord Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Company.
JACK SPARROW: Agh.
GIBBS: Will was working for Beckett, and never said a word.
JACK SPARROW: Agh.
GIBBS: Beckett wants the Compass. Only one reason for that.
JACK SPARROW: Of course. He wants the chest.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Yes, he did say something about a chest.
GIBBS: If the company controls the chest, they controls the sea.
JACK SPARROW: A truly discomforting notion, love.
GIBBS: And bad. Bad for every mother's son what calls himself a pirate. I think there's a bit more speed to be coaxed from these sails. Brace the foreyard!
JACK SPARROW: Might I inquire how as to how you came by these? 
ELIZABETH SWANN: Persuasion.
JACK SPARROW: Friendly?
ELIZABETH SWANN: Decidedly not.
JACK SPARROW: Will strikes a deal for these and upholds it with honor. Yet you're the one standing here with the prize. Full pardon, commission as a privateer on behalf of England and the East India Trading Company. As if I could be bought for such a low price. 
[Jack tucks the Letters into his coat and begins to walk away]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Jack, the Letters, give them back.
JACK SPARROW: No. Persuade me.
ELIZABETH SWANN: You do know Will taught me how handle a sword. 
JACK SPARROW: As I said... Persuade me.
[Elizabeth walks away frustrated, leans on the ship's railing]
[Jack makes an odd grunting noise]
[Norrington walks up to Elizabeth at the railing]
NORRINGTON: It's a curious thing. There was a time when I would've given anything for you to look like that while thinking about me.
ELIZABETH SWANN: I don't know what you mean.
NORRINGTON: Oh, I think you do.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Oh, don't be absurd. I trust him, that's all.
NORRINGTON: So you never wondered how your *latest* fiancé ended up on the Flying Dutchman in the first place? Edinburgh Trader
BELLAMY: Strange thing to come upon a longboat so far out in open waters. 
WILL TURNER: Just put as many leagues behind us as you can. As fast as you can.
BELLAMY: And what are we running from?
[Will sees Elizabeth's white wedding dress on a chair in the cabin]
WILL TURNER: That dress. Where did you get it?
BELLAMY: It was found aboard the ship. The crew it thought it was a spirit bringing some omen of ill fate.
WILL TURNER: That's foolish.
QUARTERMASTER: Oh, yes. Proceededly foolish.
BURSAR: It brought good fortune! The spirit told us... Put in at Tortuga. And we made a nice bit of profit there.
BELLAMY: Off the books, of course. 
WILL TURNER: I imagine... some of your crew may have jumped ship there.
BELLAMY: Why do you ask?
MESSENGER SAILOR: Captain, a ship's been spotted. 
BELLAMY: Colors?
MESSENGER SAILOR: She isn't flyin' any.
BELLAMY: Pirates!
WILL TURNER: Or worse.
FLYING DUTCHMAN: deck
[Jones is on deck, having found the cloth that Will swapped for the key]
[Bootstrap is held at knife point on board the Flying Dutchman]
[one crewman holds a sawfish sword as a restraining weapon in front of Bootstrap] 
DAVY JONES: You will watch this.
[crewmen are whipped, in order to turn a large screw that raises the Kraken summoning device]
DAVY JONES: Let no joyful voice be heard! Let no man look up at the sky with hope! And let this day be cursed by we who ready to wake... the *Kraken*!
[the Kraken calling device thumps heavily against the sea]
Scene: Edinburgh Trader
[crewmen on board the Edinburgh Trader rush to the railing, chattering, to see the Flying Dutchman]
[Will is on top of the mast]
WILL TURNER: I've doomed us all. It's the Flying Dutchman!
[a loud thumping sound resonates throughout the ship]
BURSAR: Oh, Mother Cary's chickens. What happened? 
QUARTERMASTER: Must've hit a reef.
[the crew look overboard, see bubbles rising up alongside the ship]
BELLAMY: Free the rudder! Hard to port, then hard to starboard! Clear the rudder! Hard to port!
[a Kraken tentacle silently seizes one crewman while other crewmembers have their backs turned]
[the Kraken tentacle surfaces in the distance, holding the crewman who was just seized, he screams] *Kraken!*
[crewman rings the ship's bell wildly]
Scene: ###
[music stops, slow motion scene, a huge tentacle rises high over the ship]
[the tentacle comes down on deck, breaking the ship in two, bouncing men off the deck]
[slow motion scene, men slide off of tilted deck]
[Will is flung underwater, sees the body of the Kraken in the distance underwater]
[Will surfaces, climbs aboard a floating board of ship debris]
[the Flying Dutchman comes near Will, Will slides off his board to swim towards the ship]
[view from the bow of the Flying Dutchman, looking at the floating debris, including a face-down corpse]
[Elizabeth's wedding dress is also debris, and floats on the surface of the sea]
FLYING DUTCHMAN: deck
MACCUS: The boy's not here. He must've been claimed by the sea.
DAVY JONES: *I* am the sea.
[Jones stomps over to Bootstrap]
DAVY JONES: You need time alone with your thoughts. What of the survivors?
DAVY JONES: There are no survivors.
[the remaining crewmen are simultanenously axed from behind]
[Will witnesses the axing, ducks behind a beam]
[Jones turns around, sensing Will, but sees nothing]
DAVY JONES: The chest is no longer safe. Chart a course to Isla Cruces. Get me there first, or there'll be the devil to pay. 
KOLENIKO: First?
DAVY JONES: Who sent that thieving charlatan onto my ship? Who told them of the key? Jack Sparrow.
[camera shows Will hitching a ride on the front of the Flying Dutchman, between the jaw formations]
[Elizabeth's wedding dress is shown underwater, sinking into the depths of the sea] Black Pearl
[Elizabeth is sitting on some steps on deck of the Black Pearl]
[Jack walks over to her, holding a bottle of rum]
JACK SPARROW: My tremendous intuitive sense of the female creature informs me that you are troubled.
ELIZABETH SWANN: I just thought I'd be married by now. I'm so ready to be married. 
[Jack offers Elizabeth a drink from his bottle]
JACK SPARROW: You know... Lizzy... I *am*... captain of a ship. And *being* captain of a ship, I could in fact perform a... marriage. Right here. Right on this deck. Right... *now*! 
[Elizabeth recoils at Jack's breath on the word "now"]
ELIZABETH SWANN: No, thank you.
JACK SPARROW: Why not? We *are* very much alike, you and I. I and you. Us.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Oh. Except for a sense of honor, and decency and-and a moral center. And personal hygiene.
[Jack smells his armpits]
JACK SPARROW: Trifles. You *will* come over to my side, I know it.
ELIZABETH SWANN: You seem very certain.
JACK SPARROW: One word love: curiosity. You long for freedom. You long to do what you want to do because you want it. To act on selfish impulse. You want to see what it's like. One day, you won't be able to resist.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Why doesn't your Compass work? 
JACK SPARROW: Uh my Compass works fine. 
ELIZABETH SWANN: Because you and I *are* alike, and there will come a moment when you have a chance to show it. To do the right thing.
JACK SPARROW: I *love* those moments. I like to wave at them as they pass by.
ELIZABETH SWANN: You'll have the chance to do something... something courageous. And when you do, you'll discover something: that you're a good man.
JACK SPARROW: All evidence to the contrary.
ELIZABETH SWANN: I have faith in you. Want to know why?
JACK SPARROW: Do tell, dearie.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Curiosity. You're going to want it. A chance to be admired. And gain the rewards that follow. You won't be able to resist. You're going to want to know... what it tastes like.
JACK SPARROW: I *do* want to know what it tastes like.
ELIZABETH SWANN: But - seeing as you're a good man I know you will *never* put me in a position that would compromise my honor.
[Jack stares in horror as the black spot boils back into view on his hand, Elizabeth doesn't notice]
ELIZABETH SWANN: I'm proud of you, Jack.
GIBBS: Land ho!
JACK SPARROW: I want my jar of dirt. 
Scene: Longboat
[Pintel and Ragetti are rowing a longboat with key members of the crew inside]
[Jack in the bow, Elizabeth and Norrington are in the back]
PINTEL: You're pullin' too fast.
RAGETTI: You're pulling too slow. We don't want the Kraken to catch us.
PINTEL: I'm savin' me strength for when it comes. And I don't think it's Krack-en, anyways. I always heard it said Kray-kin. 
RAGETTI: What, with a long A? 
PINTEL: Aye.
RAGETTI: No-no-no-no-no-no-no. Krock-en's how it's pronounced in the original Scandinavian, and Krack-en's closer to that. 
PINTEL: Well we ain't original Scandinavians, are we? Kray-ken!
RAGETTI: It's a mythological creature, I can calls it what I wants.
ISLA CRUCES: beach
[their longboat arrives at the beach, Jack disembarks and begins to walk off]
JACK SPARROW: Guard the boat, mind the tide... Don't touch my dirt.
[Elizabeth is walking in some sand dunes near the beach, using the compass]
ELIZABETH SWANN: This doesn't work. And it *certainly* doesn't show you what you want most.
[Elizabeth sits down on the sand, and sets the compass down on the sand, the needle points to her]
JACK SPARROW: Yes it *does*. You're sitting on it! 
ELIZABETH SWANN: Beg your pardon?
JACK SPARROW: Move. 
[they start digging under where Elizabeth was sitting]
[Pintel and Ragetti are by the boat, clowning around, Ragetti is balancing a shovel on one hand]
PINTEL: "Mind the tide." 
RAGETTI: I can/may join the circus!
PINTEL: Don't mind if I shine your shoes, Sir?
FLYING DUTCHMAN: deck
[Jones is watching Pintel and Ragetti on the beach through a spyglass]
DAVY JONES: They're here. And I cannot step foot on land again for near of a decade. 
MACCUS: Then trust us to act in your stead.
DAVY JONES: I'll trust you know what awaits should you *fail*! Down, then!
[ugly, nondescript crewmember] Down!
MACCUS: Down!
[view from the deck of the Flying Dutchman as it submerges, some underwater footage]
[Pintel and Ragetti are astounded to see the ship submerge in the distance, Ragetti's balanced shovel falls]
[Pintel and Ragetti run off to warn the others]
Scene: ###!
ISLA CRUCES: beach
[Norrington is digging in the sand, Jack sits in a lotus position nearby on a sandy slope] 
[while digging, Norrington's shovel hits something hard, they brush off sand to reveal a chest]
[they remove the chest from the sand]
[the chest contains a pearl necklace, documents, and a smaller chest, among other things]
[Elizabeth opens up a letter with a wax seal, and reads it to herself]
[they all bend near to put their ears to the small chest, and they hear a heartbeat]
ELIZABETH SWANN: It's real!
NORRINGTON: You actually *were* telling the truth.
JACK SPARROW: I do that quite a lot. Yet people are always surprised.
WILL TURNER: With good reason!
[Will has unexpectedly appeared on the beach, walking up toward them] 
ELIZABETH SWANN: Will! You're alright! Thank God! I came to find you!
[Will and Elizabeth kiss]
JACK SPARROW: How did you get here?
WILL TURNER: Sea turtles, mate. A pair of them, strapped to my feet.
JACK SPARROW: Not so easy, is it?
WILL TURNER: But I do owe you thanks, Jack.
JACK SPARROW: You do?
WILL TURNER: After you tricked me onto that ship to square your debt with Jones.
ELIZABETH SWANN: What?
JACK SPARROW: What?
WILL TURNER: I was reunited with my father.
JACK SPARROW: Oh! Well... you're welcome, then.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Everything you said to me... every word, was a lie!
JACK SPARROW: Pretty much. Time and tide, love. 
[Will stoops down with the key to open the chest]
JACK SPARROW: Oy! What're you doing?
WILL TURNER: I'm gonna kill Jones.
[Jack draws his sword, points it at Will]
JACK SPARROW: Can't let you do that, William. 'Cause if Jones is dead, who's to call his terrible beastie off the hunt, eh? Now. If you please: The key.
[Will backs up slowly, then suddenly draws Elizabeth's sword, points it at Jack]
WILL TURNER: I keep the promises I make, Jack. I intend to free my father. I hope you're here to see it.
[Norrington draws his sword, points it at Will]
NORRINGTON: I can't let you do that, either. So sorry.
JACK SPARROW: I knew you'd warm up to me eventually.
[Norrington points his sword at Jack]
NORRINGTON: Lord Beckett desires the contents of that chest. I deliver it, and get my life back.
JACK SPARROW: Ah. The dark side of ambition.
NORRINGTON: Oh, I prefer to see it as the promise of redemption.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Stop it! Be careful!
[various dueling interjections]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Jack!
WILL TURNER: Guard the chest!
[duel halts for a second]
ELIZABETH SWANN: *No*!
[duel resumes]
ELIZABETH SWANN: This is bar-*baric*! This is *no* way for grown men to settle - ! Oh! Fine! Let's just - *pull* out our swords and start *banging* away at each other! *This will solve everything!* I've had it! I've had enough! Wobbly-legged, rum-soaked... *pirates*! 
[Elizabeth throws a rock at the duelists, but the rock goes far to the left of them]
PINTEL: How'd this go all screwy? Enough!
RAGETTI: Well, each wants the chest for hisself, don't 'e? Mister Norrington, I think he's tryna regain a bit of honor. Old Jack's lookin' to trade it, save his own skin. And Turner there - I figure 'e's tryna... settle some unresolved business 'twixt him and his twice-cursed pirate father. 
PINTEL: Sad. That chest must be worth more 'n a shiny penny. 
RAGETTI: Oh! Tsk-tsk-tsk. Terrible temptation.
PINTEL: If we was any kind of *decent*, we'd remove temptation from their path.
[Pintel and Ragetti giggle and run off to steal the small chest]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Will! *Enough!*
[Elizabeth is panting from exasperation and exhaustion]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Oh! Oh...! The heat!
[Elizabeth pretends to faint, which knocks off her hat]
[Elizabeth watches sideways as the duelists continue fighting, oblivious to her]
[Elizabeth soon sits up, puts on her hat]
[Pintel & Ragetti run by in the distance behind her, with the chest]
[Elizabeth sees Pintel & Ragetti, and goes to chase them]

[Norrington chases Jack up steps inside the building, Jack kicks Norrington back down with his foot] 
[Jack and Norrington have a swordfight on the inside steps]
[Jack grabs hold of the bell rope, which carries him downward, and carries Will upward, who just arrived]
WILL TURNER: By *your* leave, Mister Norrington.
[the Flying Dutchman crew on shore are at the large chest and look up to the ringing bell in the building on the hill]
[while Norrington and Will are dueling on top of the roof, Jack deftly grabs the dangling key away from Norrington's hand]
[noticing the key gone, Norrington then turns and duels with Jack]
[soon Norrington knocks Jack's sword from Jack's hand, the sword is flung onto the ground below]
NORRINGTON: Do excuse me while I kill the man who ruined my life.
WILL TURNER: Be my guest.
JACK SPARROW: Let us examine that claim for a moment, former Commodore, shall we? Who was it, who at the very moment you had a notorious pirate safely behind bars, saw fit to *free* said pirate, and take your dearly beloved all to hisself, hey? So who's fault is it, *really*, that you've ended up a rum-pot deckhand what takes orders from pirates?
NORRINGTON: Enough!
[Jack somersaults off the roof to escape, Norrington turns to Will]
NORRINGTON: Unfortunately, Mister Turner... He's *right*!
[Norrington and Will resume their part of the rooftop duel]
JACK SPARROW: Still rooting for you, mate!
[Jack picks up his sword from the ground, and puts the key around his neck]
[Jack walks through a graveyard, falls into an open grave] 
JACK SPARROW: Wup!
[Jack stands up in the bottom of the hole]
JACK SPARROW: Oh.
[Norrington backs Will onto the top of the mill's waterwheel]
[the axle of the wheel breaks off with Norrington and Jack dueling on top]
[Jack is facing the other direction, so is unaware of the freed wheel rolling behind him]
[the wheel crashes through a small fence, turns, and rolls directly towards Jack]
[the waterwheel rolls over Jack, and Jack is pulled into the inside of the wheel]
JACK SPARROW: Woah!
[the key that Jack had around his neck falls off into the wheel]
[Jack struggles to grab the key, which is caught and dangling inside the rolling wheel]
[Jack finally grabs the key, but hits his head on a metal bar inside the wheel, and falls off the wheel] 
[Pintel & Ragetti are running off with the small chest, each holding one side, giggling]
[Elizabeth steps in front Pintel & Ragetti, confronting them, halts, panting]
[Pintel & Ragetti drop the chest, pull their swords on Elizabeth]
[Elizabeth reaches for her sword, but it's gone] 
PINTEL: 'Ello, Poppet.
[Pintel & Ragetti slowly advance on Elizabeth, she slowly retreats while facing them]
[they all pause for a moment to watch the wheel roll by with the duel on top]
[Jack is running behind the wheel, trying to catch up and get the key that is still inside]
[Pintel shrugs, Pintel and Ragetti resume advancing on Elizabeth]
[suddenly a thrown axe embeds itself in a coconut palm next to Elizabeth]
[all three turn to see Jones' crew crashing through the bushes toward them]

[a sword is thrown to Pintel, just in time]
RAGETTI: Sword!
[a sword is thrown to Ragetti, just in time]
[Jack sees Hadrus running alone through the palms, carrying the small chest]
[Jack picks up a coconut, whirls it a moment, then throws it at Hadrus]
[Hadrus' (conch shell) head is knocked off by the coconut]
[Hadrus' head lies on the ground, attempting to give orders to the rest of his body to find the head]
HADRUS: Aya! Uh seech! Aunido! Aunido! Follow my voice! Follow my voice! To the left, uh... No, to the right... Go to the left... 
[Hadrus' headless body walks into a coconut palm]
HADRUS: No... That's a tree.
JACK SPARROW: Oh, shut it.
[Jack unlocks the small chest with the key, square security bolts suddenly protrude when opened]
[the heart is inside, beating]
[crewmen of the Flying Dutchman approach, Jack tucks the heart into his vest]
[Elizabeth uses two swords together, one in each hand, to stab backwards and kill two attacking crewmen]
ISLA CRUCES: beach
[Jack is the first to arrive back at the longboat on the beach]
JACK SPARROW: Jar of dirt!
[Jack opens his jar of dirt, dumps out some dirt, puts the heart in the jar, scoops handfuls of dirt back into the jar]

[Pintel & Ragetti grab a fishnet and oar as weapons against Will]
PINTEL: Come on, Turner!
[Jack fights with Koleniko, using an oar, subdues him]
[Will sees the key in the chest, Jack notices Will looking at the key and chest]
[Jack hits Will on the head with the our, which knocks him out]
JACK SPARROW: Leave him lie! Unless you plan on using him to hit something with.
ELIZABETH SWANN: We're not getting out of this.
NORRINGTON: Not with the chest. Into the boat. 
[Norrington takes the chest]
ELIZABETH SWANN: You're mad.
NORRINGTON: Don't wait for me.
JACK SPARROW: Uh, I say we respect his final wish.
PINTEL: Aye! 
[the remaining Black Pearl crew escape by longboat]
[Hadrus is holding his conch shell head under one arm, the head speaks to Norrington]
HADRUS: Your bravery is wasted. I shall pry the chest away from your cold... dead... hands.
[Norrington pauses, looks around]
NORRINGTON: Here you go! 
HADRUS: Oo!
[Norrington flees, Hadrus drops his head onto the ground when catching the chest]
[Hadrus' crewmates laugh and walk off with Hadrus' body, ignoring Hadrus' head]
HADRUS: Uh! Ando! Aunido! Aunido! Pirates!
[the face inside Hadrus' head turns around, turns into a hermit crab, extends its legs]
[the hermit crab head crawls after its departing body and crew]
HADRUS: Vengo kowmpenay lachay. Hey! Hovaya! Black Pearl
[Will, lying flat on the deck, head over a grate, returns to consciousness aboard the Black Pearl]
WILL TURNER: What happened to the chest?
ELIZABETH SWANN: Norrington took it to draw them off.
PINTEL: You're pulling too hard!
RAGETTI: You're not pulling hard enough!
GIBBS: Where's the Commodore?
JACK SPARROW: He fell behind.
GIBBS: My prayers be with him. Best not wallow in our grief. The bright side is: You're back. And made it off free and clear.
[the Flying Dutchman suddenly surfaces alongside them]
GIBBS: Lord almighty.us.
JACK SPARROW: I'll handle this, mate.
JACK SPARROW: Hey! Fishface! Lose something? Hey? Oup!
[Jack falls down the stairs of the Pearl, crew says "Ooh!"]
JACK SPARROW: Got it! 
[Jack stands up, struts across the deck, holding his jar of dirt]
JACK SPARROW: Come to negotiate, eh, have you, you slimy git? Look what I got. I got a jar of dirt! I got a jar of dirt! And guess what's inside it?
DAVY JONES: Enough!
[the Flying Dutchman's cannon covers slide down, cannons emerge from the holes]
JACK SPARROW: Hard to starboard.
ELIZABETH SWANN: *Hard to starboard!*
WILL TURNER: Brace up the foreyard! 
GIBBS: Hard to starboard!
DAVY JONES: Send his beloved Pearl back to the depths! Fire!
[a heavy cannonade fires from the Flying Dutchman, blowing large holes in the Black Pearl]
[Pintel and Ragetti look through the gaping hole in the stern, see the Flying Dutchman following them]
PINTEL: She's on us! She's on us!
DAVY JONES: Let them taste the triple guns.
[cage-faced crewmember] Aye, Captain.
[triple-barreled cannon fires, barrel rotates after each blast] 
DAVY JONES: Come on, ###!
ELIZABETH SWANN: She's falling behind!
GIBBS: Aye, and we've got her!
WILL TURNER: We're the faster?
GIBBS: Against the wind the Dutchman beats us. That's how she takes her prey. But *with* the wind...
WILL TURNER: We rob her advantage.
GIBBS: Ah!
FLYING DUTCHMAN: deck
DAVY JONES: They're out of range! Break out run ### We giving up, Sir?
[crewmen of the Flying Dutchman are whipped to raise the Kraken calling device]
Scene: BLACK PEARL
MARTY: They're giving up! Yay!
[crew cheers]
WILL TURNER: My father is *on* that ship. If we can outrun her, we can take her. We should turn and fight. 
JACK SPARROW: Why fight when you can negotiate? All one needs... is the proper leverage.
[suddenly the Black Pearl is badly jarred]
[Jack's jar of dirt falls to the deck, breaks open, spills all the dirt]
[Jack runs down to the spilled dirt, searches frantically for the heart, which is gone]
JACK SPARROW: Where is it? Where is the thump-thump? We must've hit the reef! 
WILL TURNER: No. It's not a reef! Get away from the rail!
ELIZABETH SWANN: What is it?
WILL TURNER: The Kraken. To arms!
GIBBS: All guns, defend the masts! 
WILL TURNER: It'll attack the starboard. I've seen it before. Break out the cannons and hold for my signal. 
[with a deep rumbling sound, the Kraken's tentacles slowly crawl up the hull]
WILL TURNER: Easy, boys!
ELIZABETH SWANN: Will?
[the tentacles rise higher]
WILL TURNER: Steady! Steady.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Will?
[the tentacles start feeling around the ship]
WILL TURNER: Hold. Hold...
PINTEL: I think we've held fire long enough.
ELIZABETH SWANN: *Will?*
WILL TURNER: *Fire...*!
[the crew fire the cannons, hitting the tentacles and nearly severing some]
[the Kraken sinks into the sea, some tentacles glowing from the blast]
[the crew cheers]
WILL TURNER: It'll be back. We have to get off the ship.
ELIZABETH SWANN: There's no boats.
[Will sees the wrecked boats, then sets his eyes on the barrels of gunpowder]
WILL TURNER: Pull the grates! Get all the gunpowder onto the net in the cargo hold.
[hands Elizabeth a long gun]
WILL TURNER: Whatever you do, don't miss.
ELIZABETH SWANN: As soon as you're clear.
[the crew is busy loading barrels of gunpowder from the hold] We are short stocked on gunpowder. Six barrel/below.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Bring it up!
GIBBS: There's only half a dozen kegs of powder!
WILL TURNER: Then load the rum!
[Gibbs seems shocked, then turns to see the entire crew halted, staring at him in shocked silence]
GIBBS: Aye! The rum, too!
[the crew continues loading]
[aerial view approaching Black Pearl, zooming through the rigging to the other side]
[Jack is in a rowboat alone, rowing away from the Black Pearl]
[Jack stops rowing, sees the Kraken with tentacles around Black Pearl in the distance]
[Jack looks back into the direction he's headed, then consults his Compass]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Step to!
[Elizabeth runs to the railing, sees Jack rowing away]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Oh you coward!
[another heavy thud hits the ship, crewmen shout]
MARTY: Not good.
[the Kraken attacks again]
WILL TURNER: Pull away!
GIBBS: Heave! Heave like you're being paid for it!
[Pintel & Ragetti stand to one side of a cannon port as a tentacle pulls one crewmember through sideways]
[Will hangs onto the side of the net of gunpowder barrels, attempting to attract the Kraken's attention]
WILL TURNER: Euh! Come on!I'm over here! Come on!
[Will slashes at tentacles with his sword]
WILL TURNER: Shoot! Elizabeth, shoot!
[Elizabeth hesitates, waiting for Will to fall free]
[one of the Kraken's tentacles wrap around her leg and drag her backwards, she screams]
[Ragetti chops off the end of the tentacle holding Elizabeth]
[Another crewmember picks up the rifle and attempts to shoot, only to be grabbed by the Kraken and flung around]
[the rifle drops onto the deck above Elizabeth]
[Elizabeth tries to pick up the fallen rifle, but someone's foot holds it down]
[she sees that it's Jack's foot, that he has returned to the Pearl]
[Jack picks up the rifle and takes aim at the gunpowder]
[slow motion scene of Jack firing a ball into the gunpowder]
[ball whistles through the air, strikes the gunpowder, which explodes]
[the Kraken releases its hold, burned tentacles withdraw into the ocean, groaning sound]
MARTY: Did we kill it?
GIBBS: No. We just made it angry. We're not out of this yet. Captain! Orders!
JACK SPARROW: Abandon ship. Into the longboat.
GIBBS: Jack! The Pearl!
JACK SPARROW: She's only a ship, mate.
ELIZABETH SWANN: He's right, we have to head for land.
PINTEL: 'S a lot o' open wa'er.
RAGETTI: That's a lot o' wa'er.
WILL TURNER: We have to try. We can get away as it takes down the Pearl.
GIBBS: Abandon ship. Abandon ship or abandon hope.
[the crew get ready to leave the Pearl, loading supplies and guns]
[Elizabeth approaches Jack]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Thank you, Jack.
JACK SPARROW: We're not free yet, love.
ELIZABETH SWANN: You came back. I always knew you were a good man.
[Elizabeth passionately kisses Jack] 
[Will sees the kiss from the longboat, falters]
GIBBS: Prepare to cast off! There's no time to lose! Come on, Will, step to!
[the kiss is inturrupted by the sound of shackles, Elizabeth has chained Jack to the main mast]
ELIZABETH SWANN: It's after you, not the ship. It's not us. This is the only way, don't you see? I'm not sorry.
[Elizabeth leans in as if to kiss him again.]
JACK SPARROW: Pirate. 
[Elizabeth leaves Jack and climbs down into the long boat]
WILL TURNER: Where's Jack?
ELIZABETH SWANN: He elected to stay behind to give us a chance.
[the crew look uncertain]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Go!
[the longboat casts off]
[Jack struggles with his manacles]
JACK SPARROW: Bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger...!
[a coconut and cannonball roll by, on the tilted deck]
[Jack spots a fallen lantern, picks it up with the tip of his sword]
[Jack breaks the lantern against the mast, pours oil over his wrists]
[Jack struggles with slipping his hand out]
JACK SPARROW: Come on... Come on...
[Jack finally manages to slip his hands out]
[the Kraken rises up behind him]
[Jack halts, turns around, faces the Kraken]
[music and sound stop momentarily]
[the Kraken roars, spraying Jack with slime and flinging his earlier-eaten hat to the deck]
JACK SPARROW: Not so bad.
[Jack spots his old hat lying next to his feet]
JACK SPARROW: Oh!
[Jack spots his hat, picks it up, puts it on, wipes slime from his face]
JACK SPARROW: Hello, beastie.
[slow motion scene of Jack boldy charging toward the Kraken's mouth, sword drawn] [Q3] 
FLYING DUTCHMAN: deck
DAVY JONES: Jack Sparrow. Our debt is settled. 
KOLENIKO: The captain goes down with his ship.
MACCUS: Turns out not even Jack Sparrow can best the devil.
DAVY JONES: Open the chest. Open the chest, I need to see it!
[the chest is opened, side view as Jones looks in, his face quivers]
[downwards view, showing that the chest is empty, Jones tilts his head back and shouts]
DAVY JONES: Damn you, Jack Spar-*row*!
PORT ROYAL: EITC headquarters
MERCER: The last of our ships has returned.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Is there any news on the chest?
MERCER: None. But... one of the ships did pick up a man adrift at sea. He had these.
[Mercer drops the Letters of Marque on Beckett's desk]
[Beckett opens the letter to look at it before looking up at Norrington, who has been standing in the office] 
NORRINGTON: I took the liberty of filling in my name.
[from his desk, Beckett beckons Norrington with two fingers]
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: If you intend to claim these, then you must have something to trade. D'you have the Compass?
NORRINGTON: Better. The heart of Davy Jones.
BAYOU: Tia's shack
[the remaining crew paddles through the waters to Tia Dalma's shack] 
[many natives stand in the waters surrounding the shack, holding candles, mourning Jack Sparrow]
[inside the shack, Will absent-mindedly keeps throwing his father's knife into the table top]
[Tia carries a tray around to all of them, offers the mugs to Elizabeth]
TIA DALMA: Against de cold... and de sorrow.
[Elizabeth takes a mug but doesn't drink] 
TIA DALMA: It's a shame. I know you're t'inking that wid the Pearl, you coulda captured the devil and set free your fadder's soul.
WILL TURNER: Doesn't matter now. The Pearl's gone. Along with its captain.
[Gibbs is standing in the doorway on the side of the shack]
GIBBS: Aye. And already the world seems a bit less bright. He fooled us all right to the end. But I guess that honest streak finally won out. To Jack Sparrow!
RAGETTI: Never another like Captain Jack.
PINTEL: He was a gentleman of fortune, he was.
ELIZABETH SWANN: He was a good man.
[they all take a drink out of their mugs, except Elizabeth]
WILL TURNER: If there was anything could be done to bring him back... Elizabeth...
TIA DALMA: Would you do it? Hmmm? What... would you? Hmmm? What would *any* of you be willing to do? Hmmm? Would you sail to the ends of the eart', and beyond, to fetch back witty Jack and 'im precious Pearl? 
GIBBS: Aye.
PINTEL: Aye.
RAGETTI: Aye.
COTTON'S PARROT: Awk! Aye.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Yes.
WILL TURNER: Aye.
TIA DALMA: Alright. But if you're goin' brave de weird, and haunted shores, at world's end, den... you will need a captain who knows dose waters. 
[a man wearing boots descends the stairs into the room]
BARBOSSA: So tell me, what's become of my ship? 
[Barbossa bites into a green apple, juice dripples down his chin]
[Jack the monkey on Barbossa's left shoulder faces the camera and snarls]
