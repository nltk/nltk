IRAN WARNS U.S. AGAINST RAISING TENSION IN GULF
  Iran warned the United States on Monday
  against exacerbating the Gulf crisis, saying it would endanger
  American interests.
      Tehran Radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting
  Corporation, said a spokesman for Iran's War Information
  Headquarters was responding "to U.S. Officials' remarks about
  taking military action against Iran."
      The radio also quoted an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
  as saying Iran would respond decisively to any aggressive
  measure by the United States.
      The radio said the spokesman made the statement "following
  the attack on a Kuwaiti ship under the U.S. Flag and comments
  by American officials on carrying out retaliatory action
  against Iran."
      The spokesman said, "Any U.S. Military aggression against
  Iran will certainly be the beginning of an extensive clash in
  the Persian Gulf, and amidst this our principled policy is to
  confront any act which escalates tension."
