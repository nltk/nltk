IRAN SAYS US ATTACK INVOLVES IT IN FULL-SCALE WAR
  A top Iranian military official said
  America's attack on an Iranian oil platform on Monday had
  involved the United States in full-scale war and Iran would
  avenge it with a "crushing blow."
      "The United States has entered a swamp from which it can in
  no way get out safely," the Iranian news agency IRNA quoted the
  head of Iran's war information headquarters as saying.
      The official, Kamal Kharrazi, said Washington had now
  become involved in what he called a full-fledged war with Iran.
      It was the first official Iranian reaction to the attack by
  four U.S. Navy destroyers on the Reshadat oil platform.
