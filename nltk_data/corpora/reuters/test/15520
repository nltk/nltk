U.S. ENERGY FUTURES CALLED UNCHANGED TO LOWER
  Traders expect U.S. energy futures will
  open unchanged to slightly lower this morning with support near
  yesterday's lows.
      Crude futures are called unchanged to five cts weaker
  tracking unchanged domestic crudes and North Sea Brent crude,
  which traded at 18.01 dlrs a barrel today, about ten cts below
  yesterday's New York close.
      Traders said the supply squeeze in 15-day forward April
  Brent appears to have ended.
      Product futures, which fell sharply yesterday, are due to
  open unchanged to 0.25 cent lower, traders said.
      Traders expect some followthrough selling in products but
  said gasoil futures in London will probably lend some support
  since they are trading as expected. May gasoil futures were off
  1.50 dlrs a tonne this morning while June was down 1.25 dlrs in
  thin conditions.
