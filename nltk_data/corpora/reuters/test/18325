AMOCO &lt;AN> SAYS DOME &lt;DMP> BUY GOOD FOR CANADA
  Amoco Corp's wholly owned Amoco
  Canada Petroleum Co Ltd said its proposed 5.22-billion-
  Canadian-dlr acquisition of Dome Petroleum Ltd will benefit
  Canada just like the foreign investment that made possible
  commercial development of Alberta's oilsands.
      Amoco Canada president T. Don Stacy told an oilsands
  conference that "Amoco Canada has presented the solution to the
  Dome problem, and we're investing our confidence, dollars and
  determination to make that solution work."
      The Amoco buyout of debt-burdened Dome has angered Canadian
  nationalists, who want a Canadian buyer for Dome.
      Stacy described Amoco Canada's previously reported share
  offer proposal as a chance to increase Canadian ownership of
  the country's oil and gas industry, now at about 50 pct.
      He reiterated that Amoco planned virtually no layoffs of
  Dome employees. He also reaffirmed that Amoco would reinvest in
  Amoco Canada-Dome properties all available cash flow for five
  years after the acquisition.
