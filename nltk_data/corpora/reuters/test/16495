ARISTECH &lt;ARS> SAYS 1ST QTR SHR ESTIMATE RIGHT
  Aristech Chemical Corp chairman and
  chief executive officer Thomas Marshall said analysts'
  estimates of its 1987 fiscal year earnings of 2.25 dlrs to 2.50
  dlrs per share are about right.
      Addressing a gathering of analysts and institutional
  investors, Marshall also said that analysts' estimates of its
  first qtr earnings - 50 cts to 55 cts per share - were "in the
  ballpark."
      Marshall said the full year estimates represent more than a
  32 pct increase over 1986's fiscal year net of 1.70 dlrs per
  share.
      He also said the first quarter estimates were 70 pct higher
  than 1986's first quarter net of 29 cts per share.
  Marshall attributibuted the first quarter earnings growth to
  several factors, including sustained demand in Aristech's major
  domestic markets and continued growth in exports.
      Aristech plans to spend approximately 200 mln dlrs over in
  capital investments over the next three years, Marshall added.
