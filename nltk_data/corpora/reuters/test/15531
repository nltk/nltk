LONDON FREIGHT MARKET FEATURES GRAIN OUT OF U.S.
  Moderately active grain fixing was
  reported out of the U.S. But none of the business involved the
  significant voyages to the Continent or Japan, ship brokers
  said.
      A steady 13.50 dlrs was paid from the U.S. Gulf to Morocco
  and 23.25 dlrs was paid for 27,000 long tons from the Gulf to
  Taiwan. A vessel carrying 13,500 long tons of bagged wheat
  flour from the Gulf to Aqaba received a lump sum of 472,500
  dlrs.
      Grain from the Great Lakes to Algeria made 28 dlrs against
  27.75 paid for similar fixing towards the end of March.
      Market talk suggested a Federal Commerce vessel had been
  booked to move grain from the Great Lakes to Morocco on Comanav
  account at about 22 dlrs and 15.50 had been paid for a cargo of
  oilseeds from British Columbia to Japan, but no confirmation
  was obtainable.
      On the Continent, shippers agreed 19 dlrs for wheat from La
  Pallice to Buenaventura and 10.75 dlrs for grain from Ghent to
  Naples/Venice range. Elsewhere, maize from East London to Japan
  paid 22 dlrs.
      Soviet charterers reappeared in the timecharter sector and
  secured a 30,000 tonner from Savona for a trans-Atlantic round
  trip at 4,450 dlrs daily and a 31,000 tonner from
  Antwerp-Hamburg for a similar voyage at 4,250 dlrs daily.
