USDA SEEKS COMMENTS ON GRAIN DISCOUNT SCHEDULE
  The U.S. Agriculture Department is
  seeking public comments on the question of adjusting the
  Commodity Credit Corporation's (CCC) discount and premium
  schedules to improve the quality of grain it accepts as loan
  collateral or under price support programs.
      The premiums and discounts schedule are based on quality
  factors such as moisture content and kernel damage. The
  schedule stipulates the premiums and discounts used for valuing
  grain the CCC accepts or purchases during the year.
      The department said it is possible that producers could be
  encouraged to delivery higher quality grain to CCC by adjusting
  the premiums and discounts.
      Comments are due by April 24 and a report to Congress is
  required by law by May 10.
