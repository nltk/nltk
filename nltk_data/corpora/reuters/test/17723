COMPUTERLAND TO BE ACQUIRED BY INVESTOR GROUP
  Computerland Corp said an
  investor group led by the financial services firm E.M. Warburg
  Pincus and Co Inc has agreed to acquire Computerland's
  business.
      Computerland, a privately-held company said to be the
  world's largest retailer of personal computers, declined to
  provide details of the arrangement.
      But the company said it expects to close the acquisition
  over the next 60 to 90 days.
      In announcing the transaction, Computerland said the
  acquisition will provide it with resources and support to
  maintain and expand its leadership position in the computer
  retail industry.
      Computerland also said its network retail sales in 1986
  totalled 1.45 billion dlrs.
