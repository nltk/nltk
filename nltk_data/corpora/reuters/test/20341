BETHLEHEM STEEL &lt;BS> SETS STEEL PRICE INCREASES
  Bethlehem Steel Corp said prices
  for steel sheet products will be increased up to 30 dlrs a ton
  effective January 3.
      The increases will affect certain non-contract or spot
  transactions and will be achieved through reductions in
  competitive discounts.
      The company said transaction prices for contract accounts,
  which have a duration of six months or more, will also be
  increased to commensurate levels.
      Percentage increases were not immediately available.
      Prices for flat-rolled steel sheet, used in automobiles,
  appliances and other products, vary widely between about 350
  and 800 dlrs a ton.
      The company said it was taking the actions to restore sheet
  transaction prices to more equitable levels. In many cases,
  prices are still lower than those attained in 1984, it said.
      Bethlehem also said that in response to changing market
  conditions and potential inflationary pressures, efforts will
  be made to mininize the number and the duration of firm price
  contracts.
