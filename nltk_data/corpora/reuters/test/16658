ABU DHABI MARKETING SAID NOT BREACHING OPEC PACT
  A senior Abu Dhabi oil official said
  in remarks published today the emirate, largest producer in the
  United Arab Emirates (UAE), was succeeding in marketing its
  crude oil without breaching OPEC accords.
      Khalaf al-Oteiba, Marketing Director at the Abu Dhabi
  National Oil Co (ADNOC), told the company's Petroleum Community
  magazine ADNOC was also keen to keep good customer relations.
  "The company will maintain its dialogue with and care for its
  customers in accordance with market conditions...And take
  necessary steps to guarantee marketing its production," he said.
     "The present oil marketing policy of ADNOC is based on
  adherence to OPEC decisions of December 1986 to control
  production and establish a new pricing system in an attempt to
  stabilize the market," he added.
      OPEC agreed last December to limit production to 15.8 mln
  bpd and return to fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel.
      Oteiba said stabilization of the oil market in the future
  depended on how much discipline OPEC showed.
      Oteiba said last year, when world oil prices dropped, was
  ADNOC's most difficult ever but "a practical and flexible
  pricing policy was implemented to relate to the changed market
  environment."
      He said crude oil sales last year jumped to an average
  609,000 bpd of which 73 pct was exported. Refined product sales
  totalled eight mln metric tonnes, of which 67 pct was exported.
      In 1985, ADNOC marketed a total of 476,000 bpd of crude oil
  and 7.2 mln tonnes of refined products.
