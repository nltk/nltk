CONSENSUS SEEN ON TIN PACT EXTENSION
  The quarterly session of the
  International Tin Council (ITC) continued without formal
  agreement on an extension of the sixth International Tin
  Agreement (ITA), but delegates said it was apparent there was a
  general consensus the Agreement should be prolonged.
      Some delegations are still awaiting formal instructions
  from capitals, but informally most have indicated they favour
  an extension, delegates said.
      This afternoon's session was used by delegates to seek
  further clarification on some of the issues involved, and to
  discuss internal matters.
      Some sources were optimistic a resolution on an extension
  could be passed tomorrow but others suggested a special session
  would be convened to adopt the resolution after the Association
  of Tin Producing Countries meeting April 14 to 16.
      The full Council session resumes tomorrow at 1330 GMT after
  a European Community coordination meeting at 1100.
