  Goodman Fielder Ltd &lt;GOOW.S> of Australia
  said in a statement that it had acquired 31 mln ordinary shares
  in Ranks Hovis McDougall Plc &lt;RHML.L> (RHM), bringing its stake
  in the company to 29.9 pct or 101 mln ordinary shares.
      Goodman said it has no intention of making a full bid for
  the company and would not contemplate doing so over the next

  which is unwelcome and not in the long term interest of
  shareholders.
