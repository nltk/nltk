GENETICS &lt;GENI.O> SEES HIGHER 87 LOSSES
  Genetics Institute Inc,
  earlier reporting an increased first quarter net loss, said it
  expects to incur losses in fiscal 1987 "that are somewhat higher
  than those reported in fiscal 1986."
      It had a loss of 4,504,000 dlrs for fiscal 1986 ended
  November 30, compared to a fiscal 1985 loss of 1,732,00 dlrs.
      The company said the losses result from its strategic
  decision to invest prudent levels of equity in development of
  products the company can manufacture and bring to market.
      Genetics earlier said first quarter ended February 28
  losses rose to 1,309,000 dlrs from year-ago loss of 937,000
  dlrs.
