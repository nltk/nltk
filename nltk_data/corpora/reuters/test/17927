BP CUTS NORTH SEA PROPANE PRICE, BUTANE UNCHANGED
  British Petroleum LP Gas International
  said it cut its North Sea LPG (Liquified Petroleum Gas) posted
  price for propane to 95 dlrs from 110 dlrs a tonne, effective
  June 1.
      The move follows a similar cut to 92 from 108 dlrs a tonne
  announced by Shell U.K. Ltd Friday, also fob North Sea
  terminals and effective June 1 until further notice. Both
  companies left their butane prices unchanged at 123 dlrs a
  tonne.
      A BP statement said its cut came "as a result of a price
  review occasioned by substantial changes in the LPG market." BP
  last lowered its posted propane price from 175 dlrs a tonne on
  March 1, and Shell U.K.'s last change was from 113 dlrs May 1.
