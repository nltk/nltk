U.S. AGENCY RULES AGAINST BRAZIL ORANGE JUICE
  The U.S. International Trade
  Commission, ITC, voted to authorize the Commerce Department to
  impose anti-dumping duties on imports of Brazilian frozen
  concentrated orange juice.
      The ITC voted 3-2 in favor of the anti-dumping petition in
  its final ruling on the matter.
      Today's ITC ruling was consistent with the Commerce
  Department's final ruling of March 9, and activates an
  anti-dumping duty of 1.96 pct on imports of Brazilian frozen
  concentrated orange juice, Stephen Vastagh, ITC investigator
  said.
      The ITC found that Brazilian orange juice imports have
  injured U.S. producers. The Commerce Department had already
  ruled that the imports were unfairly priced, and lowered to
  1.96 pct the anti-dumping margin that in a preliminary decision
  last fall had been set at 8.5 pct, Vastagh said.
      The U.S. government has been requiring bond to be posted on
  imports of Brazilian frozen concentrated orange juice since
  Commerce's preliminary ruling of last October 23, he said.
      Commerce had ruled that one major Brazilian producer --
  Cutrale -- would be excluded from the anti-dumping duty.
      Brazilian imports account for about 40 pct of total U.S.
  supply, Vastagh said. Between December 1985 and November 1986,
  the United States imported the equivalent of 546 mln gallons of
  Brazilian orange juice worth 622 mln dlrs, he said.
      Currently, the United States requires a 35-cent per gallon
  tariff on orange juice imports, Vastagh said.
      An ITC spokesman said the agency would forward its final
  report on the anti-dumping case to Commerce by April 22.
      Commerce then will process the anti-dumping order and
  transmit it to U.S Customs, which will liquidate bond entries
  dating from Commerce's preliminary ruling and begin assessing
  duties, Vastagh said.
      He said about 12 Brazilian orange juice exporters,
  including three major shippers, would be affected by the
  decision.
