TECSYN &lt;TSNA.TO> TERMINATES TAKEOVER TALKS
  TecSyn International Inc
  said it terminated takeover discussions with a U.S.-based
  investors group after the group was unable to establish access
  to funds to complete the proposed transactions, contrary to
  previous assurances.
      TecSyn previously said it and its controlling shareholders
  accepted in principle a proposal from the group to offer nine
  dlrs a share for 70 pct of TecSyn's outstanding shares.
      The investor group also planned to invest 22.5 mln dlrs in
  a private placement of four mln non-voting TecSyn common
  shares, the company said.
