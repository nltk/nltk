REAGAN URGES FULFILLMENT OF EXCHANGE ACCORDS
  President Reagan, preparing to depart
  for the Venice economic summit on Wednesday, said the United
  States and its allies must fulfill agreements on exchange rate
  stability.
      "Economic policy decisions made last year in Tokyo, and at
  this year's meetings of Group of 7 Finance ministers in Paris
  and in Washington, cannot be ignored or forgotten," he said.
      "The commitments made at these meetings need to be
  translated into action," Reagan said in a pre-summit speech
  celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Marshall Plan.
