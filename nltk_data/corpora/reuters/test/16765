60,000 TONNES CORN SMUGGLED INTO PHILIPPINES-PAPER
  At least 60,000 tonnes of corn worth 240
  mln pesos have been smuggled into the Philippines over the past
  few months, the Manila Bulletin newspaper said, quoting an
  official in the National Food Authority (NFA).
      The official, who was not named, said a large corn shortage
  and corruption among customs and Coast Guard personnel have
  jeopardised the government's ban on corn imports, which was
  aimed at saving foreign currency.
      The newspaper quoted NFA Marketing Director Jig Tan as
  saying monthly corn consumption stood at about 331,000 tonnes
  against a national stock inventory of 191,732 tonnes.
      Tan said a continuing drought affecting about 49,150
  hectares of corn has led to the loss of 43,725 tonnes of corn
  worth 174.9 mln pesos and contributed to the shortage.
      The newspaper quoted Linda Geraldez, an NFA statistician,
  as saying despite the drought and the shortage, the total
  inventory at the end of the January/June crop season is
  expected to be at least 201,000 tonnes.
