VIEILLE MONTAGNE SAYS 1986 CONDITIONS UNFAVOURABLE
  A sharp fall in the dollar price of
  zinc and the depreciation of the U.S. Currency created
  unfavourable economic conditions for Vieille Montagne SA
  &lt;VMNB.BR> in 1986.
      It said in a statement that the two factors led to a
  squeeze on refining margins and an 18.24 pct fall in sales and
  services income despite an unchanged level of activity.
      Vieille Montagne, which is actively pursuing a
  restructuring program, reported a 198 mln franc net loss, after
  187 mln francs in provisions for the closure of an electrolysis
  plant, compared with a 250 mln franc net profit in 1985.
