MEXICAN CATTLE IMPORTS TO BE BRANDED - USDA
  All steers imported into the United
  States from Mexico must now be branded with the letter M on the
  right jaw, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
      In its World Production and Trade Report, the department
  said the branding is necessary to improve surveillance for
  bovine tuberculosis because it provides a permanent way to
  identify Mexican steers.
      The requirement is not expected to affect the number of
  Mexican steers imported into the United States and the brand
  will be applied before the animals arrive at U.S. ports of
  entry.
      Last November, the Mexican Government authorized an export
  quota of nearly 1.1 mln head of live cattle for the 1986/87
  season (Aug-July), most of which goes to the United States.
