COLOMBO TO DEFEND WATERS, INDIA READIES FLOTILLA
  Sri Lanka today ordered its armed forces
  to defend the island's territorial waters as India prepared to
  send a flotilla with relief supplies that Colombo says it does
  not want for the Tamils in the Jaffna peninsula.
      The sudden crisis between Sri Lanka and its giant neighbour
  deepened as Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa told
  parliament: "We have our territorial limits and nobody can be
  allowed to trespass there ...
      "President (Junius) Jayewardene has ordered the army, navy
  and air force to protect the island and its territorial waters,"
  Premadasa said to a round of applause from the house.
      In New Delhi an Indian spokesman said the plan to send a
  flotilla of 20 small unarmed boats with Red Cross supplies to
  Jaffna tomorrow would go ahead despite Colombo's objections.
      The confrontation was the latest result of the long and
  bitter conflict between Sri Lanka's Buddhist Sinhalese majority
  and the Hindu Tamil minority, which has strong ethnic and
  cultural links with India's 50 mln Tamils.
