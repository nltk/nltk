WORLD BANK LOANS UGANDA 13 MLN DLRS
  The World Bank said it has loaned
  Uganda 13 mln dlrs through the International Development
  Association (IDA), the bank's concessionary lending affiliate.
      The IDA loan will support a project that hopes to preserve
  the country's natural forests and meet its demand for wood
  products by rehabilitating Uganda's forestry management agency,
  the bank said.
      It also said the project plans to increase the area and
  management of protected forests, establish pilot wood farms and
  nurseries, and rehabilitate soft wood plantations.
