DOE REACHES PROPOSED OIL SETTLEMENTS
  The Energy Department said it reached
  proposed oil pricing settlements totaling 680,150 dlrs with the
  operator and four working interest owners of A.D. LeBlanc No. 1
  well, Vermillion Parish, La.
      Trigon Exploration Co., Inc operated the well from June
  1979 to January 1981 for D. Bryan Ferguson, C. William Rogers,
  Omni Drilling Partnership No 1978-2 and Entex Inc.
      DOE alleged Trigon caused overcharges of 624,208 dlrs by
  improperly classifying its oil as "newly discovered crude," a
  classification that allowed charging higher prices during a
  period of price controls.
      It said the proposed settlements would resolve disputes
  over possible violations by the five parties. DOE added that in
  agreeing to the settlements, the five did not admit any
  violations or non-compliance with its regulations.
      It said it would receive written comments on the
  settlements before making it final.
