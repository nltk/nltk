NOVA &lt;NVAA.TO> CONSIDERING BID FOR DOME &lt;DMP>
  Nova Corp is considering a
  takeover bid for Dome Petroleum Ltd, either alone or as part of
  a consortium, Nova chairman Bob Blair said.
      "We are thinking about making an offer to Dome or Amoco
  (Canada Petroleum Co Ltd) or the creditors," Blair told
  reporters before the annual meeting. Amoco Canada is a unit of
  Amoco Corp &lt;AN>, which has made a 5.2 billion-dlr acquisition
  offer for Dome.
      "There is ongoing, serious thought applied to Dome in Nova
  and in Husky, but no decision of substance as to future action
  has been taken in either company," Blair said. Nova owns 43 pct
  of Husky Oil Ltd &lt;HYO.TO>.
      Blair also said that Nova has made no decision as to
  whether it would want to be lead partner in a joint purchase of
  Dome.
      He added that some of the discussions with other parties
  about Dome included TransCanada PipeLines Ltd &lt;TRP>, but
  refused to name the other participants.
