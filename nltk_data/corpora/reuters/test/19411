DAYTON HUDSON &lt;DH> NOT INTERESTED IN ACQUISITION
  Dayton Hudson Corp, in a
  letter to employees, said it told an "aggressive buyer" of the
  company's stock that it does not want to be acquired.
      A Dayton Hudson spokeswoman would not identify the buyer,
  but Wall Street sources said Dart Group Corp &lt;DARTA.O> was the
  company interested in buying Dayton Hudson stock.
      The Wall Street sources said the Dart Group is expected
  soon to file a statement with the Securities and Exchange
  Commission on its accumulation of Dayton Hudson stock.
      According to the letter to company employess, Dayton Hudson
  management has moved in two directions to fend off a takeover.
  According to the letter, chairman Kenneth Macke expressed to
  the group buying its stock the company's desire to remain
  independent.
      Dayton Hudson Thursday night met with Minnesota governor
  Rudy Perpich, appealing for legislative help.
      A spokesman for Governor Perpich earlier said the governor
  is expected later today to recommend stiffening the state's
  anti-takeover law to help the Minneopolis retailer defend
  itself.
      Minnesota House speaker designate said the legislators
  would probably look at language similar to that contained in
  Indiana and New York law. He said any amendment proposed would
  probably be designed to thwart a company from dismantling a
  company for its own profit.
     "Obviously Dayton-Hudson people feel whatever statutes we
  have would not protect them enough," Vanasek said.
