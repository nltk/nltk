  up from 53.4 mln dlrs at December 31 and 79 mln dlrs at March
  31, 1986 the bank said.
      The provision for loan losses for the first quarter was
  eight mln dlrs compared to 11 mln a year ago. Net loan charge
  offs were six mln dlrs, down from 11 mln dlrs a year ago.
      The reserve for loan losses was 78.1 mln dlrs, or two pct
