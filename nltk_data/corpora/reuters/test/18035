U.S. HOUSE PANEL VOTES TO SPEED UP CORN PAYMENTS
  The House Agriculture Committee voted
  to make approximately 2.8 billion dlrs of feedgrains deficiency
  payments immediately instead of in the late fall.
      A similar measure was decisively defeated on the Senate
  floor last week.
      The bill, which passed by a voice vote, would allow
  so-called Findley payments to be made immediately rather than
  late this year. Payments for 1987-90 feedgrains crops would not
  be changed.
      Because the bill would move 2.8 billion dlrs of spending
  into fiscal 1987 from fiscal 1988, the measure is expected to
  meet stiff resistance in the full House.
