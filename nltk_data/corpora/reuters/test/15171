WHITE HOUSE STANDING FIRM ON JAPANESE SANCTIONS
  Presidential spokesman Marlin
  Fitzwater said U.S. trade sanctions against Japan were likely
  take effect on April 17 in spite of a "full court press" by
  Japanese officials to avoid them.
      "All indications are they will take effect," he said.
      "I would say Japan is applying the full court press ... They
  certainly are putting both feet forward in terms of explaining
  their position," Fitzwater told reporters.
      He noted high level meetings on the trade dispute are
  underway here but said, "I don't think there's anything I can
  report and I don't believe there's been any official movement."
