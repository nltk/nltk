STOLTENBERG NOT SURPRISED BY DOLLAR REACTION
  West German Finance Minister Gerhard
  Stoltenberg said he was not surprised by the overnight decline
  of the dollar in foreign exchange markets.
      Speaking briefly with reporters before entering a meeting
  of the International Monetary Fund he said, "These minor
  movements don't really affect us."
      The dollar declined in the initial reaction to a statement
  by the Group of Seven industrial countries reaffirming their
  Paris agreement in February to maintain their currencies around
  current levels.
