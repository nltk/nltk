JAPAN SEES HIGHER MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH THIS QUARTER
  The Bank of Japan said it forecast
  Japan's broadly-defined M-2 money supply average plus
  certificates of deposit (CDs) will rise by about nine pct in
  the current April-June quarter against 8.5 pct a year earlier.
      Unadjusted M-2 plus CDs rose a preliminary 8.8 pct in
  January/March 1987 compared with a nine pct rise a year
  earlier, it said.
      The bank said the forecast rise is due to an increase in
  floating deposits due to recent low interest rates and a shift
  to private banks from the Bank of Japan of 400-1,000 billion
  yen by the recently privatised Japanese Railways.
