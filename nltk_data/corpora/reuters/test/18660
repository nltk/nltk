GILLETTE &lt;GS> GETS OFFER FROM REVLON &lt;REV>
  Gillette Co said Revlon Group made an
  unsolicited request, asking the Gillette board to allow Revlon
  to make a cash offer for all Gillette shares of at least 40.50
  dlrs per share.
      Gillette said consent for the bid is required under a
  standstill agreement between Revlon and Gillette before Revlon
  can make any move on Gillette's stock.
      In November 1986, Revlon made an unsolicited offer for
  Gillette shares, Gillette said.
      Subsequently, Revlon withdrew its offer, sold back to
  Gillette the shares it owned at that time and entered into the
  standstill agreement.
      The Gillette board of directors has a regularly scheduled
  meeting this afternoon, and Gillette said it anticipates making
  a statement after that meeting.
