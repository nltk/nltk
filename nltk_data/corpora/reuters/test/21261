CORBY DISTILLERIES &lt;CDL.TO> TO BUY HEUBLEIN UNIT
  Corby Distilleries Ltd said it has
  agreed to buy Toronto-based McGuinness Distillers Ltd from
  Heublein Inc for about 45 mln dlrs in a move which Corby
  expects to add significantly to domestic earnings.
       Heublin is a subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan PLC
  (GMHL.L).
       Corby said McGuinness will remain a seperate business unit
  with a seperate sales force.
       McGuinness markets liquers, brandy, and other liquors and
  has entered the fast-expanding wine cooler market, Corby said.
       Corby said it expects to benefit from McGuinness's
  succesfull introduction of schnapps and coolers and its
  strength in traditional market sectors.       
       Heublein said the sale does not include McGuinness's
  Calona Wines Ltd, a Canadian wine company.
       Heublein said it is will still be represented in Canada by
  Gilbey Canada Inc. reuter
