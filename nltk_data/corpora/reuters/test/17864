EDELMAN DETAILS BURLINGTON &lt;BUR> OPTIONS SALE
  A tender offer of Asher Edelman and
  Dominion Textile Ltd &lt;DTX.TO> for Burlington Idustries Inc is
  not affected by the investors' sale of options to buy
  Burlington stock, according to an associate of Edelman.
      Noting that "our tender offer is definitely in place" the
  aide said the investors are prohibited by Securities and
  Exchange Commission regulations from exercising options as long
  as a tender offer is open. The options are due to expire at the
  end of June.
      He said the May 28 sale of options to buy 258,800
  Burlington shares was thus a "non-event."
