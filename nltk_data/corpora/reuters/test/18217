B.F. GOODRICH &lt;GR>  CANADA STUDIES PLANT
  The Quebec government said it joined
  with B.F. Goodrich Canada Inc to study the feasability of
  building a vinyl chloride monomer plant in Montreal. The plant
  would supply manufacturers of PVC construction and other
  materials in Eastern Canada and the Northeastern U.S.,
  government officials said.
      Theys said the  plant would cost about 125 mln Canadian
  dlrs, with production beginning in 1991 if economic conditions
  are right. more
      The Quebec government has said it wants the project to
  proceed because it would provide future demand for Petromont
  Inc petrochemical products. Petromont is jointly owned by Union
  Carbide Canada Ltd &lt;UCC.TO> and the Quebec government's SGF
  industrial development group. Its Montreal plant would provide
  ethylene as a raw material for the project.
       Quebec said it also wants Interprovincial Pipe Line Ltd
  &lt;IPIPF.O> to adapt its pipeline from Sarnia, Ont., to Montreal
  to carry natural gas liquids, a decision that will be made by
  the federal National Energy Board. It said the pipeline could
  provide Petromont with feedstock at one-third the cost of
  moving it by rail.
