MEDIA GENERAL &lt;MEGA> FAMILY WONT SELL SHARES
  Media General Inc's chairman, D.
  Tennant Bryant, said his family would not sell its controlling
  share block, so it would be impossible for an investor group
  led by &lt;Giant Group Ltd> to gain control of the company.
      The investor group, which includes Barris Industries
  &lt;BRRS.O>, recently reported that it acquired a 9.8 pct stake of
  Media General's class A shares and might seek control.
      Bryant said the company's class A stock elects only 30 pct
  of the board, with the remaining 70 pct being elected by class
  B shares, two-thirds of which are controlled by the Bryant
  family trust, which has no intention of selling its shares.
