STOLTENBERG SAYS CRITICISM NOT "ONE-WAY STREET"
  Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said he
  was surprised by recent criticism of West German economic
  policies voiced by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker but
  added that the criticism was not purely one-sided.
      Stoltenberg told the West German Trade and Industry
  Association (DIHT) that before a meeting with Baker on Monday,
  "There had been surprising notes of criticism (from the United
  States)." He added. "Criticism is not a one-way street."
      He did not elaborate, but Bonn has often called on the U.S.
  To reduce its federal budget deficit.
      Over the weekend Baker had criticised West German economic
  policies, saying that rises in domestic interest rates here
  were not in the spirit of last February's Louvre pact to
  stabilise currencies.
      Stoltenberg told the DIHT that his meeting on Monday with
  Baker had resolved differences between the two countries.
      At a news conference earlier on Tuesday Stoltenberg had
  declined to comment specifically on Baker's criticisms, but he
  had said that after three hours of discussions on Monday, "one
  remark or another has been clarified."
