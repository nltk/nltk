NEED FOR BIGGER ALLIED FORCE IN GULF PLAYED DOWN
  Secretary of State George Shultz said
  today that a boost in allied forces in the Mideast Gulf was not
  vital to protect shipping against attack but that possible
  allied contributions should be examined.
      Asked if he saw the need for a greater military presence by
  the allies in the gulf, Shultz told reporters, "Not necessarily,
  particularly, so."
      But he said an adequate force was needed to deter attack
  and noted that the British and the French, as well as the
  United States, maintained naval contingents there.
      "We have to look at things that others might do," he said.
