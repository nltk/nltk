REAGAN SEEKS ROMANIA TRADE CONCESSION
  President Reagan called for continued
  nondiscriminatory treatment for Romanian exports to the United
  States in the face of congressional opposition because of the
  Bucharest government's record on human rights.
      A White House statement said Reagan's decision to press for
  continuation of so-called Most Favored Nation (MFN) status for
  Romania had been "exceptionally difficult" and came after "all
  options were seriously considered."
      But the statement said that despite concerns about human
  rights abuses by the Bucharest government, the president had
  decided that should be continued because it helped stimulate
  emigration from Romania and gave the United States influence on
  human rights practices there.
      The statement was issued as Reagan sent to Congress
  requests for one-year extensions of MFN for Romania, Hungary
  and China.
      The House of Representatives has attached to a trade bill
  legislation that would temporarily deny MFN for Romania pending
  certification by Reagan that the country had made progress on
  human rights. There is no controversy over continuation of MFN
  for Hungary and China.
