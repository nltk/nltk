TAIWAN TO REOPEN TENDER FOR U.S. SOYBEANS
  The joint committee of Taiwan's soybean
  importers will reopen a tender tomorrow for two shipments of
  54,000 to 66,000 tonnes of U.S. Soybeans, a committee spokesman
  told Reuters.
       The committee rejected a tender today for a cargo of
  27,000 to 33,000 tonnes on the grounds the prices offered by
  the U.S. Suppliers were too high, he said.
      The committee will be seeking a further shipment of between
  27,000 and 33,000 tonnes when it reopens the tender tomorrow,
  he added.
