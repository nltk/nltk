PAN-ALBERTA/UNITED GAS SETTLEMENT APPROVED
  Pan-Alberta Gas Ltd said its
  1986 proposed settlement with United Gas Pipe Line Co, of
  Houston, received unconditional approval by the U.S. Federal
  Energy Regulator Commission.
      Pan-Alberta said the approved deal authorized terms of a
  two-year interim contract amendment, cash payments and
  transportation credits for Pan-Alberta's customers, minimum
  yearly natural gas takes by United and a two-year commodity
  price. United will pay Pan-Alberta producers about 50 mln dlrs
  over the interim period and take at least an average 40 mln
  cubic feet a day of gas, Pan-Alberta said.
