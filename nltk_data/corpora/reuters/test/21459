U.S. NAVAL FORCES ATTACK IRANIAN OIL PLATFORM
  U.S. warships attacked and destroyed
  an Iranian oil platform on Monday in retaliation for Friday's
  Iranian attack damaging a U.S.-flagged ship, U.S. Defense
  Secretary Caspar Weinberger said.
      When asked how much was left of the oil platform,
  Weinberger said, "Nothing."
      "There was no Iranian reaction," he said. "... We consider
  this matter is now closed."
      Weinberger said four U.S. destroyers attacked the platform
  about 120 miles east of Bahrain in the central Gulf with fire
  at 0700 EDT, Weinberger said.
      "We chose a platform used by the Iranians to interfere with
  and be a source of potential attack on convoys...," Weinberger
  said at a Pentagon briefing. 
      "We know it has been used indeed, to not only launch small
  boat attacks on shipping but to fire on U.S. helicopters...
      "It's removal will contribute significantly to the safety of
  U.S. forces in the future," Weinberger said of the U.S. Navy's
  operation to escort oil tankers through the Gulf.
      "We do not seek further confrontation with Iran but we will
  be prepared to meet any escalation of military actions by Iran
  with stronger countermeasures," Weinberger said.
      He said the 20 to 30 Iranian personnel on the oil platform
  were given a 20-minute warning to abandon the platform.
      "As far as we know they did abandon the site," he said.
      Weinberger was asked why the United States had chosen to
  attack an oil platform rather than Iranian Silkworm missile
  platforms blamed by Washington for Friday's attack.
