FIRE AT TATE/LYLE LONDON JETTY HALTS UNLOADING
  No raw sugar is being unloaded at Tate
  and Lyles refinery at Silvertown on the River Thames following
  a fire yesterday afternoon, Tate and Lyle Plc said.
      The fire destroyed a large sector of the main conveyor from
  the raw sugar jetty to the weighhouse.
      The company said it is not yet known how long the jetty
  will be out of use but it hoped that by tomorrow unloading of
  the bulk carrier Mykon Wave will be able to continue using
  temporary arrangements, Tate and Lyle said.
      The Mykon Wave arrived in the port recently with about
  18,300 tonnes of bulk sugar from Maputo in Swaziland. About
  1,600 tonnes remain to be discharged.
      Five other ships loaded with raw sugar are awaiting at
  Silvertown to be discharged, Tate and Lyle added.
