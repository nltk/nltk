ZAMBIA CUTS PRICES AS TROOPS PATROL COPPERBELT
  The Zambian government today announced
  minor price cuts for essential commodities as part of its new
  economic strategy, while police and troops patrolled the
  northern Copperbelt to prevent any outbreaks of rioting.
      However, staple foods, such as bread, sugar and maize meal,
  were not affected by the cuts and many people said this could
  provoke trouble from disgruntled elements who had expected more
  sweeping reductions.
      Observers in the capital expressed disillusionment with the
  small extent of the price cuts, which ranged up to 10 pct on
  items such as blankets, soap, detergents and baby food.
      Residents in the Copperbelt contacted by telephone said
  government forces had set up roadblocks around the main towns.
      In Lusaka, business went on as usual and there was no sign
  of troops or police reinforcements on the streets.
      President Kaunda had ordered the price reductions to take
  account of lower import costs following the revaluation of the
  kwacha to a fixed rate of eight per dlr from 21 on May 1.
      The revaluation formed part of a new go-it-alone economic
  strategy which Kaunda adopted to replace Zambia's IMF austerity
  program.
      Labour leaders in the Copperbelt said last week gangs of
  unemployed youths were being formed in the politically volatile
  region to take action against shops that did not reduce their
  prices after today's deadline. Fifteen people were killed in
  the Copperbelt during food riots last December after the
  government tried to lift maize subsidies.
