NORTHGATE &lt;NGX> QUEBEC WORKERS END STRIKE
  Northgate Exploration Ltd said
  hourly-paid workers at its two Chibougamau, Quebec, mines voted
  on the weekend to accept a three-year contract offer and
  returned to work today after a one-month strike.
      It said the workers, represented by United Steelworkers of
  America, would receive a 1.21-dlr-an-hour pay raise over the
  life of the new contract and improved benefits.
      Northgate, which produced 23,400 ounces of gold in first
  quarter, said that while the strike slowed production, "We are
  still looking forward to a very satisfactory performance." The
  Chibougamau mines produced 81,500 ounces of gold last year.
