CREDIT COMMERCIAL DE FRANCE SPLITS SHARES
  French commercial bank Credit Commercial
  de France has split each of its shares into four to increase
  the number of shares on offer when it is privatised at the end
  of this month, a company official said.
      He told Reuters a general assembly had passed a proposal
  splitting 10.33 mln shares of 100 francs nominal into around
  41.32 mln shares of 25 francs nominal.
      Market sources have put the total value of CCF's selloff at
  between four and five billion francs. The bank said the share
  sale price was likely to be announced on April 24, before the
  launch of a public flotation offer on April 27.
