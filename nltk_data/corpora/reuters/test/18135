NCNB &lt;NCB> TO MERGE WITH (CENTRABANK)
  NCNB Corp said the board of
  governors of the Federal Reserve System approved its
  application to merge with (CentraBank Inc) of Baltimore,
  expected to be completed July 1.
      The company said the board's approval included the
  dismissal of a protest by the Baltimore-based Maryland Alliance
  for Responsible Investing against NCNB's performance under the
  Community Reinvestment Act.
     
      The company said Maryland Alliance wanted the merger
  blocked on the grounds that NCNB inadequately served the credit
  and financial needs of low-income and minority communities in
  its markets.
      The company said it denied the claim.
