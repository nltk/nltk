GERMAN EXPERTS SAY NO FURTHER ECONOMIC STIMULUS
  The West German government's independent
  council of economic experts believes a further stimulation of
  the economy is inappropriate, government spokesman Friedhelm
  Ost said.
      A statement released by Ost after a meeting of Chancellor
  Helmut Kohl and senior government officials with the council
  said the experts believed 1987 ecomomic growth of 1-1/2 to two
  pct was achievable.
      It added the council believed "an intensification of the
  already expansionary stimulation of monetary and financial
  policy is not called for."
      Ost's statement said experts believed further pressure on
  West Germany to adapt to external economic factors would not
  increase.
      The government regularly uses the term "changed external
  economic factors" when referring to the fall of the dollar,
  which has severely damaged West German exports. Bonn officials
  have said they expect exports to pick up during the year, but
  could still fall below the 1986 level.
      Along with other leading industrial countries, West Germany
  agreed to a package of measures at a meeting in Paris in
  February aimed at stemming the fall of the dollar.
      The stance taken by the experts backs up the official
  position of the West German government ahead of next week's
  seven nation summit in Venice, where Bonn is expected to be
  pressed by the U.S. And other partners to boost its economy.
      West German government officials have stressed Bonn is not
  in a position to stimulate growth further since tax cuts due
  next year and 1990 are already stretching the budget.
      The Bundesbank has also ruled out a quick cut in official
  interest rates although it sees market rates continuing low.
      The experts' prediction for economic growth this year of
  between 1-1/2 and two pct is a slight downward revision from a
  forecast made last November when two pct growth was forecast.
      Many independent forecasters have revised down 1987
  predictions in light of the downturn in exports. The government
  itself has said it expects growth of just under two pct,
  compared with a 2.4 pct expansion in 1986.
