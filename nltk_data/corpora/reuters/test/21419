  Telex Corp said its board has directed
  management and financial advisor Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc to
  investigate possible alternatives to the tender offer of Asher
  Edelman's TLX Partners for all Telex shares that may include
  seeking other purchasers for Telex.
      The company said the board at an October 16 meeting decided
  to defer until a board meeting later this week a recommendation
  on the Edelman offer and said the board expects to make a
  recommendation by October 23.
