CAROLCO &lt;CRC> MAY BID FOR LIEBERMAN &lt;LMAN.O>
  Lieberman Enterprises Inc said
  Carolco Pictures Inc is negotiating for the acquisition of the
  50 pct of Lieberman shares held by the families of chairman
  David Lieberman and president Harold Okinow at 20.50 dlrs each,
  and if the deal were concluded, public shareholders would be
  offered the same price for their shares.
      Lieberman said the Carolco bid to its public shareholders
  would be in cash or shareholders could be offered securities as
  an alternative. The offer would occur within about 90 days
  after the closing of the sale of the initial 50 pct stake, the
  company said.
      The company said a final agreement has not yet been reached
  on the first transaction, but negotiations are expected to be
  concluded in early June. Present management is expected to
  continue to operate Lieberman, the company said. Lieberman
  distributes prerecorded music, video movies and other products.
