HENLEY &lt;HENG.O> ENDS TALKS WITH SANTE FE
  Henley Group Inc said it ended
  talks with Sante Fe Southern Pacific Corp concerning the
  possible acquisition of Sante Fe's Southern Pacific
  Transportation Co subsidiary.
      The company also said it is reviewing its investment in
  Santa Fe Southern Pacific in light of Sante Fe's announcement
  that it recieved several bids ranging from 750 mln dlrs to more
  than one billion dlrs for its Southern Pafific Transportation
  subsidiary.
     
      Henley said it held discussions with Sante Fe concerning
  the acquisition by Henley of Bankers Leasing and Financial Corp
  and certain Sante Fe transportation and real estate assets.
      Henley said it began talks with Sante Fe after it announced
  its restructuring program in August 1987.
      As previously disclosed, Henley made necessary filings
  under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Acts to
  permit Henley to increase its investment in Sante Fe to 24.9
  pct of the outstanding common stock from 5.03 pct.
     
      Henley said that depending on prevailing conditions,
  including price and availability of Sante Fe stock, substantial
  developments affecting Sante Fe, other investment and business
  opportunities available to Henley, Henley may additional Sante
  Fe shares, or sell all or part of its investment in Sante Fe.
