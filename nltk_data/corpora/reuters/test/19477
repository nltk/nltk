NO COMINCO STRIKE TALKS SCHEDULED
  Cominco Ltd said no
  talks were scheduled with striking workers at its Trail smelter
  and Kimberley, British Columbia lead-zinc mine.
      A company spokesman said the company and union met
  informally Tuesday but talks did not constitute a formal
  bargaining session. The last formal talks were on June 5.
      The workers went on strike May 9 and production has been
  shut down since then.
      The Trail smelter produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and
  110,000 long tons of lead last year. The Sullivan mine at
  Kimberley produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore in 1986, most for
  processing at the Trail smelter.
