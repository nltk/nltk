KUWAITI OIL EXPORTS SAID NOT AFFECTED BY GULF WAR
  Kuwait's oil exports have not been
  affected by the seven-year Iran-Iraq war, Kuwait Oil Tanker
  Company (KOTC) Chairman and Managing Director Abdul Fattah
  al-Bader told a Kuwaiti newspaper.
      "Kuwait has exploited all available opportunities to
  continue exporting its oil without any reduction," the Al-Anbaa
  newspaper quoted him as saying.
      He said KOTC made profits of more than two mln dinars
  (seven mln dlrs) in the fiscal year ending last June, but
  predicted lower profits this year due to higher costs for
  chartering and operating vessels.
