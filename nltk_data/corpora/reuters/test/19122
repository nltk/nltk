SPAIN CARGO FIRMS HIRE DOCKERS TO OFFSET STRIKE
  Cargo handling companies said they
  were hiring twice the usual number of dockers to offset an
  intermittent strike in Spanish ports.
      Spanish dockers began a nine-day strike on Wednesday in
  which they only work alternate hours in protest at government
  plans to partially privatize port services.
