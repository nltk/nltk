YUGOSLAVIA TO TENDER FOR 100,000 TONNES WHEAT
  Yugoslavia will tender April 14 for
  100,000 tonnes of wheat, the U.S. Agriculture Department's
  Counselor in Belgrade said in a field report.
      The report, dated April 7, said the wheat must be from 1986
  and 1987 harvest, and imports of soft wheat from Europe and
  from other suppliers will not be considered.
      It said the imports will be used to rebuild the federal
  reserves and as a result will not be subject to import
  surcharges.
