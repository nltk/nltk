BORDEN &lt;BN> TO ACQUIRE MAJOR PASTA MAKER
  Borden Inc said it is acquiring &lt;Prince
  Co Inc> and three companies producing grocery products for 180
  mln dlrs.
      Borden said the four companies are expected to have 1987
  sales totaling 230 mln dlrs.
      It said Prince, a Lowell, Mass., producer of pasta and
  Italian food sauces, is expected to account for 210 mln dlrs of
  this total. This year's sales of Borden pasta -- by the 13
  regional brands and the premium Creamette brand distributed on
  a nearly national basis -- are expected to toal 285 mln dlrs,
  it said.
      Borden said the other three companies being acquired are
  Steero Bouillon of Jersey City, N.J., Blue Channel Inc, a
  Beaufort, S.C., producer of canned crabmeat, and the canned
  shrimp products line of DeJean Packing Inc of Biloxi, Miss.
      Borden also said the divestment of three operations with
  about 50 mln dlrs a year in sales is expected to produce nearly
  45 mln dlrs in cash for use toward the purchase of new
  businesses.
      It said the sale of Polyco of Cincinnati, Ohio, which makes
  polyvinyl acetate emulsions, to Rohm and Haas Co &lt;ROH> was
  announced by the buyer last month.
     
      Borden said the divestment of two producers of toy models
  and hobby items -- Heller in France and Humbrol in England --
  is in process.
