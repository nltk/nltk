PRESTON CORP &lt;PTRK> SEES FIRST QUARTER LOSS
  Preston corp said it expects to
  report a loss of about 300,000 dlrs or five cts per share for
  the first quarter, compared with a profit of 1,081,000 dlrs or
  19 cts per share a year before.          
      The trucking company attributed the loss to the continued
  rate of discounted in its primary markets, flat revenues and
  increased costs, including uninsured claims expense resulting
  from adverse weather conditions during the last three months.
      It said results outside the Northeast were strong, and it
  expects to show improved results for the rest of the year.
