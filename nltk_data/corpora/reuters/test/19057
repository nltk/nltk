TAIWAN BUYS 32,000 TONNES OF U.S. SOYBEANS
  The joint committee of Taiwan's soybean
  importers awarded a contract to Cargill Inc of Minneapolis,
  Minnesota, for supply of one 32,000 tonne cargo of U.S.
  Soybeans, a committee spokesman told Reuters.
      The cargo, priced at 249.10 U.S. Dlrs per tonne c and f
  Taiwan, is set for delivery before July 7, he said.
      The committee cancelled a tender for another cargo because
  the prices offered by U.S. Suppliers were too high, he added.
