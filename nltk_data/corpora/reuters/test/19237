FED SETS SIX-DAY SYSTEM REPURCHASES
  The Federal Reserve entered the
  government securities market to arrange six-day repurchase
  agreements for system account, a spokeswoman for the New York
  Fed said.
      Fed funds were trading at 6-3/4 pct at the time of the
  direct injection of temporary reserves, dealers said.
      Economists had expected three- or six-day repurchases
  because the Fed needs to add a large volume of reserves this
  statement period.
