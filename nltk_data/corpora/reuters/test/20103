IRANIAN PREMIER REITERATES WARNING OF RETALIATION
  Iranian Premier Mir-Hossein Mousavi
  reiterated his country would retaliate for U.S. Navy attacks on
  Gulf oil platforms.
      "The U.S. Attack on Iran's oil platforms jeopardises our
  national sovereignty ... And we will retaliate properly for
  this perfidious American aggression," Mousavi told a news
  conference in Damascus.  On Monday U.S. Navy warships blasted
  the Rostam platform, and Navy personnel stormed a second
  platform a few miles away. Washington said the operation was
  aimed at destroying positions used by Iran to track and assault
  neutral Gulf shipping.
