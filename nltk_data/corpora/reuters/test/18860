IBC DETAILS PLANS TO PAY CREDITORS
  The Brazilian Coffee Institute,
  IBC, gave details of its plans to pay the 18 companies that
  bought 630,000 bags of robusta coffee in the London market on
  its behalf last September.
      An IBC spokesman told Reuters that a 15 mln dlr loan from
  the Banco do Brasil would be used to pay five mln dlrs a month
  in June, July and August to creditors.
      He said an auction of coffee would raise additional money
  and added that a Reuter report on June 16 gave the wrong
  impression that the auction was necessary to raise part of the
  15 mln dlrs. No date has yet been set for the auction.
