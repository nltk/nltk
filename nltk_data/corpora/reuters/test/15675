WEATHER HURTS ITALIAN ORANGES - USDA REPORT
  Unfavorable weather conditions during
  the second week of March caused damage to oranges in the
  Calabria region in southern Italy, the U.S. Agriculture
  Department's officer in Rome said in a field report.
      The report, dated April 3, said the region accounts for
  about 22,000 hectares of the Italian orange crop or about 26
  pct of total production.
      However, orange production in the region for marketing year
  1986/87 is forecast at 565,000 tonnes or 25 pct of the total
  Italian orange crop, it said.
      The report said trade contacts agree that about 15 pct of
  the orange output in Calabria was damaged by frost.
