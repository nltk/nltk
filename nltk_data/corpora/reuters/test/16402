ITALY'S BUITONI ACQUIRES VISMARA FOOD GROUP
  Carlo De Benedetti's food
  company Industrie Buitoni Perugina Spa said it has acquired the
  Italian food group Vismara.
      Buitoni said in a statement that Vismara had 1986 sales of
  181 billion lire and net profit of 11 billion lire, employs 950
  people and has four subsidaries.
      Buitoni did not disclose financial details about the
  acquisition. De Benedetti said last week that his group was
  negotiating a purchase of an unidentified Italian food firm.
      Vismara primarily produces a variety of pork products. "The
  acquisition represents a diversification in a market sector
  with annual consumption of 8,500 billion lire," Buitoni said.
      Buitoni also said its consolidated revenue during the first
  quarter of this year was 429 billion lire, up 51 pct from the
  comparable 1986 period.
      As reported, Buitoni's consolidated revenue rose last year
  to 1,623 billion lire from 1,177 billion in 1985. Net profit
  rose to 18.5 billion lire from 448 mln lire in 1985.
