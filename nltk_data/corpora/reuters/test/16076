AUSTRALIAN UNIONS AND NSW GOVERNMENT REACH DEAL
  Union and New South Wales government
  officials have reached a compromise in a dispute over workers
  compensation, averting increased industrial action in the
  state, union sources said.
      But some unions, including those of building and mining
  workers, said they were dissatisfied with the deal and would
  continue their strikes for a few more days.
      State officials said the government had agreed to revise
  its proposals to cut compensation and would allow slightly
  higher cash benefits for injured workers.
      Under the original proposal, which sparked strikes and
  other industrial action in the state on April 7, workers'
  compensation would have been cut by one third. Full details of
  the compromise package are not yet known.
      The Labour Council, affiliated to the Australian Council of
  Trade Unions (ACTU), had threatened to paralyse New South Wales
  unless the government modified its pending legislation on the
  issue.
      State officials said the only sectors affected in the past
  three days were some government building projects, railway
  freight movement and cargo handling in Sydney's ports.
