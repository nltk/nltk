JAPAN READY TO USE DIPLOMACY FOR GULF SECURITY
  Japan was ready to use diplomacy to help
  maintain the security of the Gulf, Prime Minister Yasuhiro
  Nakasone said.
      But he told reporters Japan should not cut its lines of
  communication with Iran and Iraq because its policy was to take
  a broad political stance. Officials of the foreign ministry
  said Japan had maintained good relations with both Iran and
  Iraq, which have been at war since September 1980.
      Last week Nakasone ruled out Japanese military or financial
  help to patrol the waters of the Gulf. About 60 pct of Japan's
  crude oil passes through the waterway.
      President Reagan said yesterday the threat to oil routes in
  the Gulf from attacks by Iran and Iraq was high on the agenda
  for next week's G-7 summit in Venice.
      Reagan has approved plans for the United States to step up
  its naval presence in the Gulf despite congressional
  expressions of concern and he has called on U.S. Allies to help
  maintain freedom of navigation.
      Japan's constitution prevents its armed forces from being
  deployed overseas. Nakasone has said that Washington
  understands this problem.
