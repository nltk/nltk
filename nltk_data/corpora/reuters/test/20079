INRO COUNCIL MEETING ADJOURNED UNTIL THURSDAY
  A Council meeting of the
  International Natural Rubber Organization (INRO) has been
  adjourned until Thursday as tomorrow is a Malaysian national
  holiday, officials of the organisation said.
      The main issue at the talks, which opened here yesterday,
  has been the INRO buffer stock and the manner in which the
  buffer stock manager should continue to sell rubber after the
  current international pact for the commodity expires on October
  22, they said.
      The deadline for the start of the new pact is January 1989.
      Buffer stock manager Aldo Hofmeister has been mandated to
  continue selling rubber during the interim period.
      Other issues discussed include ratification of the new
  accord, the officials said.
      Only Malaysia of the pact's 32 producing and consuming
  member countries had ratified the new agreement by the
  beginning of this month.
      The meeting is due to end on Thursday.
