TRACE PRODUCTS &lt;TRCE.O> MERGER AGREEMENT SUSPENDED
  Trace Products Inc said its stock-swap
  merger agreement with privately held Central Point Software has
  been suspended indefinitely because of uncertainty in the stock
  market.
      Trace Products, which manufactures diskette and tape
  duplication equipment for software publishers, had earlier
  agreed to acquire Portland, Ore.-based Central Point for 5.5
  mln shares of its common stock.
