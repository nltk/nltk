TIN COUNCIL ALLOWED APPEAL ON USE OF DOCUMENTS
  Britain's highest court has decided the
  International Tin Council (ITC) can appeal over the use of ITC
  documents in court actions.
      On November 2 the House of Lords will decide if and to what
  extent ITC documents, whether circulated or not, are admissible
  as court evidence. Lawyers working in the legal tangle left
  from the October 1985 collapse of the tin market said this
  hearing is likely to last a few days.
      On Wednesday the Court of Appeal will link the outstanding
  ITC cases that have so far reached it and a single set of
  hearings could begin in early January, they added.
      The House of Lords ruling on the use of ITC documents will
  be referred back to the action by two Shearson Lehman companies
  against the London Metal Exchange although the underlying case
  is not expected to be resumed until mid-1988.
      The Court of Appeal hearings include action between brokers
  and cases by brokers and banks against the ITC and the member
  governments of the tin council.
      Action taken by brokers seeking both the winding up of the
  ITC or and placing it into receivership will also be covered by
  the Court of Appeal legal schedule.
