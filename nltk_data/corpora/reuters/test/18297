U.S. WHEAT IN SENEGAL MARKET -- USDA
  After a highly favorable reception of
  a trial batch of bread baked from 300 lbs of U.S. wheat flour
  last February, the Senegalese appear ready to take delivery of
  a first tranche of 10,500 tonnes of mixed U.S. wheat, the U.S.
  Agriculture Department said.
      In its report on U.S. Export Markets for U.S. Grain, the
  department noted Senegal had bought 100,000 tonnes of wheat
  under the Export Enhancement Program last November, but local
  opposition from millers, accustomed to French wheat, has been
  delaying deliveries.
      As a result there were a series of baking seminars as well
  as the trial batch, in an effort to satisfy local flour millers
  and convince key officials of the qualities of U.S. wheat.
      The department said if deliveries of U.S. wheat to Senegal
  remain on track, the U.S. could dominate a wheat market that
  had been expected to import 140,000 tonnes of mostly French
  wheat during the 1987/88 (July-June) season.
