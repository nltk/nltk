  Brooklyn Union Gas Co said it has
  contracted to purchase up to 60 mln cubic feet of natural gas
  per day from Shell Oil Co, a Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD> &lt;SC>
  subsidiary.
      Brooklyn Union said the long-term contract will cover about
  15 pct of its total supplies.
      A spokesman said Shell and the utility agreed to not
  disclose the length of the contract or the price of the gas,
  which he described as competitive with a market sensitive
  escalation formula.

  about 25 pct of the gas previously supplied by Transco Energy
  Inc's &lt;E> Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp subsidiary.

  being purchased from Shell Oil, possibly beginning as soon as
  November 1.
