IRAN SAYS U.S. NAVAL FORCES ATTACKED TWO PLATFORMS
  Iran said U.S. Naval forces attacked two
  of its oil platforms in the southern Gulf on Monday afternoon,
  the Iranian news agency IRNA reported.
      IRNA, received in Nicosia, said an informed source at the
  Iranian oil ministry identified the two platforms as Resalat
  and Reshadat, about 60 miles from Iran's Lavan island oil
  storage site.
      Regional shipping sources earlier said three Iranian
  offshore oil sites at Sassan, Rostam and Rakhsh had been
  attacked at 7.00 A.M. (0300 GMT) on Monday by unidentified
  aircraft.
      In Washington, U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger
  said four U.S. Destroyers attacked and destroyed an Iranian oil
  platform about 120 miles east of Bahrain.
