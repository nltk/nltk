MOBIL AUSTRALIA REPORTS 38.6 MLN DLR 1986 LOSS
  Wholly-owned Mobil Corp &lt;MOB> unit,
  &lt;Mobil Oil Australia Ltd>, reported a 38.63 mln dlr net loss in
  1986, a turnaround from its 37.25 mln profit in 1985.
      The loss reflected a combination of strikes plus scheduled
  and unscheduled refinery shutdowns for maintenance and
  inventory losses caused by government controls on both crude
  and product prices, Mobil said in a statement.
      However, equity-accounting of associates' profits reduced
  the loss to 24 mln dlrs against a 37 mln profit in 1985.
      Mobil said it was confident 1987 would see a return to
  profit as it built further on its 1985 company restructuring.
