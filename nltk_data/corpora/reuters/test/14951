JAPAN'S LDP URGES MORE IMPORTS OF 12 FARM ITEMS
  The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)
  has proposed expanding imports of 12 farm products named in a
  U.S. Complaint against Japan to the General Agreement on
  Tariffs and Trade last year, an LDP official said.
      The products include fruit juices, purees and pulp, some
  tomato products, peanuts, prepared beef products and beans.
      The proposal will be used as the basis for a more detailed
  LDP economic package to cut the trade surplus with the U.S. The
  party is expected to formalise the package before April 19,
  when LDP General Council Chairman Shintaro Abe visits
  Washington.
