U.S. REFUSES PARTS OF TWO AUSTRALIA BEEF CARGOES
  U.S. Agriculture Department
  inspectors have refused entry to parts of two lots of
  Australian beef because of pesticide residues, a spokeswoman
  for the department said.
      She said USDA has notified Australia, which assured it that
  stricter controls would be implemented.
      The Australian government had already imposed residue
  controls and it is believed the meat with the presticide
  residues was already in the pipeline before the controls were
  put in place, the spokeswoman said.
      There have been five other cases of Australian meat which
  had residue levels above U.S. allowable limits this year, she
  said.
