USDA SETS 0/92 PROVISION FOR SOME PRODUCERS
  Some producers in the 1987 acreage
  reduction program may be eligible for deficiency payments on 92
  pct of their enrolled acreage even though none of it is planted
  with wheat or other program crops, the U.S. Agriculture
  Department said.
      The department said the provision of the Farm Disaster
  Assistance Act will be available to all eligible winter wheat
  producers, producers of other types of wheat who were prevented
  from planting their 1987 wheat crop because of a 1986 natural
  disaster, and all producers who operate farms with program crop
  acreage bases subject to flooding on 50 pct of such crop's
  permitted acreage.
      A producer who did not enroll in the 1987 acreage reduction
  program may become eligible by signing-up no later than July
  15. Producers will be informed by the local offices when
  applications are being accepted, it said.
      The department said producers of wheat other than winter
  wheat may use the 0/92 option if they were preventedf from
  planting their intended acreage with wheat for harvest in 1987
  because of any natural disasters which occured in 1986 or if
  the farm is located in a county approved by Farmers Home
  Administration for emergency loans for such disasters that
  occurred in 1986.
