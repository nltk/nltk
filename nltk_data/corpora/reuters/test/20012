SUMITA WELCOMES U.S.-JAPAN AGREEMENT ON LOUVRE
  Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said
  he welcomed Monday's U.S. And West German joint confirmation of
  their commitment to the Louvre accord.
      Sumita said in a statement that world stockmarkets were
  excessively concerned about the economic future.
      The Bank of Japan will continue to adhere to a system of
  policy coordination based upon the Louvre accord of February,
  he said. The accord called for stability in foreign exchange
  rates. Exchange rates generally are regaining stability and the
  economies of industrialised nations are heading for a steady
  recovery, he said.
