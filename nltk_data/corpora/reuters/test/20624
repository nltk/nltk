US SENATE CUTS OFF STALL TACTICS ON GULF BILL
  Confronted by new hostilities
  involving U.S. forces in the Gulf, the U.S. Senate voted to end
  Republican stalling tactics and limit debate on a measure that
  could give Congress a larger role in Gulf policy.
      The measure, however, does not require President Reagan to
  comply with the 1973 War Powers Act as does a related Senate
  bill. The controversial War Powers Act could require a pullout
  of U.S. forces from the Gulf.
      The Senate voted 67-28 to stop a filibuster and limit
  debate to 30 hours on a bipartisan measure that requires Reagan
  to report to Congress on Gulf policy within 60 days and calls
  for a resolution to be passed in the House and Senate on the
  situation in the volatile waterway 30 days later.
      The resolution could be about any Gulf-related issue,
  including an expression of support or of disapproval for
  Reagan's policy of protecting 11 Kuwaiti tankers from Iran in
  the waterway. The Pentagon said the 12th U.S.-protected convoy
  began moving through the Gulf early Tuesday.
