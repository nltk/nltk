ARTILLERY SHELLS SAID TO FALL ON KUWAIT BORDER
  Artillery shells from an exchange of fire
  between Iran and Iraq fell on Kuwait's northern border on
  Tuesday but caused no casualties, the Kuwait News Agency KUNA
  said, quoting a Defense Ministry official.
      There were rumors in world oil markets on Tuesday that Iran
  had fired shells at an oil camp in northern Kuwait in
  retaliation for U.S. Attacks on Iranian oil platforms in the
  Gulf on Monday. "Several shells fell in a random manner on the
  northern border of the country," the official told KUNA. "It
  seems these shells arose from an exchange of fire between Iran
  and Iraq... No one was wounded and there were no losses."
      Diplomats said shells from the nearby Iran-Iraq warfront
  had in the past fallen in the northern Kuwaiti desert.
      A senior Kuwait Petroleum Corporation official had earlier
  told Reuters he was unaware of any attack against Kuwaiti oil
  installations.
