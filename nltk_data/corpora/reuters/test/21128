FED'S JOHNSON SAYS LOUVRE ACCORD STILL VITAL
  Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman
  Manuel Johnson said the Louvre Accord is still healthy, but
  said the United States and West Germany must work out
  differences over their respective roles in fulfilling the
  accord.
      "The Louvre Accord has worked very well in terms of
  stabilizing exchange rates," he said in response to a question
  during an American Stock Exchange conference here.
      He said exchange rates have been stable so far in 1987 as a
  result of the accord.
