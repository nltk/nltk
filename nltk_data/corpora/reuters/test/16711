CONVERGENT TECHNOLOGIES &lt;CVGT.O> SEES QTR LOSS
  Convergent Technologies Inc
  said it expects to report in the first quarter a loss more than
  twice the size of the 4.8-mln-dlr loss reported in the fourth
  quarter of 1986.
      Convergent reported a first quarter 1986 profit of
  2,100,000 dlrs, or five cts per share.
      The company said results declined in the quarter both in
  its traditional OEM business and its business systems group.
      The anticipated loss reflects lower than expected operating
  margins, start-up costs for new product manufacturing and
  higher than planned expenses.
