SRI LANKAN TEA WORKERS LAUNCH ONE-DAY PROTEST
  Thousands of tea workers of Indian origin
  went on strike today to press demands for citizenship and
  voting rights in Sri Lanka, a union statement said.
      The Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC) said its 400,000 members
  launched a prayer campaign at temples and other places in a
  non-violent protest to get the authorities to expedite
  citizenship procedures.
      A CWC spokesman said a three-day campaign was suspended
  after a Cabinet committee promised to speed up procedures under
  a new set of regulations. Trade sources said the strike did not
  affect production or today's Colombo auction.
