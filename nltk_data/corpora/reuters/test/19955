CONTEL &lt;CTC> UNIT SALES SEEN BY ANALYSTS
  Contel Corp's telecommunications
  equipment unit is the most likely candidate for sale by the
  Atlanta-based telecommunications company, Wall Street analysts
  said.
      "Executone is at the top of the list," said one analyst,
  referring to Contel's loss-riden telecommunications equipment
  unit. "The question is, who would take it?" he added.
      The company, forecasting a 15 pct drop in 1987 operating
  earnings over last year, said late today that it is reviewing
  all operations in an effort aimed at "maximizing long-term
  stockholder value."
      Analysts also said Contel's federal systems division, which
  has been hit with several executive defections, may also be put
  on the block.
      Contel officials declined to comment on the possibility of
  selling any operations. However, the company indicated in a
  statement that it was closely evaluating the telecommunications
  and federal systems units.
