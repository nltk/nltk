U.S.CONGRESSMAN TO SEE REAGAN ON GULF REFLAGGING
  U.S. House Speaker Jim Wright said he
  would question President Reagan tomorrow about his plan to
  protect Kuwaiti oil tankers with U.S. warships from attacks by
  Iran in the Gulf.
      House and Senate Democrats, who control Congress, have been
  critical of Reagan's plan but have not decided how or if they
  should try to pass legislation to prohibit it.
      Wright, a Texas Democrat, told reporters the Administration
  had gone ahead with plans to reflag the Kuwaiti tankers as U.S.
  ships without asking Congressional leaders for their advice.
