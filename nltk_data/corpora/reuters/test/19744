MAXTOR CORP &lt;MXTR.O> BUYS PRIVATE FIRM
  Maxtor Corp said it bought
  privately-held Storage Dimensions Inc for an undisclosed sum.
      The company said Storage Dimensions incorporates Maxtor's
  high-capacity 5-1/4-inch Winchester and optical disk drives
  into a family of data storage subsystems for IBM PCs, XTs, ATs
  and compatibles.
      Storage Dimensions is the creator or SpeedStor software, a
  utility program that integrates high-capacity disk drives into
  PCs.
      Maxtor said the purchase reflects its desire to compete in
  the high-capacity segment of the PC market.
