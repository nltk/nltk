MALAYSIA'S 1986 MANUFACTURING EXPORTS RISE 24 PCT
  Malaysia's manufacturing exports
  rose by 24.5 pct to 15.1 billion ringgit in 1986, chairman of
  the Export Promotion Council Ahmad Sarji Abdul Hamind said.
      The improved export performance was led by electrical and
  electronic products, textiles, footwear, clothing, processed
  food, timber, chemical and rubber products, he told a news
  conference.
      However, total gross exports for the year declined by 5.6
  pct to 35.9 billion ringgit from 38 billion in 1985 due to a
  fall in major commodity exports and weak prices, he said.
