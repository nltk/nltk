J.P. MORGAN&lt;JPM> SAYS DLR MAY PREVENT FED EASING
  The relatively high level of real U.S.
  interest rates suggests that there is scope for further
  declines in money market rates, but the Federal Reserve is
  unlikely to promote such a drop as long as the dollar remains
  volatile, said J.P. Morgan and Co Inc chairman Lewis Preston.
      He said in response to a reporter's question after the
  bank's annual meeting that money market rates could decline
  further but, "I don't think the Fed is going to encourage that
  as long as the exchange markets are as volatile as they are."
      On the other hand, he said that, barring a collapse of the
  dollar, he did not see rates going much higher.
      He said that Morgan's recent rise in its prime lending rate
  was "purely a reflection of an increase in a whole spectrum of
  rates."
      Preston reiterated earlier company forecasts that the U.S.
  economy should show roughly 2.5 to three pct real growth this
  year.
      He also said that as a consequence of the dollar's decline
  and oil price rises, inflation would rise "moderately" to a 3.5
  to four pct rate in 1987.
