FUEL STORAGE TANKS IN FRANCE BURST INTO FLAMES
  Two people were missing and six
  injured after tanks containing thousands of cubic metres of
  fuel burst into flames today at a Shell storage unit in Lyon,
  rescue workers said.
      The blaze broke out with an explosion around 1330 local
  time (1130 GMT). Shell is a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell
  Group &lt;RD>.
      Some 200 firemen fought the flames at the gasoline storage
  unit at Edouard Herriot riverside port complex and appeared to
  have the blaze under control as night fell. The entire southern
  section of Lyon was cordoned off.
      The fire destroyed five giant tanks and threatened four
  others, the Shell spokesman said. He said that the company
  estimated between six and seven thousand cubic metres of
  domestic fuel oil, gasoline and additives had been burned.
      The total capacity of the burning tanks was over 10,000
  cubic metres, but some had been empty when an explosion started
  today's fire, he added.
