CANADA ALLOWS PUBLISHING TAKEOVER BY HARCOURT
  Investment Canada said it has allowed the
  indirect takeover of Holt, Rinehart and Winston Canada Ltd.,
  W.B. Saunders Co of Canada Ltd and Les Editions HRW Ltd by
  Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Canada Inc.
      The government agency said, however, Harcourt Canada has
  agreed to sell control of the firms to Canadian interests
  within two years.
      Harcourt Canada's U.S. parent, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich
  Inc &lt;HBJ>, indirectly acquired the Canadian book publishing
  companies when it purchased Holt Rinehart and Winston from CBS
  Inc &lt;CBS> last October.
