JAPAN HAS NO PLANS FOR NEW MEASURES TO AID DLR
  Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said
  Japan has no plans to take new emergency measures to support
  the dollar, other than foreign exchange intervention.
      He also told reporters that many major nations yesterday
  intervened heavily to support the dollar against the yen.
      Yesterday's intervention was large in terms of the
  countries involved and the amounts expended, he said.
      With the continued fall of the dollar against the yen,
  0speculation had arisen in currency markets here that Japan
  might take new measures to support the U.S. Currency, such as
  curbing capital outflows.
      Miyazawa said that yesterday's news of a 4.3 pct rise in
  U.S. Gnp in the first quarter had been expected. Although the
  growth looks robust on the surface, the figures in reality are
  not that good, he said.
      He said the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is
  expected to come up with a final set of recommendations of ways
  to stimulate the Japanese economy before Prime Minister
  Yasuhiro Nakasone leaves for Washington next week.
      Commenting on yesterday's report on economic restructuring
  by a high-level advisory panel to Nakasone, Miyazawa said it
  was important to put the panel's recommendations into effect.
