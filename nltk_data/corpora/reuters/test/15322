U.S.SENATE LIFTS SOME BANS ON NATURAL GAS
  The Senate unanimously approved
  legislation to lift a ban on new construction of natural
  gas-fired power plants and other large industrial gas-burning
  plants.
      The bill, sponsored by Senate Energy Committee chairman
  Bennett Johnston, also repeals mandatory incremental pricing of
  natural gas which was designed to protect residential consumers
  from major price increases by forcing some industrial users to
  pay higher than market prices.
      "This legislation will open up new natural gas markets," the
  Lousiana Democrat said.
      The gas restrictions were enacted in 1978 in response to a
  shortage of natural gas and predictions of higher prices.
      "Now both oil and gas prices are severely depressed,"
  Johnston said.
      In a compromise with coal producers, the bill requires new
  baseload electric powerplants be designed to accomodate
  modifications necessary to burning coal or another alternate
  fuel.
