DEUTSCHE BANK CHIEF SAYS LOUVRE PACT STILL INTACT
  Deutsche Bank AG joint chief executive
  Friedrich Wilhelm Christians said he believed the Louvre accord
  on currency stability was still intact.
      Christians told a news conference he met U.S. Treasury
  Secretary James Baker in the last two weeks, after short term
  German interest rates had risen twice.
      "I am sure that with 1.7720 marks the dollar is still within
  the Louvre agreement. I do not see that the accord has been
  terminated," Christians said. He was responding to questions
  about comments by Baker, who said the Louvre accord was still
  operative but criticised rises in West German interest rates.
