CANADIAN PACIFIC (CP) UNIT STUDIES PULP MILL
  CIP Inc, wholly-owned by Canadian
  Pacific Ltd, is considering building a pulp mill in Texas which
  would use kenaf fibre instead of wood, CIP president Cecil
  Slenniken said in an interview.
       The kenaf plant is a member of the hibiscus family and was
  artificially developed several years ago. The plant, which has
  been grown in Southern Texas, reaches a height of 10 feet in
  three months and is said to produce better quality newsprint
  than wood pulp, a CIP official said.
       Slenniken said the company has commissioned studies for a
  200,000 tonne capacity pulp mill which would use the fibre but
  would need partners to begin the project.
      "We are not yet ready to commit the hundreds of millions of
  dollars it would take for such a project," Slenniken said.
       He said CIP has been using the pulp on a trial basis to
  make newsprint containing 90 pct kenaf fibre and 10 pct
  softwood fibre at its Trois-Rivieres, Quebec plant.
      CIP, Canada's second largest newsprint producer, recently
  launched a 366 mln Canadian dlr newsprint mill at Gold River,
  British Columbia which is due begin producing 230,000 metric
  tonnes per year by fall of 1989.
