PHILIPPINE COCONUT CHIEF TO LOBBY AGAINST EC TAX
  Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA)
  chairman Jose Romero said he would visit Brussels later this
  month to lobby against a proposed 100 pct European Community
  (EC) levy on vegetable oil imports.
      "I intend to visit Brussels and talk to whoever is putting
  up this devilish scheme to impoverish third world countries
  like the Philippines," Romero said in an interview.
      He said he did not know how much support the levy had
  within the EC but he said he believed those originally opposed
  to the tax were under pressure to change their position.
      Romero said a group of EC members led by West Germany, the
  Netherlands, Denmark and Norway were opposed to the tax. But
  there was a danger some of them would be persuaded to change
  sides, and if that happened opposition could crumble.
      Romero said another threat to exports lay in an EC warning
  that copra meal cake used in livestock feeds contained
  dangerous levels of aflatoxin, a carcinogenic chemical.
      He said the EC standard of 0.02 parts of aflatoxin per
  million parts of meal, which EC countries had been asked to
  apply by October 1988, was too rigid. He said Philippine copra
  cake contained much higher levels of aflatoxin.
      Aflatoxin comes from moulds which develop in copra when it
  is not properly dried or ground.
      Romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal in
  London that the Philippines was doing its best to meet EC
  standards. It was also trying to eliminate aflatoxin totally,
  but this was likely to take several years of research.
      Copra meal exports were 817,641 tonnes or 35 pct of total
  coconut exports in 1986. The meal was worth 73.5 mln dlrs.
      Romero said he would also visit Oxford University's
  department of agricultural economics to discuss ways of
  avoiding the copra process altogether.
      "There are ways of producing coconut products outside of
  copra," Romero said. "We can process fresh coconut without drying
  the meat in the sun. Through the wet process we can process
  coconuts into other food or non-food products, or we can go to
  the chemical root."
      He said there was a tendency for agricultural countries to
  become more protectionist and he expected export prices of
  coconut products to drop.
      "In the long term we will be getting less and less for more
  and more production, and I'm not comfortable with that," he
  said.
      With countries like Indonesia and Malaysia stepping up
  production of palm oil, a coconut oil substitute, palm oil
  output had risen nearly 70 pct since 1971, Romero said.
      "To add to that the U.S. Soybean Association is spending
  billions of dollars to discredit palm oil and coconut oil by
  saying that they are polysaturated fats and bad for the heart,"
  he said.
      Romero said he expected coconut product export prices to
  stay up for the rest of the year. They would probably touch a
  high of 20 cents/pound from the current level of 18.59 cents,
  and a sharp rise from year-ago levels of 10.50 cents.
      Romero said the Philippines was at the end of a five-year
  coconut production cycle which showed production tended to fall
  after two successive years of good harvests.
      He said 1985 and 1986 were good harvests and this year, to
  add to the production fall, drought had affected output.
      "Traders are stocking up and when they have overbought the
  prices will start declining again. The only sure way to keep
  prices stable is by processing, adding more value," he said.
      Coconut farmers were being encouraged to intercrop by
  planting other cash crops between coconut trees, he said.
      "A typical farm may have from 100 to 150 trees sitting on
  10,000 square metres of land. That's a lot of space," Romero
  said. He said the government's proposed land reform program
  would exclude about 75 pct of the coconut farmers because they
  had less than the proposed seven-hectares of land.
      "If the idea of land reform is to increase income levels,
  production and employment then it won't happen," he said.
      PCA figures show about one-third of the country's
  population is dependent on the coconut industry.
      Coconuts are planted on about 3.2 mln hectares or
  one-fourth of total agricultural land.
