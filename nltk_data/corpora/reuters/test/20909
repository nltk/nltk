IRAN FOREIGN MINISTER TELLS CUBA OF GULF SITUATION
  Iranian foreign minister ali akbar
  velayati, here on a two-day official visit, informed cuban
  foreign ministry officials on monday on the tense situation in
  the gulf, diplomatic sources said.
      They said the envoy's trip, to be followed from tuesday by
  a visit to nicaragua, could be linked to a possible mediation
  of the non-aligned movement in the seven-year-old iran-iraq war
  but they ruled out any prominent cuban role in it.
      Velayati could not be reached for comment on the U.S.
  Attack on an abandoned iranian oil rig on monday which tehran
  vowed to avenge.
