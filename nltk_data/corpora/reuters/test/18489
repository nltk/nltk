AUSTRALIA TO PRODUCE SILVER AND PLATINUM COINS
  The Australian government has given
  support in principle to the production of platinum and silver
  bullion coins at the Perth Mint, Treasurer Paul Keating said.
      This followed the success of the Australian Nugget gold
  bullion coins launched this year, he said in a statement.
      He said that, as with the Australian nuggets, the coins
  would be legal tender. The platinum coins would be made in four
  weights but the silver coin would be of one ounce weight.
      He said detailed arrangements for their issue would be
  finalised after talks between the Federal authorities and the
  Western Australian government, owner of the Perth Mint.
