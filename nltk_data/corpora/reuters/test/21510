PAPERS SAY VENEZUELAN CENTRAL BANK CHIEF TO RESIGN
  Venezuelan Central Bank President Hernan
  Anzola has submitted his resignation and asked President Jaime
  Lusinchi to transfer him to a post in the oil industry, two
  leading Venezuelan newspapers reported.
      The El Universal and El Nacional papers said Anzola would
  leave his position soon. Lusinchi already has decided on his
  successor, the El Nacional reported.
      Central Bank officials were not available for comment.
  
      Banking sources said Anzola differed with the Finance
  Ministry over economic policy, particularly over the direction
  of interest rates. He favoured raising the rates, which are
  currently well below the annual inflation rate of 33.2 pct.
      But the sources said he ran into opposition from Finance
  Ministry and government officials who thought an interest
  increase would fuel inflation.
