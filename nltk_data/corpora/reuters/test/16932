JAPAN WILL NOT RETALIATE NOW AGAINST U.S. TARIFFS
  Japan does not plan to take immediate
  retaliatory action against implementation of U.S. Tariffs on
  some Japanese electronic goods, the minister of international
  trade and industry, Hajime Tamura, said in a statement.
      Japan requested bilateral consultations in accordance with
  Article 23-1 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
  (GATT) in Washington yesterday.
      Tamura said there was deep regret over the U.S. Measures,
  which will impose 100 pct tariffs on about 300 mln dlrs worth
  of Japanese imports of some small computers, colour television
  sets and power tools.
