BONN MINISTRY HAS NO COMMENT ON BAKER REMARKS
  The West German Finance Ministry declined to
  comment on weekend criticism by U.S. Treasury Secretary James
  Baker of recent West German interest rate increases.
      Baker said the U.S. Would re-examine the February Louvre
  Accord to stabilise currencies reached by leading industrial
  democracies. The rise in West Germany short term interest rates
  was not in the spirit of an agreement by these nations in
  Washington, which reaffirmed the Louvre pact, he said.
      A Finance Ministry spokesman, asked for an official
  ministry reaction to Baker's remarks, said he could make no
  comment.
