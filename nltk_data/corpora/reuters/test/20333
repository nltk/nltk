IRAN LEADER VOWS REVENGE ON US RAID IN COMING DAYS
  Iran's top war spokesman Ali Akbar
  Hashemi Rafsanjani on Tuesday called the U.S. Attacks on two of
  its Gulf oil platforms an escalation and promised retaliation.
      "God willing, we will carry out our duty in the coming days
  and make them sorry," said Rafsanjani in a speech to Parliament
  later broadcast by Tehran Radio.
      The Tehran leadership have been quick to threaten vengeance
  after the U.S. Raids on the rigs, one of which was destroyed.
      President Ali Khamenei, Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi
  and now Rafsanjani within 24 hours of the U.S. Action have all
  vowed retaliation.
      Rafsanjani, the parliamentary speaker, said, "It is not a
  threat or an attempt at intimidation when we say we will
  respond to aggression -- it is a reality and we have proved it
  in practice." He added that the American attack "squares neither
  with its superpower image nor its claim of concern with
  security, nor reason and wisdom."
      U.S. Warships shelled an Iranian offshore oil platform and
  American special forces boarded another, destroying equipment.
      The U.S. Government said the attack was a measured response
  to an Iranian missile attack on the American-flagged Kuwaiti
  tanker Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters last Friday.
