WEST GERMAN BEET PLANTINGS DELAYED THREE WEEKS
  Unseasonal cold weather has delayed
  sugar beet plantings in West Germany by up to three weeks, the
  agriculture ministry said.
      A ministry spokesman said in some central areas, especially
  in the Rhineland, farmers have taken advantage of warmer
  weather and started plantings in the past two days.
      West German planting intentions this year are put at
  381,000 hectares, down from 390,500 ha last year, he said,
  adding that the 1980/1985 average was 405,000 ha.
