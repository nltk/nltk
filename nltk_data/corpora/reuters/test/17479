CONISTON GROUP TO CONTINUE BID FOR ALLEGIS &lt;AEG>
  An investor group led by Coniston
  Partners said it plans to continue its effort to gain control
  of Allegis Corp despite the defensive maneuvers Allegis
  announced last week.
      Allegis said then that it would borrow three billion dlrs
  and pay shareholders a dividend of 60 dlrs per share, lowering
  the company's net worth. The Coniston group, which owns 13 pct
  of Allegis stock, has said that it would seek shareholder
  consents to remove 13 of the 16 Allegis directors. The group
  had said it would consider breaking up Allegis into its
  airline, hotel and vehicle rental components if it succeeded.
      The Coniston group said it expects to make a further
  announcement today on its plans for Allegis.
      Wall Street analysts and traders had not expected Coniston
  to abandon its pursuit of Allegis as a result of the Allegis
  defensive measures.
      Allegis officials were unavailable for comment.
