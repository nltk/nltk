STOLTENBERG DECLINES COMMENT ON CURRENCY ZONES
  West German Finance Minister Gerhard
  Stoltenberg declined to comment on whether unpublished target
  zones for currencies agreed at last February's Louvre accord
  had been changed as a result of the meeting on Monday with U.S.
  Treasury Secretary James Baker.
      He was asked about target zones at a news conference in
  Bonn. Stoltenberg referred to a statement released after
  Monday's meeting, which said continuing cooperation was aimed
  at promoting currency stability at current levels. This was the
  same formula used in the text of the Louvre accord, he noted.
