NEW CONTAINER CRANES ARRIVE AT TANZANIA PORT
  Two large container cranes donated
  by the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA) have
  arrived in Dar es Salaam where they will help to increase the
  port's cargo handling capacity, port officials said.
      The two new container cranes join one Danish container
  crane already installed in the port, which is an important
  trade outlet for Tanzania, Zambia, Malawi and eastern Zaire.
      Five more cranes from Finland are due to arrive soon,
  increasing the container terminal's handling capacity to
  120,000 units per year from 30,000 at present, the officials
  said.
