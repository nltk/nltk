HIGH WATER EXTENDS RHINE RIVER BLOCKAGE
  Rising water levels on the Rhine caused by
  heavy rain are delaying an operation near Karlsruhe to raise
  two sunken boats which have blocked the river's main navigation
  channel since early last week, a Karlsruhe water authority
  spokesman said.
      He said two floating cranes were unable to begin lifting
  the sunken tug Orinoko and its lighter because the water level
  had reached 815 centimetres and was forecast to rise to 820-830
  cm by tomorrow. He was unable to say when the operation might
  begin.
      Meanwhile, high water at Cologne has forced vessels to
  travel at reduced speed, a water authority spokesman in Cologne
  said. But a water authority spokesman in Duisburg, 60 kms north
  of Cologne, said vessels there were moving normally.
