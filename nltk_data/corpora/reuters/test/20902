ITALY WORRIED AT RISING TENSION AFTER GULF ATTACK
  Italian Prime Minister Giovanni Goria told
  the cabinet on Monday he was worried about the increased
  tension in the Gulf, but said America's retaliation against
  Iran had been limited.
      A statement issued after a cabinet meeting said Goria had
  been informed by the United States that it would take action
  against an Iranian target in the Gulf, but had not known
  beforehand that the action would involve an attack on an oil
  platform.
      "The prime minister expressed his concern over the possible
  consequences of increased tension in the Gulf, at the same time
  recognizing the limited character of the American military
  reaction to the attacks it has suffered in the past few days,"
  the statement said.
      Goria said Italy's own ships were far from the platform at
  the time of the attack and the fleet had been advised to follow
  events with caution.
      Italy has sent eight ships, including three frigates and
  three minesweepers, to the Gulf to protect Italian merchant
  shipping there.
