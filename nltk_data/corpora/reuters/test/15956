FUNDAMENTAL BROKERS BUYS PART OF MKI BROKERS
  Fundamental Brokers Institutional
  Associates, a leading inter-dealer broker in U.S. government
  securities, said it has agreed to acquire certain assets of MKI
  Government Brokers Inc for undisclosed terms.
      Acquisition documents have been signed and are being held
  in escrow pending the receipt of certain consents, it said.
      In conjunction with the sale of assets, MKI has ceased
  brokering treasury bills, notes and bonds, Fundamental said.
      Industry sources told Reuters yesterday that Fundamental
  was close to acquiring the government securities brokerage
  division of MKI, a major broker of corporate bonds.
      Fundamental said it intends to use the facilities formerly
  used by MKI to provide a new block brokering service in the
  most active Treasury issues.
      By separating the execution of wholesale trades from the
  heavy volume of smaller lots, large-scale transactions will be
  facilitated, the company said.
      "The new system is expected to substantially enhance the
  liquidity and effiency of markets," Fundamental said.
      The wholesale brokering service will begin on or around
  April 20.
