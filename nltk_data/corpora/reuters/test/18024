ITALIAN BARLEY CROP REPORTED IN GOOD CONDITION
  Italy's barley crop is generally in good
  condition and harvesting is expected to begin shortly, the
  agricultural marketing information and research board Irvam
  said.
      First consignments were expected to be available around
  mid-June.
      Excellent weather, characterised by alternating periods of
  sunshine and rain, has encouraged growth except in Sardinia,
  which was expected to lose a large part of its barley crop
  because of extreme dryness.
      Irvam said yields are expected higher than last year's low
  levels if favourable weather continues in the next few weeks.
      Given an average yield of 3.5 tonnes per hectare, national
  production would be around two pct higher than in the previous
  season at just above 1.6 mln tonnes, it said.
      If yields reach the record 3.78 tonnes per hectare achieved
  in 1984, production would be around 1.75 mln tonnes, an
  increase of 11 pct compared to 1986.
