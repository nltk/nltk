S.KOREA SEES GNP GROWTH MORE THAN 10 PCT THIS YEAR
  South Korea's gross national product (GNP)
  will exceed 10 pct real growth this year and the won will rise
  further as long as the current account surplus continues to
  widen, Deputy Prime Minister Chun In-Yong told reporters.
      Chung, who is also Minister of Economic Planning, said his
  GNP estimate was based on the assumption that the economy will
  remain stable.
      The official target for 1987 GNP growth is eight pct.
      GNP rose 15.6 pct between the first quarters of 1987 and
  1986, according to provisional Bank of Korea figures.
      GNP rose 12.5 pct in calendar 1986.
      In the first four months of this year, the current account
  swung to a surplus of 2.5 billion dlrs from a deficit of 294
  mln dlrs in the same 1986 period.
      "What the Minister said does not imply any major economic
  policy change," a Ministry spokesman told Reuters. "But he tried
  to urge business circles to prepare for the forseeable economic
  (future) ... A high won era."
      South Korean manufacturers, who have insisted the won
  should not rise more than seven pct this year, have said they
  plan to ask the government to slow down its appreciation
  against the dollar.
      The Bank of Korea today quoted the won unchanged at 812.05
  against the dollar, a 6.02 pct gain so far this year compared
  with a 3.34 pct increase for the whole of 1986.
      The won strengthened by 6.60 won to the dollar in three
  days earlier this month while an International Monetary Fund
  team held talks here to discuss revaluation.
