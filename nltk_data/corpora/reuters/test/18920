REYNOLDS METALS &lt;RLM> TO RESTART IDLE POTLINE
  Reynolds Metals co said it plans
  to restart the last idle potuction line at its Troutdale, Ore.,
  primary aluminum plant.
      With the restart of this 22,700-metric-tonne-per-year line,
  Reynolds said, it will be operating at 100 pct of its
  consolidated primary aluminum capacity of 695,000 tonnes per
  year.
      Reynolds said work will commence on the potline restart in
  the near future and it is expected that actual metal production
  will begin on September one.
      The company said the start up was necessitated by
  continuing strong demand for aluminum and dwindling worldwide
  inventories, and that the metal is needed to supply Reynolds'
  various fabricating businesses.
