MALAYSIAN RUBBER OUTPUT RECOVERS FROM WINTERING
  Malaysian rubber production should
  return to normal levels this month after a hard wintering
  season, the Malaysian Rubber Exchange and Licensing Board said
  in its latest review. "As packers and remillers expect
  production to recover to normal levels in June, sellers will
  remain reserved in the near future," the review, dated May 14,
  said. Many consumers are holding off, waiting for the best time
  to buy.
      The market is mindful of approaching summer holidays in
  industrial countries and there is an air of uncertainty beyond
  July, it said. It gave no figures for the output drop.
