UAE TRADE, CURRENT ACCOUNT SURPLUSES NARROW
  The United Arab Emirates recorded a
  1986 trade surplus of 12.2 billion dirhams, narrowing from 30.2
  billion in 1985, the central bank's latest bulletin shows.
      The central bank said the lower surplus was mainly due to
  the decline in the value of exports and re-exports to 37.2
  billion dirhams from 54.2 billion in 1985. This reflected the
  decline in oil prices last year and difficulties in marketing
  UAE oil, the central bank added.
      The surplus on the current account narrowed to 6.8 billion
  dirhams from 25.5 billion in 1985. The overall balance showed a
  surplus of 4.8 billion after 2.6 billion in 1985.
