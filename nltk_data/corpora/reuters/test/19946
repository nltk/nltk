A.H. ROBINS &lt;QRAH> TO CONSIDER RORER OFFER
  A.H. Robins Co said its board
  has concluded that the merger proposal submitted by Rorer Group
  Inc &lt;ROR> merits further consideration.
      At the request of the board, Rorer has agreed to extend
  until 1800 EDT July 2 its deadline for response from A.H.
  Robins.
      After Rorer announced its second bid for the company last
  Thursday, analysts forecast that the Robins family, which holds
  control of the company, would vigourously oppose any merger.
      But, the analysts added, that Robins desire to emerge
  independent from two years of bankruptcy proceedings may be
  thwarted by some Robins' shareholders who perceive a merger as
  a more expedient way of dealing with the company's Dalkon
  Shield related liabilities.
      After a failed first attempt earlier this year, Rorer's
  latest merger plan calls for a share swap worth about 720 mln
  dlrs.
      Rorer would also set up two trusts to cover the estimated
  1.75 billion dlrs in liabilities to deal with about 320,000
  claims by women who suffered maladies from the use of the
  Dalkon Shield interuterine device.
