NPPC APPEAL ON CANADIAN PORK DISMISSED
  The U.S. Court of International Trade has
  upheld the International Trade Commission's refusal to extend
  countervailing duties on Canadian hogs to include pork
  products, the National Pork Producers' Council said.
      The court's ruling came in an appeal to the Trade
  Commission's decision filed by the Pork Producers' Council.
      Council president Tom Miller said he was disappointed by
  the court ruling and said the council will accelerate
  activities in support of an amendment to the 1930 Tariff Act
  that would address the objections outlined in the Trade
  Commission's ruling.
      The Commission had said there was insufficient economic
  integration between the pork production industry and the pork
  packing industry to justify extending the duty on live hogs to
  fresh, chilled or frozen pork.
      The legislation has already passed the House of
  Representatives and recently passed the Senate Finance
  Committee. It is expected to be considered by the full Senate
  by the end of the summer.
      An appeal by the Canadian Pork Council that the current
  countervailing duty on Canadian hogs entering the U.S. be
  lifted is pending before the Court.
