ALCAN REDUCES COST OF PLANNED SMELTER
  Alcan Aluminium Ltd said it has cut the
  expected cost of its planned Laterriere, Quebec, smelter by
  using enhanced Grande Baie reduction technology.
      The company said the decision to use prebaked anode
  technolgy used at its Grande Baie, Quebec, and Sebree, Ky.,
  smelters was taken primarily for cost reasons.
      As a result, it said, the estimated total cost of the
  planned smelter will be held to 450 mln U.S. dlrs, the low end
  of the range estimated in mid-May, while the cost of the first
  phase was cut to 150 mln dlrs from the projected 175-225 mln
  dlrs.
