COFFEE COULD DROP TO 70/80 CTS, CARDENAS SAYS
  International coffee prices could drop to
  between 70 and 80 cents a lb by next October if no agreement is
  reached to support the market, Jorge Cardenas, manager of
  Colombia's National Coffee Growers' Federation said.
      Speaking at a forum for industrialists, he said one of the
  reasons was that the market was already saturated and that
  producers will have excess production and stockpiles of 39 mln
  (60-kg) bags in 1987.
      Today, May futures in New York settled at 107.90 cents a
  lb.
