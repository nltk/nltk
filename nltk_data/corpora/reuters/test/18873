WEST TEXAS COTTON CROP UNSCATHED BY STORM
  The West Texas cotton crop was largely
  unscathed by an isolated thunderstorm in that region last night
  that packed hurricane-force winds, crop and weather experts
  said.
      "There might have been some isolated storms, but certainly
  nothing damaging," said Charles Stichler, an extension
  agronomist with the Agricultural Extension Service in far West
  Texas.
      Rumors of a damaging storm in West Texas helped the New
  York cotton futures market rally sharply this morning.
     Cotton for December delivery was 1.35 cents higher at 70.95
  cents a lb at midsession after peaking this morning at 71.25
  cents.
      "What happened is that the storm hit Lubbock airport, and
  when that happens, everybody sees it," said Dale Mohler, a
  senior meteorologist with Accu-Weather Inc.
      Lubbock is the heart of the West Texas cotton region, which
  produces about 80 pct of that state's crop.
      The storm produced winds of about 75 mph. "That's hurricane
  force. But they were isolated to just a small portion of the
  West Texas area, probably less than five pct," Mohler said.
      "No doubt there was some damage. But if it had hit in July
  or August (when fruiting would be underway) it would have been
  worse," Mohler said.
      About 60 pct of the West Texas cotton crop has been
  planted, and the remainder could be done by the weekend if
  weather remains hot and dry, Stichler said.
      The temperature in West Texas since mid-week has been about
  95 degrees. But a hot spell was sorely needed after far heavier
  than normal rainfall for several weeks, he said.
