ALLEGIS &lt;AEG> MEETS WITH UNITED EMPLOYEES GROUP
  A spokesman for a group of United
  Airlines employees, who oppose the attempted takeover of United
  by the Airline Pilots Association, said he met with the new
  chairman of Allegis, Frank Olson.
      William Palmer, the group's spokesman, which claims to
  speak for thousands of United employees, said the meeting with
  Olson was "positive and friendly," but no future meeting dates
  were set.
      In April the pilots union offered to buy out United, an
  Allegis subsidiary, through an employee stock ownership plan.
