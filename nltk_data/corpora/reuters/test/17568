BRAZIL NOT SELLING TO COCOA BUFFER STOCK - TRADE
  Brazil is not selling cocoa beans
  to the International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, buffer stock, as
  spot prices for beans in the interior area are 20 to 25 pct
  higher than levels which would be paid by the ICCO buffer stock
  manager, trade sources in the major producing state Bahia said.
      The scarcity of beans because of the effects of drought on
  the current temporao harvest has pushed prices well above
  international levels, the sources noted.
      The only buyers are bean exporters or local processors
  covering previously contracted commitments, they added.
      If sales were made they would be executed by individual
  exporting companies which are members of the Brazilian Cocoa
  Trade Commission, they said.
