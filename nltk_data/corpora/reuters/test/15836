EGYPT CANCELS WHEAT TENDER
  Egypt has cancelled its April 2 tender for
  200,000 tonnes of any origin wheat for April 15-30 shipment,
  trade and Egyptian official sources said.
      Trade sources said the cancellation followed an offer by an
  Egyptian company, Islamic Corp, at 85.80 dlrs/tonne cost and
  freight, undercutting other traders' offers of between 93.90
  and 94.49 dlrs/tonne.
      An Egyptian trade official in Paris confirmed cancellation
  of the tender following the Islamic Corp offer, which he said
  the government had refused for legal reasons.
      The official denied trade reports that the government might
  have substituted a private deal with Islamic Corp for the
  original tender.
