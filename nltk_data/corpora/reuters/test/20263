FED EXPECTED TO ADD RESERVES VIA CUSTOMER RPS
  The Federal Reserve is expected to enter
  the government securities market to add reserves via customer
  repurchase agreements, economists said.
      They expected the amount to total around 1.5 billion to two
  billion dlrs.
      Economists added that the low rate on federal funds
  indicates the Fed is unlikely to add funds agressively through
  overnight system repurchases, unless it feels the need to calm
  volatile financial markets.
      Federal funds were trading at 7-1/8 pct, down from
  yesterday's average of 7.61 pct.
