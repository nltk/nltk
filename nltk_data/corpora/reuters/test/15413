PHILIPPINE TELEPHONE FIRM PLANS STOCK SPLIT
  The Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co
  &lt;PLDT.MN> is planning a two-for-one stock split and a 20 pct
  stock dividend later this year to reduce excess market
  buoyancy, Vice-President Sennen Lazo told Reuters.
      Lazo said the stock split would reduce the par value of the
  company's common stock from 10 to five pesos.
      He said the stock split would apply to holders of about 18
  mln common shares of stock on the record date of September 15
  1987. "The exercise should make our stock more marketable," Lazo
  said. "Now it is beyond the reach of many small investors."
      PLDT common stock surged from a low of 37 pesos in February
  1986 to 367.50 at close of trading yesterday on the Manila
  Stock Exchange.
      Lazo said the 20 pct stock dividend, payable on October 15,
  would also apply to stockholders on record as of September 15.
      PLDT reported 1986 net income of 1.89 billion pesos, up 68
  pct from 778.9 mln pesos in 1985, on operating revenues of six
  billion pesos, up from 4.7 billion pesos in 1985.
      At end December 1986 the company had 417,100 stockholders.
      A PLDT spokesman said the company's profits are likely to
  be substantial since the government raised its franchise tax to
  three pct from two and to impose a 35 pct corporate income tax
  from which it was previously exempt.
      The government has not so far ordered the implementation of
  the tax decision.
      PLDT is the largest of 58 telephone companies in the
  Philippines. On December 31 1986 the company had 856,014
  telephones in operation, representing 94 pct of all instruments
  in the country.
