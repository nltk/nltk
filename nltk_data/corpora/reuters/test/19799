  Di Giorgio Corp said it plans to

  Gabelli and Co Inc after the company, its board and its
  investment bankers evaluate the proposal.

  Exchange Commission that it holds a 28.5 pct stake in DiGiorgio
  and that it, together with Gamco Investors Inc may seek control
  of the company.
      In addition, on June 25 the Gabelli group proposed to
  acquire all of Di Giorgio's common shares for a combination of
  20 dlrs per share in cash, a subordinated note with a face
  value of eight dlrs and one common share of the post-buyout
  company.
      The June 25 buyout proposal remains open until July 17.
