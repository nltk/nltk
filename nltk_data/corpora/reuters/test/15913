SONY CHAIRMAN FORECASTS LOWER PROFITS THIS YEAR
  Sony Corp &lt;SNE.T> chairman Akio
  Morita said Sony's profits would be sharply down in 1987 as a
  result of the dollar's decline.
      Sony Corp posted net consolidated income of 41.89 billion
  yen (290 million dollars) in 1986, 42.6 pct down on 1985's
  73.02 billion yen (506 million dollars).
      But Morita added that Japan would benefit from the strong
  yen by saving on its energy import bill and he expected profits
  to recover from 1988 onwards.
      He was speaking to reporters at a sony factory opening
  here.
