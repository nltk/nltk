U.K. MONEY MARKET DEFICIT FORECAST AT 400 MLN STG
  The Bank of England said it forecast a
  shortage of around 400 mln stg in the money market today.
      Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing
  in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain
  some 1.085 billion stg.
      Partly offsetting these outflows, a fall in note
  circulation will add some 340 mln stg, exchequer transactions
  around 300 mln and bankers' balances above target about 50 mln.
