NORANDA BEGINS MURDOCHVILLE MINE SALVAGE
  Noranda Inc said it began salvage
  operations at its Murdochville, Quebec mine where a fire last
  week killed one miner and caused 10 mln dlrs in damage.
       Noranda said the cause and full extent of the damage is
  still unknown but the fire destroyed 6,000 feet of conveyor
  belt.
      The company said extreme heat from the fire caused severe
  rock degradation along several ramps and drifts in the mine.
      Production at the mine has been suspended until
  investigations are complete. The copper mine and smelter
  produced 72,000 tons of copper anodes in 1986.
       The smelter continues to operate with available
  concentrate from stockpiled supplies, Noranda said.
