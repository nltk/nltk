MULTIFOODS &lt;IMC> FILES SUIT AGAINST BREGMAN
  International Multifoods Corp
  said it filed a suit charging Bregman Partners and its
  affiliates unlawfully planned to acquire control of the
  company.
      In a suit filed in U.S. District Court, International
  Multifoods said Bregman Partners and its affiliates, who
  reportedly hold 7.4 pct of the company's shares, tried to
  induce Multifood's management to join them in an effort to take
  the company private and give controlling interest to Bregman
  Partners. Bregman Partners include the interests of the
  Belzberg families of Canada.
      The complaint also discloses that on each occasion,
  Multifoods management rejected the group's overtures.
      Multifoods is asking Bregman's group to divest its shares
  in open market sales in a manner not to further disrupt the
  market place, according to the suit. The suit seeks
  compensatory and punitive damages in an amount to be
  determined.
      In addition, Multifoods is seeking to stop Bregman Partners
  from acquiring any more stock, or voting the shares it
  reportedly owns, the suit said.
      According to Multifoods, the actions proposed by Bregman
  Partners would prevent shareholders from realizing the full
  benefits of the company's restructuring.
      In the past three years, Multifoods has substantially
  altered its domestic business mix by divesting its U.S.
  consumere foods operations and emphasizing growth in selected
  segments of the U.S. foodservice industry.
