MAJOR U.S. PIPELINE MAY BE CLOSED SEVERAL DAYS
  The operator of a major U.S. crude oil
  pipeline, shutdown because of flood damage, said it may be
  several days before repairs are made and the system is
  functioning again.
      Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs at
  Texaco Inc &lt;TX>, operator of the pipeline through its
  subsidiary Texaco Pipeline Co, said the company hopes repairs
  will begin in about five days and expects it to take several
  more days to complete.
      "At this point we are lining up what we know we need, to get
  the job done," Stevens said, adding that the timing for repairs
  will depend on the damage to the pipeline which is difficult to
  assess because of flooding on the Red River.
      The pipeline was shipping roughly 225,000 barrels of crude
  oil per day, or about 55 pct of its capacity during the 30 days
  preceding its shutdown on Saturday, Stevens said.
      The pipeline was shut down from Cushing, Okla, to Witchita
  Falls, Kan, on Saturday due to an undetermined leak at the Red
  River crossing, near the Oklahoma/Texas border, because of
  severe rains, a spokesman for Texaco said.
      Stevens said it was reasonable to suggest the pipeline
  could operate at full capacity when it reopens in order to make
  up for the shortfull but cautioned they will talk with
  customers to determine their requirements.
      Oil analysts and traders said they were not sure if the 
  shutdown will continue to raise U.S. oil prices.
      Monday, after Texaco confirmed that the pipeline had been
  closed, West Texas Intermediate crude in the spot market and on
  New York Mercantile Exchange's energy futures complex rose 20
  cts a barrel.
