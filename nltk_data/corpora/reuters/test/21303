STOLTENBERG ASSUMES COOPERATION WILL CONTINUE
  The West German government assumes that the
  commitment to international monetary cooperation which was
  renewed in Washington last month will continue, a Finance
  Ministry spokesman quoted Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg
  as saying.
      Stoltenberg's statement was a reaction to criticism of
  rises in West German interest rates voiced by U.S. Treasury
  Secretary James Baker over the weekend.
