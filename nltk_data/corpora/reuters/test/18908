EC REJECTS LICENCES FOR SPANISH BARLEY
  The EC Commission cereals management
  committee rejected all bids for licences to export free market
  Spanish barley to non-EC countries, trade sources said.
      The licence requests were for 35,000 tonnes at between 143
  and 145 European Currency Units (ECUs), they said.
      This tender was part of a special tender for 500,000 tonnes
  of Spanish barley.
      The sources said there had been no bids for licences for
  free market soft wheat and non-Spanish barley exports to non-EC
  countries.
