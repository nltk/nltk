SPANISH MONEY SUPPLY GROWING AT DOUBLE TARGET PACE
  Spain's principal measure of money
  supply, the broad-based liquid assets in public hands (ALP),
  grew at an annualised rate of 17.6 pct in March against 16.6
  pct in February and 19.6 pct in March last year, provisional
  Bank of Spain figures show.
      The bank's target range for this year is 6.5 to 9.5 pct,
  and Bank of Spain Governor Mariano Rubio said this month he was
  aiming for the lower end of that range.
      ALP grew by 11.4 pct during 1986.
