EC LAUNCHES ANTI-DUMPING PROBE ON JAPANESE CHIPS
  The European Community launched an
  investigation into allegations of dumping by Japanese
  semiconductor makers in a move which diplomats said could mark
  an intensification of world trade strains.
      Tokyo already faces a deadline of April 17 from Washington
  for the imposition of 300 mln dlrs worth of tariffs on chips it
  imports into the U.S.
      The EC Executive Commission said today the European
  Electrical Component Manufacturers Association complained that
  Japanese firms were selling high capacity EPROM type (erasable
  programmable read only memory) chips at unfairly low prices.
      Japan last year took 78 pct of the 170 mln dlr EC EPROM
  market, up from 60 pct in 1984. The EC firms said they had been
  forced to offer their products at a discount of up to 30 pct in
  order to compete with the Japanese.
      The Commission said it believed the Association had given
  sufficient elements of proof for dumping to warrant an
  investigation, which could lead it to impose duties if it found
  the complaints were justified.
      The Commission claims last year's accord between the U.S.
  And Japan on microchip pricing gives U.S. Firms privileged
  access to the Japanese market.
