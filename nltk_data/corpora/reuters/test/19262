COLD, WET WEATHER SLOWS BEET GROWTH IN W. EUROPE
  Cold and wet weather in northern,
  western and central parts of Europe continued to slow beet
  growth but plant density is reported to be good in most
  countries, sugar statistician F.O. Licht said.
      Temperatures were too low for the season and the rain has
  hampered field work and occasionally led to water-logged
  fields.
      But in eastern and southeastern Europe, warmer weather has
  boosted sugar beet growth.
      Weather in the Soviet Union also allowed good beet
  development, Licht said.
      In Sweden beet growth has been delayed, although plant
  population is reported to be regular and good. Cool and rainy
  weather slowed beet growth in Denmark and crop prospects are
  rated as slightly below normal.
      In the United Kingdom and Ireland, it was rather cool with
  heavy rainfall in places which has delayed beet growth.
      In France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and West Germany, it
  was mostly cool with frequent and often heavy rainfall which
  continued to slow down beet growth and often made field work
  impossible.
      In Austria, it was warm with some rainfall, which was
  favourable for beet growth, Licht said.
      In Czechoslovakia and Poland, it was mostly warm, favouring
  beet development. but some heavy rain may have caused damage.
      In the European beet growing regions of the Soviet Union,
  it was warm with showers over most areas and weather was
  generally good for the emergence and growth of beets.
      In south eastern Europe, warm weather with some rainfall
  boosted beet development.
      Labour trouble threatens the beet crop in Spain. Disputes
  between the factories and the trade unions are threatening to
  delay the start of processing in the southern areas, where
  beets are maturing very early this year.
