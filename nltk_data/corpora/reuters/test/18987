HIGHER GROWTH, UNEMPLOYMENT IN FRANCE, OECD SAYS
  France's growth rate is expected to
  strengthen in the second half of this year after a poor first
  half, but unemployment will worsen, the Organisation for
  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.
      In its semi-annual review of the world economy, the OECD
  forecast that growth in the French Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
  would run at about two pct in the next six months. It said the
  rate would be in line with the 1986 trends, but significantly
  higher than in the first half of this year.
      The OECD said France's economic situation has deteriorated
  somewhat during the early months of 1987. 
      Activity has slowed, primarily reflecting an inventory
  adjustment, while unemployment has risen rapidly and inflation
  has reaccelerated, the OECD said. Unemployment is likely to
  reach 12 pct of the workforce by the end of 1988.
      The report said inflation should slow and domestic demand
  pick up in the second half of this year. But both data are
  likely to be worse than those recorded in 1986, it added.
      The OECD forecast a 2.75 pct rise in consumer prices for
  the second half of this year, a one pct drop from the first six
  months. The slowdown would bring the inflation rate to 3.25 pct
  for the whole year, sharply up from last year's 2.2 pct.
