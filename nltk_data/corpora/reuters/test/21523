ANIMAL FEED SHIP ON FIRE AGAIN AT CHINESE PORT
  The Cyprus vessel Fearless, 31,841 tonnes
  dw, which was on fire, grounded then towed to Yantai, China, in
  August, had all its cargo reloaded but the cargo in the no. 3
  hold caught fire on October 15.
      The fire was put out with salt water and water from the
  no.4 hold has spread over most of the cargo. Some water is also
  in the no.5 hold. Bottom patching was reported complete but
  only the no.4 starboard wing tank has been pumped out and
  remains dry. The engine room is flooded to about three metres.
      The ship was originally loaded with 10,000 tonnes of animal
  feed.
