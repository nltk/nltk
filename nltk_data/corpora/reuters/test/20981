U.S. FORCES DESTROYED OIL RIG, RAIDED ANOTHER
  U.S. warships destroyed an Iranian oil
  platform in the Gulf on Monday and the Navy also raided a
  second oil rig in retaliation for Friday's Iranian missile
  attack on a U.S. flag tanker, the Pentagon said.
      President Reagan and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger
  warned Iran of even stronger countermeasures if the military
  escalation between the two countries continued in the volatile
  waterway.
      Reagan said he ordered the strike on the first platform by
  four U.S. destroyers, which fired about 1,000 five-inch shells
  at the Rostam oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain in the central
  Gulf.
      A short time later, Navy personnel boarded a second Iranian
  oil platform about five miles to the north and destroyed radar
  and communications equipment before leaving the structure, the
  Pentagon said.
       Defense Department spokesman Fred Hoffman told reporters
  that the second platform had been abandoned by Iranian
  personnel during the shelling and destruction of the first rig.
      The United States said both platforms were being used to
  keep track of Gulf merchant shipping and to launch speedboat
  attacks on such shipping by Iranian Revolutionary guards.
