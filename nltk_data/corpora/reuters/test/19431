NORANDA BRUNSWICK MINERS VOTE MONDAY ON CONTRACT
  Noranda Inc said 1,100 unionized workers
  at its 63 pct-owned Brunswick Mining and Smelter Corp lead-zinc
  mine in New Brunswick would start voting Monday on a tentative
  contract pact.
      Company official Andre Fortier said "We are hopeful that we
  can settle without any kind of work interruption."
      Fortier added that Brunswick's estimated 500 unionized
  smelter workers were currently meeting about a Noranda contract
  proposal and would probably vote next week. The mine's contract
  expires July 1 and the smelter's on July 21.
      The Brunswick mine produced 413,800 tonnes of zinc and
  206,000 tonnes of lead last year at a recovery rate of 70.5 pct
  zinc and 55.6 pct lead. Concentrates produced were 238,000
  tonnes of zinc and 81,000 tonnes of lead.
