TOP OFFICIALS ARRIVE AT TREASURY FOR G-5 TALKS
  Top officials of leading industrial
  nations arrived at the U.S. Treasury main building to begin a
  meeting of the Group of Five.
      Officials seen arriving by Reuter correspondents included
  West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and Bundesbank
  President Karl Otto Poehl, French Finance Minister Edouard
  Balladur and his central banker Jacques de Larosiere.
      Also seen arriving were Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi
  Miyazawa and Japan's central bank governor Satoshi Sumita and
  British Chancellor of the Exchequer and central bank governor
  Robin Leigh Pemberton.
      There was no immediate sign of Italian or Canadian
  officials. Monetary sources have said a fully blown meeting of
  the Group of Seven is expected to begin around 3 p.m. local
  time (1900 gmt) and last at least until 6 p.m. (2200 gmt), when
  a communique is expected to be issued.
      Italian sources said Italian acting Finance Minister
  Giovanni Goria met Treasury Secretary James Baker last night.
      At those talks Baker apparently convinced Goria, who
  declined to attend the February meeting of the Group of Seven
  in Paris, that Italy would participate fully in any meaningful
  decisions.
