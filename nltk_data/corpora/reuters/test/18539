U.K. UNEMPLOYMENT FALLS BELOW THREE MLN IN MAY
  U.K. Unemployment fell a record
  provisional, seasonally-adjusted 64,300 in May to a total 2.95
  mln or 10.6 pct of the workforce, the Employment Department
  said.
      In April, seasonally-adjusted unemployment fell by an
  upwardly revised 21,600 to 3.02 mln or 10.9 pct, it said.
      The unadjusted jobless total in May, including school
  leavers, alos fell a record 121,000 to 2.99 mln or 10.8 pct
  from April's 3.11 mln, 11.2 pct.
      May was the eleventh successive decline from a peak last
  summer of 11.6 pct, the Employment Department said.
      "Unemployment has fallen to under three mln for the first
  time in over three years. The May fall of 64,000 was the
  largest drop since records were first kept (in 1948),"
  Employment Minister Norman Fowler said.
      All regions have seen above average falls in long term
  unemployment during the past year, he added.
      The last time the adjusted total of unemployed was below
  three mln was July 1984, while the unadjusted total was last
  below this level in June 1983.
