PARIS GROUP PUBLISHING DAILY FRANC TIN PRICE
  The Association of White Metals has
  decided to publish a daily tin price here in French francs per
  100 kilos, the French Federation of Non-Ferrous Metals said.
      The price, quoted for the first time yesterday, was
  introduced as the lack of tin quotes was causing problems for
  some French companies, a spokesman for the non-ferrous metals
  association said.
      Today's price was set at 4,776 francs per 100 kilos and
  Tuesday's at 4,790.
      The International Chamber of Commerce stopped publishing a
  tin price after the London Metal Exchange (LME) stopped tin
  trading on October 24, 1985.
      The Association has tested the basis it uses to calculate a
  French franc price over the last few months to ensure it was
  reliable, the spokesman said.
      The French franc price is pre-tax, for specified quality, a
  minimum 99.9 pct purity, at a French port or border railway
  station and a minimum delivery of 10 tonnes.
      The French Federation of Non-Ferrous Metals groups various
  metal associations including the Association of White Metals.
