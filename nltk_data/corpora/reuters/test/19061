JAPAN PANEL URGES WORLD ECONOMIC ADJUSTMENTS
  Japan could avoid a sharp rise in the
  value of the yen against the dollar if Japan, the U.S. And
  other nations succeeded in restructuring their economies, an
  advisory panel to the government's Economic Planning Agency
  (EPA) said.
      The advisory body said in its report that the yen would
  soar against the dollar if structural adjustments on a global
  basis were delayed.
      An EPA official told Reuters the dollar could fall to
  slightly below 100 yen by 1993 if Japan and the U.S. Failed to
  restructure their economies.
      The dollar's fall without structural adjustments would cut
  Japan's current account surplus to two pct of gross national
  product (GNP) in 1993, the report said. It said such a change
  would slow real GNP growth to an average of two pct annually
  during the seven-year period to 1993.
      If the two nations restructured their economies, the dollar
  would remain stable in real terms, while reducing Japan's
  current-account surplus to 2.1 pct of GNP in 1993. This
  scenario put Japan's GNP growth at 3.5 pct a year.
      It forecast real growth of three pct for the world economy
  and four pct for Japan by 2,000 if the adjustments were made.
