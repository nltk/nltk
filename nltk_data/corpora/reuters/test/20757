BRAZIL'S SEPT TRADE SURPLUS HIGHEST OF THE YEAR
  Brazil's September trade surplus
  was the best so far this year, totalling 1.494 billion dlrs,
  compared with 1.434 billion dlrs in August and 540 mln dlrs in
  September last year, Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade Department
  (Cacex) director Namir Salek said in a news conference.
      September exports were 2.694 billion dlrs, slightly down
  from 2.76 billion dlrs in August. Imports in September amounted
  to 1.2 billion dlrs, against 1.32 billion dlrs in August.
      Salek said the accumulated surplus in the Jan-Sept period
  was 7.857 billion dlrs, compared with 8.667 billion dlrs in a
  similar 1986 period.
      Coffee accounted with 320 mln dlrs of exports, up from 222
  mln dlrs in August and 212 mln in September 1986, Salek said.
      The Cacex director said he expected the country's trade
  surplus to average 800 mln dlrs in the remaining three months
  of the year, estimating the year's overall surplus to reach
  10.2 billion dlrs, from 25.6 billion dlrs worth of exports and
  15.4 billion dlrs of imports.
      He attributed the good surplus on exports of manufactured
  and semimanufactured goods. He mentioned car exports, which
  accounted alone with sales of 617 mln dlrs in the Jan-Sept
  period, against 194 mln dlrs in a similar 1986 period.
