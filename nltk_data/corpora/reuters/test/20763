CANADA PANEL ADVISES CUTTING U.S. CORN DUTY
  The Canadian Import Tribunal said the
  countervailing duty on U.S. corn imports should be cut to 30
  Canadian cts a bushel from 1.10 dlrs a bushel.
      In a report to the Canadian finance department, the
  tribunal said the duty is hurting Canadian farmers and food
  processors. The duty was imposed last year after the revenue
  department found U.S. corn production was subsidized.
      It is now up to the government to decide whether to change
  the duty.
