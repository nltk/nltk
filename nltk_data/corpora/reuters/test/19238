RHINE BLOCKED FOR THREE MORE WEEKS - SALVAGER
  Dutch salvage firm Smit-Tak said it
  may take some three weeks to lift the Swiss tug Orinoko and its
  lighter Pavo which sank 10 days ago at Karlsruhe in West
  Germany, blocking the Rhine river.
      Smit-Tak, which with its West German subsidiary Harms
  Bergung GmbH was commissioned by the local water authorities to
  raise the vessels, said its lifting fleet was in position and
  divers had made the first inspection.
      Smit is still preparing its final salvage plan and said the
  work would begin on Sunday.
