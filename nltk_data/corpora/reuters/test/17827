DEKALB &lt;DKLBB.O> SELLS HEINOLD HOG MARKET
  Dekalb Corp said it sold its Heinold
  Hog Market Inc to the unit's employees through an Employee
  Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP).
      Terms were not disclosed, but president Bruce Bickner said
  the sale will have a positive, but not substantial, impact on
  DeKalb as a whole.
      The company said the hog marketing unit did not fit with
  its strategy of investing in its core businesses.
