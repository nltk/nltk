IRAN, SOVIETS TO HOLD TALKS ON OIL EXCHANGE DEAL
  Iran and the Soviet Union have
  provisionally agreed to hold talks on a possible exchange of
  Iranian crude oil for finished Soviet oil products, an official
  spokesman said Tuesday.
      Gennady Gerasimov, chief of the Soviet Foreign Ministry's
  Information Directorate, told reporters the agreement had been
  reached during a visit to Moscow last week by Iran's Oil
  Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh.
      Gerasimov said no date had been set for the talks, which
  would also study the possibility of Soviet technical assistance
  for Iran's oil industry.
