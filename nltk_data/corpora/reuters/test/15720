EC COMMISSION AUTHORISED TO BUY MAIZE IN JUNE
  The European Commission was authorised
  to buy up to one mln tonnes of maize into intervention stores
  in the second half of June, although sales into intervention
  normally end on April 30, Commission sources said.
      They said approval was given by the EC's Cereals Management
  Committee because of the possible disturbance of the market due
  to heavy imports of maize under the agreement between the EC
  and the United States.
      The agreement guarantees access to the Spanish market for
  two mln tonnes of non-EC maize a year for the next four years.
      The sources said the intervention price for the maize would
  be 201.49 Ecus a tonne.
      They said at this price it seemed unlikely that the full
      They added the decision is also designed to prevent massive
  offers of maize for intervention just ahead of the normal April
  30 deadline, which could be caused by speculation about the
  implementation of the accord with the United States.
