SECURITY COUNCIL CALLS TALKS AFTER GULF ATTACK
  The U.N. Security Council was
  called to a private meeting on Monday for consultations 
  following the United States attack on an Iranian oil platform.
      Meanwhile, a U.N. spokesman said that as far as he knew a
  report to the council and Secretary General Javier Perez de
  Cuellar on the action had not been received from the Americans.
      In Washington, President Reagan said the United Nations was
  being informed of the attack under the provision of the U.N.
  Charter regarding notification of actions taken under the right
  of self-defense.
      The U.N. spokesman, Francois Giuliani, said Perez de
  Cuellar had no comment on the attack, taken in response to
  Iranian action against an American-owned tanker last week, but
  was trying to find out "what actually happened."
      Calls to Iran's U.N. commission elicited no response.
