U.S. MARCH RETAIL SALES CUT BY LATE EASTER
  U.S. retailers' lackluster March sales
  were due to a late Easter, according to analysts who expect a
  recovery in April.
      "Sales look soft because of the Easter shift, but
  underlying business is better than the numbers indicate," said
  Bear Stearns analyst Monroe Greenstein.
       Analysts generally average the sales results of March and
  April to account for the variation of Easter's occurance. This
  year, Easter is being observed on April 19, which is three
  weeks later than last year.
      Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates said
  sales for March rose an unadjusted 2.5 to 3.0 pct, and a
  seasonally adjusted 5.5 pct to six pct, compared to an adjusted
  5.7 pct last year.
      "The obvious question is whether these numbers indicate
  that the consumer activity is slowing, but it does not appear
  to be because liquidity and employment are rising," said
  analyst Jeff Edelman, analyst of Drexel Lambert and Burnham.
      Overall, analysts said first half sales are coming in
  according to expectations. Sales for all of 1987 are expected
  to rise about 5.5 pct to six pct, up a bit from 1986's rise.
       In March, sales of housewares, furniture and big ticket
  items were stronger than apparel sales, signaling to many
  analysts that apparel sales will be strong in April as the
  holiday nears.
      "Sales gains in home appliances and home fashions reflect a
  continuing strength in the housing market," said Edward
  Brennan, chairman of Sears Roebuck and Co &lt;S> which reported an
  overall sales gain of 4.2 pct. Brennan said sales of women's
  sportswear were also excellent.
      "Sears' total apparel sales was up only modestly, but even
  a modest improvement in apparel is a very good accomplishment
  due to the fact that most people will buy apparel in April,"
  said C.J. Lawrence analysts Harry Mortner. 
      J.C. Penney Co Inc &lt;JCP> and Dayton Hudson Corp &lt;DH> were
  among the weaker performers with comparable stores sales
  declining 1.5 pct and 4.9 pct, respectively. Penney's store and
  catalog sales declined 1.3 pct overall and Dayton Hudson's
  overall sales rose 4.8 pct.
      Penney chairman William Howell said, "Sales continued
  strong for catalog operations and, geographically, ranged from
  very active in the east to weak in the economically depressed
  southwest."
      "Penney's been shifting away from leisure time activity
  wear to other apparel lines, which yield higher profit margins,
  but are currently hurting sales," said Greenstein of Bear
  Stearns.
      Hudson chairman Kenneth Mackes cited the late Easter for
  the decline. Edelman of Drexel said that "Hudson had a tougher
  comparison because it had an exceptionally good 1986."
      Most analysts agreed that promotions are slightly lower
  than last year.
      "Retailers are not planning for much - inventories are
  being kept lean, markdowns are lower than last year, but sales
  are coming through anyway," said CJ Analyst Harry Mortner.
      Mortner said he expects profits in the first quarter to  
  be better than he had originally expected in the beginning of
  the year.
      Most retailers report their first quarter in the middle of
  May.
