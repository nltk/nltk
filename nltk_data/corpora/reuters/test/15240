HARTMARX &lt;HMX> TARGETS EARNINGS GROWTH
  Hartmarx Corp, following a year of
  restructuring, continues to target record earnings for fiscal
  1987, Chairman John Meinert told the annual meeting.
      Meinert reiterated an earlier comment that earnings for the
  remainder of the year must double the 1986 level to meet that
  goal. In fiscal 1986, ended November 30, 1986, Hartmarx
  reported earnings of 24.8 mln dlrs, or 1.20 dlrs a share, down
  from the prior year's 42.7 mln dlrs, or 2.25 dlrs a share.
      The 110-year-old apparel manufacturer recently posted
  first-quarter earnings of 54 cts a share, up from 40 cts a year
  ago.
      Meinert told shareholders Hartmarx has no plans to sell any
  of its divisions. He added, "We have the financial capacity to
  take advantage of acquisitions."
      In 1987, Meinert said the company will open five new and 10
  redesigned Kuppenheimer direct-to-consumer stores in Atlanta,
  Detroit, St. Louis, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco.
      He said the company's women's apparel continues to grow,
  and Hartmarx has on the drawing board a Briar concept store
  which will feature ties, shirts and some tailored clothing.
