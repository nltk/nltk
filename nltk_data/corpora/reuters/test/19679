DATACARD &lt;DATC.O> ADOPTS DIVIDEND RIGHTS PLAN
  DataCard Corp said it adopted a
  dividend rights plan in response to Deluxe Check Printers Inc
  &lt;DLX> having agreed to sell its 38 pct interest in DataCard to
  National Computer Systems Inc &lt;NLCS.O>.
      DataCard declared a dividend distribution of one preferred
  stock purchase right on each outstanding share its common
  stock. The dividend is designed to deter National Computer or
  other potential suitors from preventing DataCard from
  evaluating all alternatives to maximize shareholder value,
  DataCard said.
     
      National Computer told Reuters June 22 it could make a bid
  for DataCard. On June 25 DataCard filed suit in Hennepin County
  District Court in Minnesota to block the sale of the 38 pct
  stake of its stock to National Computer.
      In announcing the rights plan, DataCard said it "is not
  designed to deter takeovers that would be consistent with the
  objective of maximizing stockholders value to all of DataCard's
  stockholders."
      The rights will not become exercisable until 10 days after
  an announcement that a person or group has acquired beneficial
  ownership of 44 pct or more of DataCard's common stock.
     
      Once exercisable, each right would entitle a holder to buy
  1/500th of a share of DataCard Series A junior participation
  preferred Stock for 35 dlrs. Holders other than an acquirer
  would be entitled to purchase, for six-months after the right
  becomes exercisable, a number of shares of the new preferred
  stock with a market value equal to twice the exercise price of
  the rights.
      The rights dividend distribution is payable July 9 to
  shareholders of record July 9.
