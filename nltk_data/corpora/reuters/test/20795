REAGAN SAYS U.S. COMMITTED TO LOUVRE ACCORD
  President Reagan said the United
  States remains committed to the Louvre accord in which the
  seven major industrial nations agreed to stabilize currency
  exchange rates.
      "The United States remains committed to the Louvre
  agreement," Reagan said in a statement following a meeting with
  his top economic advisers.
      Reagan said the United States, Japan and West Germany had
  all reaffirmed their commitment to coordinate economic
  policies.
      Reagan said Japanese Prime Minister-designate Noboru
  Takeshita said in a telephone conversation Tuesday morning that
  "his (Takeshita's) top priority was to maintain stable economic
  relations with the United States."
      Reagan noted that Treasury Secretary James Baker met with
  West German financial officials and reaffirmed their commitment
  to the Louvre agreement.
      They "reaffirmed our agreement to coordinate economic
  policies to provide for non-inflationary growth and stable
  exchange rates," Reagan said.
