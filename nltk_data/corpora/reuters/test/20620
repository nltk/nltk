WEST VIRGINIA FREE OF TWO MAJOR CATTLE DISEASES
  West Virginia has been declared free
  of tuberculosis and brucellosis from its cattle population, the
  U.S. Agriculture Department said.
      It said a state is recognized as tuberculosis-free if no
  case of the disease is diagnosed for at least five years and if
  the state complies with the uniform methods and rules of the
  state-federal cooperative eradication program.
      To achieve brucellosis-free status, a state's cattle
  population must remain uninfected for the previous 12 months.
      There are 33 states, plus the U.S. Virgin Islands,
  classified as free of bovine tuberculosis and 24 states, plus
  Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which have eradicated
  brucellosis. Only 20 states and the U.S. Virgin islands have
  eradicated both diseases, it noted.
