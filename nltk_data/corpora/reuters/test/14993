MEAD &lt;MEA> EXPECTS IMPROVED EARNINGS THIS YEAR
  Mead Corp said the outlook for its
  major paper markets looks strong for the second quarter and
  augurs well for its earnings in 1987.
      "The generally strong outlook bodes well for significantly
  improved earnings this year," Burnell Roberts, chairman and
  chief executive officer said.
      Earlier, the company reported first quarter earnings of
  34.2 mln dlrs, or 1.09 dlrs a share, versus 20.3 mln dlrs, or
  65 cts a share, in last year's first quarter.
      In 1986 the company reported earnings from continuing
  operations of 109.3 mln dlrs, or 3.50 dlrs a share.
      Mead said its first quarter benefitted from stronger market
  conditions and improved operations.
      "The combination of capital improvement programs and more
  employee involvement has been paying off throughout our paper
  operations," Roberts said.
      He added that Mead's pulp and paperboard businesses are
  operating well as prices have improved and strong demand has
  placed most products in a sold-out position through the middle
  of the year.
      Mead said sales of its unbleached coated paperboard was
  particularly strong, up 13 pct versus the first quarter 1986.
