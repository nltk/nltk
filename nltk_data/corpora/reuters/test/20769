REAGAN SEES ROOM FOR INTEREST RATE DECLINES
  President Reagan said he was pleased
  with the actions of some banks to reduce their prime lending
  rates today and said he sees room for a further decline in
  interest rates.
      "I believe there is room in the market for a further decline
  in interest rates," Reagan said in a statement as he left the
  White House to visit his wife Nancy at Bethesda Naval Hospital.
      Reagan's statement followed a meeting with his top economic
  advisers.
      Reagan said he remains concerned about the market, but that
  actions taken by the Federal Reserve have helped.
      "Interest rates are down across the spectrum," Reagan said.
      "Specifically, I am pleased that the bond market is strong
  and that foreign exchange markets are stable," Reagan said.
