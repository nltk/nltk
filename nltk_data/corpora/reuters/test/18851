RIO DE JANEIRO DOCKERS STRIKE OVER WAGES
  Rio de Janeiro's 3,500
  dockworkers went on strike for an indefinite period today to
  demand wage increases, a spokesman for the dockers said.
      The Rio dockers did not get support from their colleagues
  in Santos, Brazil's main port, but the spokesman said they
  would not return to work unless their demands were met.
      Earlier this week, some 65,000 dockworkers cancelled a
  scheduled national strike to pressure port officials to give
  them a wage increase and other benefits.
      A Rio port spokesman said the halt would cause daily losses
  of about 100,000 U.S. dlrs.
