JAPAN DOES NOT INTEND TO EASE CREDIT - OFFICIALS
  The Bank of Japan does not intend to ease
  credit policy further, bank officials told Reuters.
      They were responding to rumours in the Japanese bond market
  that the central bank was planning to cut its 2.5 pct discount
  rate soon, possibly before Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone
  leaves for Washington on April 29.
      Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita will be in Osaka,
  western Japan on April 27 and 28 for the annual meeting of the
  Asian Development Bank, making a rate cut announcement early
  next week a virtual impossibility, they said. April 29 is a
  holiday here.
