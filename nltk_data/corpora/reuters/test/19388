CCC CREDIT GUARANTEES TO EL SALVADOR REALLOCATED
  The Commodity Credit Corporation
  (CCC) has reallocated 1.3 mln dlrs in credit guarantees
  originally granted to cover the sale of protein meals to El
  Salvador so it may buy rice, the U.S. Agriculture Department
  said.
      The action reduces the guarantee line authorized for sales
  of protein meals to 12.7 mln dlrs and creates a rice credit
  guarantee line of 1.3 mln dlrs, the department said.
      All sales under the credit guarantee lines must be
  registered and exports completed by September 30, the
  department said.
