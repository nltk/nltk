JAPAN UNEMPLOYMENT RISES TO RECORD 3.2 PCT IN MAY
  Japan's seasonally adjusted unemployment
  rate rose to a record 3.2 pct in May, the worst level since the
  government started compiling unemployment statistics in 1953,
  the government's Management and Coodination Agency said.
      The May rate surpassed the previous record of 3.0 pct
  marked set in January and April this year. It was also up
  sharply from 2.7 pct a year earlier.
      Unadjusted May unemployment totalled 1.91 mln people, up
  from 1.90 mln in April and 1.62 mln a year earlier.
      An agency official blamed industrial restructuring and the
  strong yen for the rise in unemployment.
      The seasonally adjusted male unemployment rate in May rose
  to a record 3.2 pct, surpassing the previous record 3.0 pct set
  in July 1986. This compares with 2.9 pct in April and 2.7 pct a
  year earlie. Unadjusted male unemployment totalled 1.12 mln, up
  180,000 from a year earlier.
      The female unemployment rate in May was unchanged from
  April at a record 3.1 pct. A year ago, the rate was 2.8 pct.
  Unadjusted female unemployment rose 100,000 to 790,000.
      The yen's appreciation continued to affect employment in
  manufacturing industries and the total employed in May fell
  210,000 or 1.5 pct from a year earlier to 14.10 mln.
