EXPORTS OTHER THAN COFFEE RISE SHARPLY IN COLOMBIA
  Colombian exports other than coffee rose
  55 pct in January compared with the same period last year,
  figures from the government statistics institute show.
      Non-coffee exports amounted to 180.8 mln dlrs fob compared
  with 147.5 mln dlrs for coffee, a drop of 42 pct from last
  year.
      The trade balance registered a 35 mln dlr surplus, compared
  with a 56 mln dlr surplus in January 1986.
      The national planning department forecast that in 1987
  coffee, Colombia's traditional major export, will account for
  only one third of total exports, or about 1.5 billion dlrs.
