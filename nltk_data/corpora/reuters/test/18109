DANISH RESERVES RISE 10.5 BILLION CROWNS IN MAY
  Denmark's net official reserves rose
  to 60.629 billion crowns in May from 48.380 billion in April,
  against 39.481 billion in May 1986, the Central Bank said in
  its monthly balance sheet report.
      Total net reserves, including reserves held by commercial
  and major savings banks and corrected for exchange rate
  adjustments, rose to 58.373 billion crowns in May from 47.835
  billion in April, against 32.443 billion in May 1986.
      The Bank said in a statement that public loan transactions
  accounted for net capital import of 0.1 billion crowns in May,
  with net registered private capital imports of 9.1 billion.
      "Of this, the net sale of Danish crown bonds to other
  countries totalled about 2.5 billion crowns. There was balance
  between the purchase and sale of foreign securities," the
  statement added.
      The Central Bank said that figures for private bank
  reserves and registered capital movements were provisional and
  there was no estimate yet of unregistered movements.
      "It is therefore not possible on this basis to draw
  conclusions about the developments of the external current
  account," the statement added.
