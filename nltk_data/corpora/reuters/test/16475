CANADA STOCKS/DOME PETROLEUM LTD &lt;DMP>
  Dome Petroleum Ltd shares moved higher
  in the U.S. and Canada after TransCanada PipeLines Ltd &lt;TRP>
  made a 4.3 billion Canadian dlr bid for Dome and Dome said it
  is in talks with two other unidentified companies.
      Market speculation is that the other two potential bidders
  are not Canadian companies and DuPont's &lt;DD> Conoco and
  Atlantic Richfield Co &lt;ARC> are mentioned as possibilities,
  Wilf Gobert of Peters and Co Ltd said.
      Dome rose 1/4 to 1-1/8 on the American Stock Exchange.
  TransCanada PipeLines was down 1/4 at 15-3/4 on the New York
  Stock Exchange.
      Dome was the most active stock on the Toronto exchange at
  1.50 dlrs per share, up 37 cts.
      Gobert characterized the market action in Dome as "awfully
  optimistic" but said investors are hoping for a competing offer
  to the shareholders.
      TransCanada PipeLines' offer is to Dome management, not to
  shareholders. However, it proposes issuing new equity in a
  subsidiary that would operate Dome assets. Current Dome
  shareholders would own 20 pct of the new subsidiary.
