TALKS CONTINUE ON TIN AGREEMENT EXTENSION
  Discussions on the possible extension of
  the sixth International Tin Agreement (ITA) began at the
  quarterly session of the International Tin Council (ITC) but
  the Council is still waiting for decisions from various member
  states.
      A number of producer governments in particular have not
  decided their final position on whether the ITA should be
  extended for up to two years or wound down after it expires on
  June 30, according to delegate sources.
      Earlier today European Community (EC) members decided to
  back an extension, with the exception of Britain, which
  undertook to communicate its decision to its EC partners later.
      Delegates said it could be Friday before all the member
  countries declare their positions on the possible extension.
  Today's full Council session started shortly before 1500 GMT
  after the scheduled 1330 start was delayed by an EC
  coordination meeting.
      The council reconvenes at 0930 GMT tomorrow, although
  delegates said the morning is likely to be taken up with minor
  technical matters and the main issue will probably not be
  discussed before the afternoon session.
