DUTCH ADJUSTED UNEMPLOYMENT RISES IN MARCH
  Dutch seasonally adjusted unemployment
  rose in the month to end-March to a total 693,000 from 690,600
  at end-February, but was well down from 730,100 at end-March
  1986, Social Affairs Ministry figures show.
      The figure for male jobless rose by 2,000 in the month to
  436,500 compared with 470,700 a year earlier. The figure for
  women was 256,500 at end-March against 256,100 a month earlier
  and 259,400 at end-March 1986.
      On an unadjusted basis total unemployment fell by 16,500 in
  the month to end-March to 692,200. In March 1986 the figure was
  725,000.
      A ministry spokesman said the unadjusted figures showed a
  smaller than usual seasonal decrease for the time of year,
  because of particularly cold weather delaying work in the
  building industry. He said this explained the increase in the
  adjusted statistics.
      Total vacancies available rose by 1,900 to 26,300 at
  end-March. A year earlier the figure was 28,763.
