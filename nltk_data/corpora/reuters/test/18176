SKYLINE &lt;SKX.V> EXPECTS TO BEGIN MINE IN JULY
  Skyline Explorations Ltd said expects
  construction can begin next month on a gold mine at Johnny
  Mountain Camp, located 600 miles north of Vancouver.
      The company said a contract has been let for a 200 to 400
  tons per day mill and the company is receiving cooperation from
  provincial and federal agencies on its stage one report,
  "approval in principal," which is required before actual
  construction can begin.
      Skyline said it is optimistic the approval in principal
  will be received in late June, by which time it expects to have
  confirmed threshold tonnage and grade targets so construction
  can begin in July.
     
      Skyline said the 1987 exploration drift on 16 vien east at
  Johnny Mountain has advanced 320 feet. The vein is continuous,
  averaging four feet thick plus an altered mineralized hanging
  wall.
      It said periodic face samples indicate an average grade of
  1.05 ounces per ton of ore ranging from a low of 0.78 ounce per
  ton to a high of 55.8 ounces per ton.
