JONES AND VINING &lt;JNSV.O> STARTS BID FOR SHARES
  Jones and Vining Inc said it has
  started a tender offer for all of its own shares at five dlrs
  per share. 
      The company said it will hold a special meeting on July 10
  for a vote on approval of a merger at the tender price.
      It said the price to be paid in the tender and merger could
  be reduced by any fees and expenses the court may award to
  counsel for the plaintiffs in the class action suit brought
  against it in Delaware Chancery Court by Ronda Inc. The
  plaintfiffs' counsel are seeking fees of up to 10 cts per
  share, Jones and Vining said.
      The company said the court has scheduled a hearing on the
  proposed settlement of the suit for July Eight.
      The company said the start of the tender offer and the
  calling of the special meeting are conditions of the
  settlement, and completion of the tender and merger are
  conditioned on final approval of the settlement.
