CANADA JANUARY LEADING INDICATOR UP 0.4 PCT
  Canada's leading composite indicator
  rose 0.4 pct in January with eight of the 10 major components
  posting gains, the most widespread monthly advance in the past
  year, Statistics Canada said.
      The index also gained 0.4 pct in the preceeding month. The
  unfiltered index, however, fell 0.1 pct in January after rising
  1.0 pct in December.
      The gain was led by the residential construction index
  while the manufacturing groups continued to improve and the
  stock market index turned up, the federal agency reported.
