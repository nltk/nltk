UNILEVER SEEKS BUYER FOR STAUFFER CHEMICAL
  Unilever Plc and NV &lt;UN.AS> has issued a
  prospectus through investment bankers Goldman Sachs and Co
  seeking a buyer for &lt;Stauffer Chemical Co> of the U.S., Which
  it acquired with the recent takeover of &lt;Chesebrough-Pond's
  Inc>, a Unilever spokesman said.
      He noted Unilever has been indicating plans to dispose of
  Stauffer, plus some smaller assets of Chesebrough, since the
  bid was made in December.
      The Stauffer sale prospectus has been sent in recent weeks
  to a number of companies expressing interest.
      The Unilever spokesman declined to say how much the group
  expected to receive for Stauffer.
      Chesebrough's footwear and tennis racket businesses are
  also likely to be disposed of, he added.
      Immediately available financial information on Stauffer,
  which is wholly-owned, was limited, he added. Nine month sales
  to September 1986 were about 1.2 billion dlrs.
      Unilever aquired Chesebrough for 3.2 billion dlrs in order
  to benefit from its well-known toiletry brands and food
  products.
