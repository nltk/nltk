FED GOVERNOR SEGER SEES CURRENCY STABILITY
  Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha
  Seger said there were signs of helpful stability in foreign
  exchange markets in recent weeks.
      "I think we are beginning to see more calm in those markets,"
  Seger told reporters after a speech to the U.S. League of
  Savings Institutions.
      "I think it is very healthy when you can get into a period
  of stability," she said.
      She said market forces have a major influence on exchange
  rates and said she did not know the right value for the dollar
  against the Yen or the Mark.
      Seger told the Savings and Loan executives that she was
  concerned about financial markets' absorption with exchange
  rate influences.
      "I am concerned that we have gotten so nervous," about
  exchange rates, Seger said.
      She said the Fed takes into account additional factors in
  determining monetary policy than the value of the dollar
  against other currencies.
      On the economy, Seger called the latest figures in gross
  national product a modest upward revision.
