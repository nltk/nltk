CCC INTEREST HIGHER IN JUNE, USDA SAYS
  Interest rates on commodity loans
  disbursed by the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) this month
  will carry a 6-7/8 pct interest rate, the U.S. Agriculture
  Department said.
      That is up from the May rate of 6-1/4 pct and reflects the
  interest rate charged the CCC by the U.S. Treasury in June,
  USDA noted.
