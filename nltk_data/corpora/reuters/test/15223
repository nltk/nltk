WHITE HOUSE SAYS JAPANESE TARRIFFS LIKELY
  The White House said high U.S.
  Tariffs on Japanese electronic goods would likely be imposed as
  scheduled on April 17, despite an all-out effort by Japan to
  avoid them.
      Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater made the remark one
  day before U.S. And Japanese officials are to meet under the
  emergency provisions of a July 1986 semiconductor pact to
  discuss trade and the punitive tariffs.
      Fitzwater said: "I would say Japan is applying the
  full-court press...They certainly are putting both feet forward
  in terms of explaining their position." But he added that "all
  indications are they (the tariffs) will take effect."
