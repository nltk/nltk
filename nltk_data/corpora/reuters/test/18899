EC INCREASES SPECIAL FEED WHEAT TENDERS - TRADE
  The European Community (EC) has increased
  the size of two special export tenders for British and West
  German feed wheat held in intervention stores and included
  South Korea as an acceptable destination, traders said.
      The tender was originally for 120,000 tonnes of British and
  120,000 tonnes of West German feed wheat for shipment only to
  Poland.
      But now both tranches have been increased by 50,000 tonnes
  to 170,000 tonnes with South Korea added as a possible
  destination. Both tenders are open from June 24.
