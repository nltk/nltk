U.S. TREASURY'S BAKER MEETS WEST GERMAN MINISTER
  U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker
  met West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and
  Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl today in West Germany and
  agreed to support the Louvre pact, the Treasury Department
  said.
      The Treasury described the meeting as "a very positive,
  private meeting in Frankfurt, West Germany which had been
  agreed upon last week. "The parties agreed to continue economic
  cooperation under the Louvre agreement and its flexible
  application including cooperation on exchange rate stability
  and monetary policies," the Treasury said.
      The Treasury said Baker and Stoltenberg "are consulting with
  their G-7 colleagues and are confident that this will enable
  them to foster exchange rate stability around current levels."
      The Louvre pact is an agreement between the Group of Seven
  leading industrial countries including the United States and
  West Germany to promote currency stability.
      Baker was scheduled to visit Scandinavia and Belgium this
  week and the department earlier refused to release details of
  his travel itinerary, citing security considerations.
