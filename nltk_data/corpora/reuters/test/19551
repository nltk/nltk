EC FARM MINISTERS TO MEET TOMORROW AFTER SUMMIT
  European Community agriculture
  ministers will meet tomorrow evening, after the end of a
  two-day summit meeting of heads of government, to again attempt
  to agree a 1987/88 farm price package, an EC Commission
  spokesman said.
      He added that tomorrow's EC Official Journal will contain
  notice of special agricultural measures of a purely technical
  nature which will come into effect on July 1 unless the
  ministers reach an accord.
      The spokesman declined to detail these special measures but
  said they would not be the sort of "dynamic" moves which EC Farm
  Commissioner Frans Andriessen has said he would take in the
  case of complete deadlock among farm ministers.
      These moves would be taken only if tomorrow's meeting of
  ministers in Brussels again fails to reach an accord, EC
  sources said.
      Andriessen is thought to be prepared to cut cereals prices
  by seven pct and to take other drastic action, trade sources
  said.
      EC farm ministers ended their last meeting on June 18 still
  split over the Commission's proposal for a tax on vegetable and
  marine oils and fats.
      In addition, West Germany said it would veto plans for
  cereal price cuts and for a change in the green currency
  system.
      Earlier today, diplomats said Belgium, the current holder
  of the European Community presidency, appears ready to drop the
  plans for the controversial oils and fats tax.
