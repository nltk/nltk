SPAIN HAS 35 MLN DLR CURRENT SURPLUS FEBRUARY
  Spain had a 35 mln dlr current account
  surplus in February compared with a 68 mln dlr surplus in
  January and a 355 mln dlr surplus in February last year, Bank
  of Spain figures show.
      Spain's trade deficit narrowed to 581 mln dlrs compared
  with 664 mln dlrs in January but the large increase in non-oil
  imports contributed to the substantial increase over the 159
  mln dlr deficit registered in February 1986.
      Exports at 2.58 billion dlrs were up 19 pct compared with
  February last year, but imports were 46 pct higher than last
  February, totalling 3.16 billion dlrs.
      Non-oil imports totalled 2.79 billion dlrs compared with
  1.91 billion in February last year, reflecting the large
  ammount of investment goods entering the country with the
  recovery of the Spanish economy, the Bank of Spain said.
      Spain's tourism earnings continued to grow and totalled 655
  mln dlrs in February, compared with 103 mln dlrs in January and
  502 mln dlrs in February last year.
