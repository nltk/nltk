BANGLADESH NAVY UNLOADS GRAINS DURING PORT STRIKE
  The navy is unloading
  foodgrains at Chittagong port following a strike by nearly
  1,000 dockworkers, Bangladesh Shipping Corp officials said.
      The navy was unloading 74,000 tonnes of foodgrains from two
  ships today, and four vessels laden with some 90,000 tonnes of
  grains were waiting at the outer anchorage, port officials
  said.
      A spokesman for the workers said they would continue their
  strike until authorities agree to their demands for higher pay
  and other benefits. The strike began on June 11.
      "Unloading of grains and other essential commodities started
  normally after we called in navy personnel to help," a port
  official told Reuters.
      "The strike has caused no serious dislocation," he said.
      The government meanwhile declared the port jobs an
  "essential service" and said the strikers could be dismissed
  unless they end the strike soon.
