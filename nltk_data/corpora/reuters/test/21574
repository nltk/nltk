JAPAN/INDIA CONFERENCE CUTS GULF WAR RISK CHARGES
  The Japan/India-Pakistan-Gulf/Japan
  shipping conference said it would cut the extra risk insurance
  surcharges on shipments to Iranian and Iraqi ports to a minimum
  three pct from 4.5 pct on October 25.
      It said surcharges on shipments of all break-bulk cargoes
  to non-Iraqi Arab ports would be reduced to 3.0 pct from 4.5.
      A conference spokesman declined to say why the move was
  taken at a time of heightened tension in the Gulf.
