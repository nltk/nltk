BRAZIL COTTON CROP LOWER -- USDA REPORT
  Brazil's 1986/87 cotton crop estimate
  has been reduced to 710,000 from 735,000 tonnes (lint basis),
  the U.S. Agriculture Department's officer in Sao Paulo said in
  a field report.
      The report, dated April 7, said the reduction is based on
  an expected smaller harvest in the center-south region.
      The center-south crop is now estimated at 550,000 tonnes --
  25,000 tonnes below the previous estimate.
      Hot, dry weather during part of January and excessive rains
  in some areas in February reduced yield prospects and may have
  affected quality, the report said.
      Nearly 60 pct of the crop has been harvested in Parana and
  slightly less in Sao Paulo, it said. Cotton entering gins is of
  fairly good quality, according to trade sources, it said.
