SPOT TIN EASIER ON EUROPEAN FREE MARKET
  Spot tin on the European free market was
  indicated in the easier range 4,200 to 4,230 stg per tonne, for
  high grade metal in warehouse Rotterdam, down 20 stg from
  yesterday's afternoon kerb close.
      Stability in sterling versus the dollar continued to apply
  pressure to a market which is coming close to testing a
  psychological chart support base at 4,200 stg, traders said.
      Dealers said major consumers still need to cover their May
  and June requirements but are holding out for even lower
  offers. Reported high grade tin business in London was confined
  to end April metal at 4,225 stg.
      Small-scale spot business was reported by West German
  operators at 12.60 and 12.63 marks per kilo although the market
  was still being undercut by Chinese material, which traded at
  one stage down to 12.54 marks per kilo, traders said.
