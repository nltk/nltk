FED EXPECTED TO SET CUSTOMER REPURCHASES
  The Federal Reserve is expected to add
  reserves to the U.S. banking system by arranging a round of
  customer repurchase agreements during this morning's
  intervention period, several economists said.
      Some others, however, judged that the Fed has almost
  completed its reserve-adding requirement for the statement
  period ending on Wednesday and will not need to operate today.
      Fed funds were trading at 6-11/16 pct, compared with
  Friday's average of 6.63 pct.
