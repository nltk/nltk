JUDGE TO DECIDE BURLINGTON &lt;BUR> IN SEVERAL DAYS
  U.S. District Court Judge Eugene
  A. Gordon said he will decide "in the next few days" whether to
  grant Burlington Industries Inc's request to stop a takeover by
  Samjens Acquisition Corp.
      "I do not know how I come down on this preliminary
  injunction," Gordon said after listening to arguments by
  attorneys for 1-1/2 days.
      "It's been a long time since I was deluged with as much
  information as I have been. I have to consider what's been
  presented and issue an opinion on this. Both sides cannot be
  winners," he said.
      Burlington requested the injunction to stop a takeover
  effort by Samjens, claiming the partnership used illegally
  obtained confidential information about the company to make its
  offer. It also alleges there would be anti-trust violations if
  Samjens, formed by Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of
  Canada, were to succeed.
      Samjens last week topped a 76 dlr per share offer for
  Burlington from Morgan Stanley Group &lt;MS> by one dlr per share.
  Morgan Stanley made its 2.44 billion dlr bid after Samjens bid
  72 dlrs per share for Burlington.
      Burlington lawyers told the court if the injunction is not
  granted Samjens would win control of Burlington. A Samjens
  lawyer argued that if the judge granted the injunction it would
  "kill the offer"
      Jay Greenfield, an attorney for Samjens, said the
  partnership would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction
  were granted. "There's only one Burlington," he said. "If we
  cannot get that then no amount of money can compensate us."
      Greenfield also said Samjens could sell its holdings in
  Burlington for 95 mln dlrs. "We don't want that. We're not in
  this for the money," he said.
      Irving Nathan, a Burlington lawyer, reiterated that
  information provided by James Ammeen, a former Burlington
  executive, was crucial to Dominion's decision to attempt o
  takeover of Burlington.
      "Dominion relied on the information provided by the insider
  Jim Ammeen," Nathan said.
      An attorney for Ammeen, who is named as a defendant, asked
  the court to dismiss the lawsuit against his client. The judge
  said he would not rule on the request today.
