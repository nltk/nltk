MINNTECH &lt;MNTX> SEES FIRST QUARTER LOSS
  Minntech Corp said it expects
  to report loss for its fiscal 1988 first quarter to end June
  30, due to start-up costs related to a new membrane oxygenator
  and water filtration products.
      However, revenues and earnings should consistently increase
  throughout the remainder of the year, President Louis Cosentino
  told analysts.
