MEXICO HAS NO PLANS TO LEAVE ICO
  Mexico has no intention of leaving
  the International Coffee Organization (ICO), in the event of
  Brazil withdrawing from the group, the Mexican Coffee Institute
  (IMC) said.
      The IMC said in a statement the ICO is an important
  instrument for ensuring producers obtain an adequate price.
  Mexico currently produces around five mln 60-kilo bags of
  coffee per year.
      Brazil said during a meeting of coffee producers in Rio de
  Janeiro over the weekend that it would consider leaving the ICO
  if its export quota was reduced by the organization.
