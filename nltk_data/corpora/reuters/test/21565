NEW ZEALAND IMPOSES SANCTIONS AGAINST FIJI
  New Zealand has imposed sanctions
  against Fiji in response to that country's change of status to
  a republic, acting prime minister Geoffrey Palmer said.
      The sanctions will end all military cooperation and cut
  economic aid. New Zealand will also not renew an agreement
  which supports the price of Fijian sugar when it expires in
  March. The loss of aid and sugar supports will cost Fiji about
  10 mln dlrs a year.
      Palmer told reporters after a cabinet meeting that the
  government had asked High Commissioner Rod Gates to return from
  Suva for discussions about other possible measures.
      "We won't be reacting further until these discussions with
  the High Commissioner and the Prime Minister have been held,"
  Palmer said.
      The sanctions were approved by the cabinet soon after
  Colonel Sitivene Rabuka staged his second coup on September 25.
  Implementation was postponed in the hope that Rabuka might turn
  back from declaring a republic.
      Palmer said the cabinet was happy with the statement from
  Commonwealth leaders in Vancouver that Fiji's membership of the
  Commonwealth had lapsed. Prime Minister David Lange is in
  Hawaii on his way home from Vancouver.
