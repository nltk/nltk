CONVOY RUNS GULF GAUNTLET, OTHER SHIPS STAY CLEAR
  A new convoy of tankers escorted by
  American warships headed down the Gulf on Wednesday, towards
  Iranian oil platforms still oozing smoke after having being
  blasted by U.S. Navy raiders.
      Some Gulf sea captains were reported to be steering well
  clear of Iran's Silkworm missiles, however, and frontline
  emirate Kuwait redeployed air defences to counter the threat.
      "I think the predominant feeling ... Is of being scared this
  conflict will escalate," a top West German Foreign Ministry
  official, Helmut Schaefer, told reporters in Bahrain after a
  tour of three Gulf states.

      Shipping sources said on Tuesday night at least six sea
  captains had voiced fears that Iran would avenge Monday's U.S.
  Raids by unleashing more Silkworm missiles at ships plying the
  Gulf.
      Belgium decided two minesweepers en route for the Gulf
  would stay out for the time being following Monday's U.S.
  Action.
      But there was no sign that the prospect of more tit-for-tat
  assaults had reduced the level of shipping activity in the
  area.
      Iran, having vowed to react strongly after Monday's U.S.
  Action, launched a barrage of threats and ridicule.
      For its part, Washington warned Iran again on Tuesday that
  it was ready for any further hostile action.
      Pentagon officials then announced that a U.S. Guided
  missile destroyer began escorting two Kuwaiti tankers flying
  the U.S. flag southwards--the 80,000 tonne product carrier
  Ocean City and 46,000 tonne petroleum tanker Gas King.
