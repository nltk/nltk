BRAZIL'S SARNEY RENEWS CALL FOR WAR ON INFLATION
  President Jose Sarney today declared "a
  war without quarter" on inflation and said the government would
  watch every cent of public expenditure.
      Sarney, addressing his cabinet live on television, also
  reiterated that he intended to remain in power for five years,
  until 1990. There has been a long-running political debate
  about how long his mandate should be.
      Brazil is currently suffering from the worst inflation of
  its history. In April monthly inflation reached 21 pct.
