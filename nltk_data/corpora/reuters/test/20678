SENATOR URGES ACTION TO STABILIZE STOCK MARKETS
  Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa, urged the
  Administration to take steps to reduce volatility in the
  financial markets, including suspending program trading and
  limiting daily trading on stock index futures.
      Heinz said margin requirements for index futures, now six
  pct, should be the same as for common stock and equities.
      He urged creation of a task force to be headed by former
  Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker to coordinate
  international credit and montary policies among major nations
  and stabilize interest rates at the lowest possible levels.
