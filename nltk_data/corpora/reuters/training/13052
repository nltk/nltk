MINAS DE ALMADEN RAISES MERCURY PRICE
  Spain's Minas de Almaden y Arrayanes S.A.
  has agreed with Algerian producer ENOF to establish a minimum
  price of 300 dlrs per flask for spot mercury sales, Almaden
  spokesman Jesus Gallego said.
      In response to enquiries from Reuters, he said his company
  had raised the minimum price for its spot sales from 240 dlrs
  per flask following talks with ENOF.
      In a separate press release, the company said that ENOF and
  Almaden held talks in Istanbul a week ago with Turkish mercury
  producers on ways to improve prices, but Gallego said he was
  not in a position to say what action the Turkish companies
  would be taking.
