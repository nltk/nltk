ISRAEL'S FIVE-YEAR PLAN TO BOOST AGRICULTURE
  Israel has drawn up a five-year plan
  for 1987-1991 to raise agricultural production by 500 mln dlrs
  to 2.7 billion dlrs, an annual rise of 3.4 pct, the Israeli
  Ministry of Agriculture said. Agricultural exports are to be
  increased by 180 mln dlrs, or 4.8 pct per year on average.
      The area planted to cotton is to remain at the 1986 level
  of 100,000 to 112,500 acres with exports expected to bring in
  80 to 90 mln dlrs per year. The 34 pct decline from the 1985
  level reflects continued water rationing which will remain in
  force, the ministry said.
      Groundnut production is planned to increase by 13,000
  tonnes, or 57 pct, by 1991 and exports by 9,000 tonnes, or 82
  pct. Maize production is targetted to rise by 48,000 tonnes, or
  48 pct, and exports by 34,000 tonnes, or 45 pct.
