FED MAY ADD RESERVES, ECONOMISTS SAY
  The Federal Reserve may intervene in
  the government securities market to add reserves today, some
  economists said, although others felt that the Fed was likely
  to refrain from any action.
      Those who believed the Fed will intervene said it would
  probably add temporary reserves indirectly via 1.5 to two
  billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements.
      But others noted the Fed's current add-need is not large.
  They also expected the federal funds rate to edge lower.
      Fed funds, which averaged 6.21 pct on Monday, opened at
  6-1/8 pct and remained at that level in early trading.
