JAPAN'S LIPC TO BUY BEEF ON APRIL 23
  Japan's Livestock Industry Promotion Corp
  (LIPC) said that on April 28 it will import 7,515 tonnes of
  beef for the first half of the 1987 fiscal year started on
  April 1 under the simultaneous buy and sell tender system,
  against 6,813 a year ago.
      The system calls on the agency to buy beef from trading
  houses and simultaneously sell it to users in one tender. The
  tender quota in April-September is 10 pct of the agency's beef
  import share. Japan's beef import quota in 1987/88 was set at
  93,000 tonnes against 85,000 for the same period in 1986/87.
