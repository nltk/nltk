PEPSICO &lt;PEP> UPGRADED BY KIDDER PEABODY
  Kidder Peabody and Co analyst Roy Burry
  issued a strong buy recommendation on Pepsico Inc, citing an
  improved profit outlook for both domestic soft drinks and
  Frito-Lay snack foods.
      Pepsico climbed 7/8 to 34-3/4 on 615,000 shares by
  midmorning.
      Burry forecast earnings of 2.00 dlrs per share in 1987 and
  2.30 dlrs in 1988. In 1986 the company earned 1.75 dlrs per
  share. Burry previously had a sell recommendation on Pepsico.
  "We're looking at 10 to 15 pct earnings growth for Frito-lay in
  1987, a trend that should continue through the decade."
