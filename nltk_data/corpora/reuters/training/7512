INTERNATIONAL SUGAR PACT TO BE RENEGOTIATED
  The International Sugar Agreement (ISA)
  will be renegotiated, International Sugar Organization (ISO)
  officer in charge Constantin Politoff told Reuters after a
  special session of the pact's council.
      A decision on how to renegotiate will be taken at the ISO
  six monthly session in May. The alternatives are between an
  autumn London conference for another pact without economic
  clauses, but a different voting and budgetary structure, or a
  Geneva-based conference next year for a new pact with economic
  clauses, he said.
      But delegates said the latter would only be considered if
  the world's four major exporters -- Australia, Brazil, Cuba and
  the European Community -- can resolve differences over how
  prices can best be supported and how to share the world
      Today's special session was called because the U.S. earlier
  indicated it would only be able to pay 56 pct of its share of
  the ISO budget.
      At today's council session Politoff said the U.S. would try
  and find a way to pay the balance of about 50,000 stg later
  this year. Currently, about three quarters of this year's ISO
  800,000 stg budget has not been paid but delegates said the
  U.S. caused controversy as it said it might not pay its full
  contribution in the last year of the current pact.
      The Soviet Union has called for changes to the way the ISO
  budget is shared out. Currently it is halved between importers
  and exporters and the Soviet Union has a 30 pct share of the
  importer half. The Soviets want a new sugar pact to have only a
  single category of members who would all share the costs pro
  rata to their share of world sugar trade.
      The ISO executive committee next meets on April 23 with the
  next full council session in the week of May 19.
      There are 12 importing and 44 exporting members of the ISO.
