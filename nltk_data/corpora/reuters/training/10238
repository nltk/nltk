CTC DEALER TO APPEAL CANADIAN TIRE DECISION
  CTC Dealer Holdings Ltd said it would
  appeal a previously reported Ontario court ruling upholding an
  Ontario Securities Commission decision to block CTC's bid for
  49 pct of &lt;Canadian Tire Corp Ltd> common shares.
      CTC, a group of Canadian Tire dealers, added that it also
  extended its tender offer to March 31 and was seeking approval
  to extend its bid while the appeal court heard the case.
      It said Alfred and David Billes, two of Canadian Tire's
  controlling shareholders, backed the appeal and would seek
  leave to appeal while third controlling shareholder Martha
  Billes supported the appeal but would not join an appeal
  motion.
