U.S. WHEAT GROWERS WANT EEP TO SOVIET UNION
  The U.S. National Association of
  Wheat Growers (NAWG) urged the Reagan administration offer the
  Soviet Union wheat under the export enhancement program (eep).
      In a letter to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, NAWG
  stated its "strong support" for an eep offer to Moscow.
      "We believe that a solid case continues to exist for Soviet
  EEP eligibility, and the recently announced and reported Soviet
  purchases of U.S. corn indicate a Soviet willingness to
  purchase U.S. grain if it is competitively priced," NAWG said.
      "Consequently, we believe it is important to renew the U.S.
  eep offer and do all that is reasonably possible to ensure
  mutual adherence to the terms of the U.S.-Soviet grain
  agreement," the letter said.
