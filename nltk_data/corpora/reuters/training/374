PAKISTAN COTTON OUTPUT REACHES 7.7 MLN BALES
  Pakistan cotton production during the
  current crop season (Sept/March) reached 7.7 mln bales of 375
  pounds each, up 500,000 from last season, Shafi Niaz, Chairman
  of the Agricultural Prices Commission, said.
      Official sources said Pakistan was likely to use 3.4 mln
  bales of cotton during the current financial year ending June
  after 2.96 mln in 1985/86 and 2.70 mln in 1984/85.
      They said consumption would increase due to a rise in
  demand for cotton yarn in domestic markets and abroad. Pakistan
  produced 540 mln kilos of yarn in fiscal year 1985/86 and
  exported 157 mln.
      The State-owned cotton export corporation was likely to
  export 3.8 mln bales of cotton during the current fiscal year
  compared with 3.86 mln last year, cotton traders said.
      The traders said there would be 1.3 mln bales of cotton
  carryover this fiscal year compared with just over a mln bales
  last year.
