CHINESE INDUSTRIAL GROWTH RATE UP AFTER WEAK 1986
  The value of China's industrial output in
  January and February this year was 14.1 pct higher than in the
  same 1986 period, the New China News Agency said.
      Output increased by 5.6 pct from January 1985 to January
  1986 and 0.9 pct from February 1985 to 1986.
      The agency said the most recent increase was largely due to
  last year's poor performance. "No significant improvement was
  made in economic results," it said, adding that some successes
  were reported in readjusting the industrial product mix in the
  last quarter of 1986.
      The agency said the amount of tied up working capital rose
  and sizeable funds were occupied by unsaleable goods in 1986.
      It quoted unnamed economists as saying they expect 1987
  industrial production to increase at a proper rate and with
  better results, due to a cost-efficiency drive underway
  throughout the country. It gave no more details.
      The official industrial growth target this year is seven
  pct, down from an actual 9.2 pct last year.
