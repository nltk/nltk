DOT DISMISSES TWA &lt;TWA>, USAIR &lt;U> APPLICATION
  The U.S. Department of Transportation
  (DOT) said it dismissed on technical grounds an application by
  Trans World Airlines Inc for DOT approval for it to take
  control of USAir Group.
      The DOT added, however, that TWA was free to refile when it
  could put together an application for control that met the
  agency's procedural requirements.
      The DOT acted shortly after the U.S. Department of Justice
  disclosed that it supported dismissal of the TWA application.
      It was not immediately clear what impact the denial would
  have on TWA's bid to take over USAir.
      In its control application, TWA had acknowledged that
  additional documentation was required to meet DOT rules and
  said it would file more material on the morning of March 9.
      But the DOT said it would not wait.
      "We have determined to dismiss TWA's application for
  approval of the acquisition of USAir," it said in an order
  issued late Friday.
      "TWA's application clearly fails to comply with the filing
  requirements of our regulations...and TWA has provided no
  reason why we should accept such a deficient filing," it added.
      "Accordingly, we will dismiss the application. TWA, of
  course, may refile it when it is able to comply with our
  procedural rules," the DOT said.
      The agency added that it would continue to consider a
  separate TWA request for federal clearance to purchase USAir
  stock through a voting trust.
      USAir had said earlier today that it asked the DOT to
  dismiss the TWA control application, on grounds the TWA filing
  did not meet DOT requirements.
