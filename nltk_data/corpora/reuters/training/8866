FLOWERS INDUSTRIES &lt;FLO> SEES LOWER YEAR NET
  Flowers Industries Inc said it
  expects lower earnings for the current year due to operating
  losses incurred by recent acquisitions and possible
  nonrecurring losses resulting from its restructuring efforts.
      For the year ended June 28, Flowers earned 29.5 mln dlrs.
  Today it reported nine month earnings of 14.9 mln dlrs, down
  from 15.9 mln dlrs a year before.
      Flowers said it expects fiscal 1988, however, to show the
  best growth in profits in its history due to the growing
  profitability of ongoing businesses, cost control efforts,
  higher productvitiy and lower taxes.
      Flowers said losses suffered in its West Texas operations
  and in five plants acquired at the start of the third quarter
  from &lt;CFS Staley Continental> and &lt;Wolf Baking Co> severely
  hurt results.
      It said the CFS and Wolf plants are expected to be
  contributing to profit by the end of the fiscal year and it is
  seeking to bring the West Texas operations to acceptable levels
  of profitability by the end of the fourth quarter as well.
