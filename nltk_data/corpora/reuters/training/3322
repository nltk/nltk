CAROLIN MINES HAS NEW GOLD ASSAY RESULTS
  Carolin Mines Ltd
  said recent assays of tailings at its Hope, British Columbia
  mine ranged from 0.50 to 0.64 ounces of gold per ton. 
      There were only trace amounts of platinum and palladium,
  the company said.
      Carolin said the results sharply disagreed with an earlier
  assay performed by Intergold U.S.A. Inc which showed 1.0 ounce
  of gold per ton and 0.50 ounce of platinum per ton.
      Carolin also said it expects to receive results of further
  tests and assays of the tailings within two to three weeks.
