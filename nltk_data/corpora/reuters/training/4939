USSR HEAVY BUYERS OF YUGOSLAV CORN-U.S. REPORT
  The Soviet Union has been a heavy
  buyer of Yugoslav corn since October, purchasing close to 1.5
  mln tonnes in the 1986/87 marketing year, according to a report
  from the U.S. agriculture counselor in Belgrade.
      Approximately 1.5 mln tonnes of Yugoslav corn have already
  been committed to foreign buyers for 1986/87, with most of this
  sold to the Soviet Union, the Yugoslav Grain Association
  reported to the U.S. official.
      In a report dated March 10, the official said that about
  800,000 tonnes of the corn has been delivered, with the balance
  of 700,000 tonnes to be shipped between now and June.
      An additional 500,000 tonnes of corn can be shipped from
  July-September, the grain associaiton said, so total Yugoslav
  corn exports could reach 2.0 mln tonnes, the counselor said.
      Heavier than normal monthly shipping rates for Yugoslav
  corn exports are due to the increased use of river barges for
  exporting corn to the Soviet Union, the counselor said.
      Monthly corn shipments out of Yugoslavia have averaged
  around 160,000 tonnes since October 1, higher than earlier
  estimates of 150,000, the official said.
      The Soviet Union has taken an increased share of Yugoslav
  corn sales during this marketing year, he said.
