EC TO MULL NEW DURUM WHEAT INTERVENTION RULES
  The European Commission is to consider
  proposed new higher minimum standards for sales of durum wheat
  into intervention stores, European Community sources said.
      They said a document drawn up by Commission officials
  proposes a reduction in the maximum humidity level to 13 pct
  from 14, an increase in the minimum weight to 78 kilos per
  hectolitre from 76, a tightening of other technical standards
  and introduction of some new ones.
      Current public stocks of durum wheat in the EC are 1.15 mln
  tonnes, of which almost 1.12 mln are in Italy.
