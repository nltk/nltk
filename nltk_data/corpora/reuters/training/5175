NO TAIWAN SUGAR EXPORTS EXPECTED THIS YEAR
  Taiwan is not expected to export sugar
  this year because of falling production and growing domestic
  consumption, state-owned Taiwan Sugar Corp said.
      A company spokesman told Reuters this will be the first
  time in more than 40 years Taiwan has not exported sugar. Last
  year, sugar exports totalled 149,755 tonnes.
      He said the actual production during the 1986/87 season
  (November/May) is about 480,000 tonnes, barely enough to meet
  local consumption. This compares with actual 1985/86 output of
  570,000. He said the production fall was due to typhoon damage
  to more than 6,000 hectares of canefields last year.
