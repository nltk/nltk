BELGIAN MINISTER SEES NEW ACCORD ON EC OILS/FATS
  Belgian Foreign Trade Minister Herman
  De Croo said he believed there would be a compromise within the
  European Community, EC, on its proposed tax on vegetable fats
  and oil, averting a pledged tough trade response by the United
  States.
      De Croo, in Washington for talks with Administration
  officials and Congressional leaders, said at a news conference
  there is a battle within the community on the tax on fats and
  oils used in the 12 EC countries.
      But he added, "I do not think it will be a big issue because
  there will be a big debate inside Europe," adding "so there will
  be a compromise."
      U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said yesterday
  that if the community went ahead with the tax, the United
  States would respond "vigorously" to protect its trade rights and
  access to community markets.
      De Croo also said he thought the community would postpone
  its April 28 deadline for imposing new slaughterhouse rules to
  cover all meats brought into EC nations if some progress was
  made toward resolving differences with the United States.
      U.S. officials say its rules now meet health standards and
  the EC should require equivalent but not identical standards.
      He also told reporters he hoped the community could deal
  with another controversial health proposal that would forbid
  the feeding of hormones to cattle, which is also opposed by the
  United States.
      De Croo gave no deals on how he though the issue might be
  resolved. That rule is go into effect on January 1, 1988.
      He said U.S. cattlemen say there is no reason to change
  slaughterhouse practices in April if the meat is to be banned a
  few months later by the hormone rule.
