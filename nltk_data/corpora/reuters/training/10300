INDIA'S 1986/87 CASTOR OIL EXPORTS FALL - TRADERS
  India's castor oil exports are
  provisionally estimated at 30,000 tonnes in fiscal 1986/87,
  ending March 31, against 54,000 tonnes in 1985/86 due to a
  shortfall in the domestic castorseed crop, private traders
  said.
      Drought in parts of the country is expected to reduce the
  castorseed crop to a provisionally estimated 350,000 tonnes in
  1986/87 from 550,000 tonnes in 1985/86, they told Reuters.
