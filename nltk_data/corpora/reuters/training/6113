OSHMAN'S &lt;OSHM> CITES WEAK REGIONAL ECONOMIES
  Oshman's Sporting Goods Inc said
  earnings for the fourth quarter ended January 31 were affected
  by the weak economies of Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana,
  resulting in a drop in net earnings to 5,415,000 dlrs or 92 cts
  a share from 7,730,000 dlrs or 1.28 dlrs a share for the
  year-ago quarter.
      The company also said sales on the West Coast were hurt by
  late snows and poor skiing conditions.
      Same-store sales declined 3.2 pct for the quarter and 2.2
  pct for the year.
      For the full year, Oshman's net earnings fell to 2,664,000
  dlrs or 45 cts a share, from 8,536,000 dlrs or 1.40 dlrs a
  share.
      In 1986, the company said it opened nine stores and closed
  three.
      At year-end, the company said it was operating 188 Oshman's
  stores and 27 Abercrombie and Fitch stores.
