COCONUT OIL CONTRACT TO CHANGE - DUTCH TRADERS
  Contract terms for trade in coconut
  oil are to be changed from long tons to tonnes with effect from
  the Aug/Sep contract onwards, Dutch vegetable oil traders said.
      Operators have already started to take account of the
  expected change and reported at least one trade in tonnes for
  Aug/Sept shipment yesterday.
      The Federation of Oils Seeds and Fats Associations, FOSFA,
  in London said it had previously advised traders to adopt the
  metric system for coconut oil transactions to bring the
  commodity into line with other vegetable oils.
