WHITE HOUSE SAYS INTEREST RATES REFLECT MARKET
  The White House said the rise in
  interest rates was "unfortunate in a general sense" but reflected
  market forces.
      "There's always movement up and down and the basic fact is
  that we believe the economy is strong and growing and there
  will always be fluctuations in the interest rate, but the
  economy is sound and in good shape," spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
  said.
      Citibank raised its prime rate by one quarter of a point
  and the move was followed by other banks.
