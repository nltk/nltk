U.S. SENATE HITS EC OILS TAX, VOWS RETALIATION
  The Senate voted to condemn the
  proposed European common market tax on vegetable and fish fats
  and oils and said it would result in retaliation.
      The non binding Senate resolution, a sense of Senate
  sentiment, was approved on a 99 to 0 vote.
      "The administration should communciate to the European
  Community the message that the United States will view the
  establishment of such a tax as inconsistent with the European
  Community's obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs
  and Trade that will result in the adoption of strong and
  immediate countermeasures," the resolution stated.
