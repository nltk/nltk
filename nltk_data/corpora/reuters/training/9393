THAI SUGAR PRODUCTION CONTINUES HIGH IN FEB
  Thai sugar production continued at a
  high level in February, latest figures received by the
  International Sugar Organization (ISO) show.
      The figures show stocks at end-February of 2.49 mln tonnes
  raw value against 2.33 mln a year earlier. Analysts said this
  was a new peak for the date.
      Production in February was 961,000 tonnes against 888,000
  in February 1986 and took the Nov/Feb total for the current
  crop to 2.25 mln tonnes. Production normally tails off sharply
  after March, but in recent years production from March to the
  end of the crop has been over 500,000 tonnes, analysts said.
      Thailand's exports in February were 32,800 tonnes and
  consumption 57,800.
      Last month the Thai Agriculture Ministry said 1986/87
  production was expected to fall to 2.3 mln tonnes from 2.48 mln
  in 1985/86.
