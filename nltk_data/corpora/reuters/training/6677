NEGOTIATORS PUT FINAL TOUCHES TO NEW RUBBER PACT
  Rubber producing and consuming
  countries, which agreed on the bases of a new International
  Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) last weekend, are now putting
  the final touches to the future accord, delegates said.
      They said discussions are focusing on conditions for entry
  into force of the new INRA. The present pact, which expires in
  October, required that governments accounting for 80 pct of
  world exports and 80 pct of world imports approved or ratified
  the pact before it became operational.
      Delegates said figures now being floated range between 65
  and 80 pct.
