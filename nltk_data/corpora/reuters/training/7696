USACAFES &lt;USF> SETS HIGHER DIVIDEND
  USACafes LP said its board declared a
  quarterly dividend of 20 cts per unit -- its first since
  converting to a limited partnership.
      The company, as USACafes Inc, had paid a quarterly dividend
  of nine cts per share.
      It said the restructuring as a partnership has
  substantially increased the cash available for distribution to
  unitholders, as it had predicted.
