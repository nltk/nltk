UNION VOTES TO STRIKE DAKOTA CITY IBP PLANT
  Members of the United Food and
  Commercial Workers union, UFCW, local 222 voted Sunday to go on
  strike against Iowa Beef Processors Inc Dakota City, Nebraska,
  plant, effective Tuesday.
      The company submitted their latest offer to the union at
  the same time announcing that they would end the lockout as of
  tomorrow that started December 14.
      Members unanimously rejected the latest company offer that
  was submitted to the union late last week. An overwhelming
  majority of the approximately 2,500 members attending the
  meeting then voted to go on strike, UFCW union spokesman Allen
  Zack said.
      Zack said the company's offer for a cut in wages was
  unacceptable and said IBP was refusing to bargain in good
  faith.
      IBP's latest offer included wage cuts of 60 cents an hour
  for slaughter operations and a 45 cents an hour cut in pay for
  processing workers. The cut follows the 1.07 dlr cut in pay
  workers received in 1982 and the wage freeze that has lasted
  since then, Zack said.
      The offer also eliminated overtime after eight hours
  following the normal 40 hour work week, he added.
