FED NOT EXPECTED TO ACT IN MONEY MARKETS
  The Federal Reserve is unlikely to
  operate in the U.S. government securities market during its
  usual intervention period this morning, economists said.
      Fed funds opened comfortably at 5-15/16 pct and remained at
  that level. Yesterday Fed funds averaged 5.99 pct.
