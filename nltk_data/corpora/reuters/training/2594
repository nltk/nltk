U.K. OFFICIALS STUDY SALMONELLA/CALF FEED LINK
  U.K. Officials are studying the possible
  link between the use of antibiotics in calf feeds and the
  spread of drug-resistant strains of salmonella in humans, a
  Ministry of Agriculture official said.
      A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine
  yesterday stated that the spread of an unusual strain of
  salmonella that is resistant to the drug chloramphenicol had
  been shown to be linked to farms that used the drug to promote
  the growth of cattle.
     The U.K. Ministry of Agriculture is working with the
  Department of Health and the Public Health Laboratory to
  investigate the whole subject of resistant strains of
  salmonella.
      "The Ministry of Agriculture is concerned about the possible
  effects on human and animal health," the official said. The
  government is also studying a recommendation from the Farm
  Animal Welfare Council (FAWC) to restrict the trade of calves
  under 56 days old through markets. The FAWC says this would
  help reduce the spread of salmonella.
