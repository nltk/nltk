FRENCH SUBSIDIZED CORN FOR TUNISIA/MOROCCO-USDA
  U.S. corn sales to Tunisia, Morocco
  and other North African countries may face increased
  competition from European Community (EC) corn sales, the U.S.
  Agriculture Department said.
      In its World Production and Trade report, the USDA said
  sales of French corn for nearby delivery have been confirmed
  with an export subsidy of about 145 dlrs per tonne, bringing
  the French price to about 72 dlrs per tonne, FOB.
      While this is about the same price as U.S. corn, EC corn
  has lower transport costs, the department noted.
      The French sales mark the beginning of commercial EC corn
  exports which could reach 750,000 tonnes to North Africa and
  the Middle East, areas which have traditionally purchased their
  corn needs from the United States, the department said.
      Department officials said the 750,000 tonnes of exports are
  for the year up to September 30 1987.
      They said export licenses for about 500,000 tonnes have
  been issued so far.
