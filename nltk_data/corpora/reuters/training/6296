CONGRESSMAN URGES WHEAT EEP TO SOVIET UNION
  Kansas Republican Congressman Pat
  Roberts urged the Reagan administration to offer export
  enhancement program, eep, subsidies to the Soviet Union.
      Speaking at a House foreign agriculture subcommittee,
  Roberts said the U.S. has offered eep to China and Poland, and
  should also include the Soviet Union.
      Rep. Roberts said there had been some talk that the issue
  of an eep to Moscow had not been raised within the Reagan
  administration recently because Secretary of State George
  Shultz was out of the country.
      "That very well may be the case," said Tom Kay, U.S.
  Agriculture Department Foreign Agricultural Service
  administrator. However, Kay told Reuters later that his reply
  to Roberts was not based on any particular knowledge.
      Rep. Roberts urged Kay to convey to top officials of the
  USDA that some in Congress favor a wheat eep to Moscow.
      "I'd be delighted to deliver the message," Kay replied.
      Earlier, Kay had repeated Agriculture Secretary Richard
  Lyng's statement last week that "the door is not yet closed on
  an eep to the Soviet Union."
