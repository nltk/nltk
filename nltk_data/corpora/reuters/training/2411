GIANT BAY &lt;GBYLF> DETAILS GORDON LAKE DEPOSIT
  Giant Bay Resources
  Ltd said a metallurgical study of its Gordon Lake gold deposit
  indicated an overall recovery of 95 pct to 96 pct of the gold
  can be achieved by either direct cyanidation of ore or
  flotation followed by cyanidation of concentrate.
      Continuation of an underground program on the property will
  begin in June, extending an existing drift along the
  200-foot-level where the main ore zone was encountered, Giant
  Bay said.
      The company did not elaborate on production figures for the
  property.
