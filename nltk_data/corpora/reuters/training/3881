CFTC APPROVES MGE CORN SYRUP FUTURES CONTRACT
  The Commodity Futures Trading
  Commission has approved the Minneapolis Grain Exchange's
  application to trade high fructose corn syrup-55, HFCS-55,
  futures contracts, the commission said.
      The contract provides for the delivery of 48,000 lbs, plus
  or minus two pct, of bulk HFCS-55 meeting specified standards
  regarding its physical and chemical properties.
      CFTC said the exchange plans to begin trading a July 1987
  HFCS-55 contract on April 6.
      CFTC said the soft drink industry currently buys at least
  95 pct of all U.S.-produced HFCS-55, a liquid food and beverage
  sweetener produced through the processing of corn starch by
  corn refiners.
