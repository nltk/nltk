AGREEMENT REACHED IN GREEK ALUMINA DEAL WITH MOSCOW
  Greece and the Soviet Union have reached
  agreement in Moscow on a joint venture for a 450 mln dlr
  alumina plant in Greece, government spokesman Yannis Roubatis
  said.
      Roubatis told reporters the Soviet Union agreed to buy the
  plant's entire annual output of 600,000 tonnes of alumina. More
  details would be given later by Greek Industry Undersecretary
  George Petsos, who was in Moscow.
      The project was due to start in 1986, but problems over
  plans to sell some alumina to Bulgaria caused delays. The
  Soviet Union, which was to take 400,000 tonnes, later agreed to
  take the full production.
