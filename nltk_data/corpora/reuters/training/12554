NEW DUTCH SPECIAL ADVANCES UNCHANGED AT 5.3 PCT
  The Dutch central bank announced new
  12-day special advances at an unchanged rate of 5.3 pct to
  cover money market tightness for the period April 3 to 15.
       The amount will be set at tender on April 3 between 0700
  and 0730 hours GMT.
      The new facility replaces the current 4.2 billion guilders
  of nine-day advances which expire tomorrow.
      Money market dealers said the rate for the new advances was
  in line with expectations. They added they expect the Bank to
  allocate between 4.0 and 4.5 billion guilders.
