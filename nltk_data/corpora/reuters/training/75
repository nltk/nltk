ICO EXPORTERS TO MODIFY NEW PROPOSAL
  International Coffee Organization (ICO)
  exporters will modify their new proposal on quota resumption
  before presenting it to importers tomorrow, ICO delegates said.
      The change, which will be discussed tonight informally
  among producers, follows talks after the formal producer
  session with the eight-member producer splinter group and will
  affect the proposed quota distribution for 12 months from April
  one, they said.
      The proposed share-out would still include shortfall
  declarations, they said.
