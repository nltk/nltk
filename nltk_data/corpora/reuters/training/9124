JAPAN'S 1986/87 SUGAR CANE OUTPUT SEEN FALLING
  An Agriculture Ministry survey has
  estimated the nation's 1986/87 crop sugar cane output at 2.14
  mln tonnes, down from 2.62 mln a year earlier.
      Ministry officials said the decline was due to bad weather
  and a reduction in the land under sugar cane this season, which
  totals 34,800 hectares, down from 35,700 in 1985/86, they said.
      Harvesting stretches from December 1986 to April 1987
      Japan's final output will be announced at the beginning of
  June, they said.
