CLABIR &lt;CLG>, AMBRIT &lt;ABI> CALL OFF MERGER
  Clabir Corp and AmBrit Corp
  said they called off their plans for Clabir to buy the 16 pct
  voting interest in AmBrit that it does not already own.
      The companies said they agreed not to pursue the merger
  because several actions recently taken by AmBrit would mean
  substantial delays in completing the deal.
      They said they might revive merger plans at a later date or
  seek other ways for Clabir to increase its holdings in AmBrit.
