INDONESIAN TEA, COCOA EXPORTS SEEN UP, COFFEE DOWN
  Indonesia's exports of tea and cocoa
  will continue to rise in calendar 1987 but coffee exports are
  forecast to dip slightly in 1987/88 (April-March) as the
  government tries to improve quality, the U.S. Embassy said.
      The embassy's annual report on Indonesian agriculture
  forecast coffee output in 1986/87 would be 5.77 mln bags of 60
  kilograms each. That is slightly less than the 5.8 mln bags
  produced in 1985/86.
      In 1987/88 coffee production is forecast to rise again to
  5.8 mln bags, but exports to dip to 4.8 mln from around 5.0 mln
  in 1986/87. Exports in 1985/86 were 4.67 mln bags.
      The embassy report says coffee stocks will rise to 1.3 mln
  tonnes in 1987/88 from 1.15 mln in 1986/87. It bases this on a
  fall in exports as a result of the "probable" re-introduction of
  quotas by the International Coffee Organisation.
      Cocoa production and exports are forecast to rise steadily
  as the government develops cocoa plantations. Production of
  cocoa in Indonesia increased to 32,378 tonnes in calendar 1985
  from 10,284 tonnes in 1980. It is projected by the government
  to rise to more than 50,000 tonnes by 1988.
      Production in 1986 is estimated by the embassy at 35,000
  tonnes, as against 38,000 tonnes in 1987.
      The report forecasts cocoa exports to rise to 35,000 tonnes
  this year, from 33,000 tonnes in 1986 and 31,000 in 1985.
      The Netherlands is at present the biggest importer of
  Indonesian cocoa beans.
      The report forecasts that in calendar 1987, Indonesia's CTC
  (crushed, torn and curled) tea exports will increase
  significantly with the coming on stream of at least eight new
  CTC processing plants.
      Indonesia plans to diversify its tea products by producing
  more CTC tea, the main component of tea bags.
      Production of black and green teas is forecast in the
  embassy report to rise to 125,000 tonnes in calendar 1987 from
  123,000 tonnes in 1986.
      Exports of these teas are likely to rise to 95,000 tonnes
  in 1987 from 85,000 in 1986 and around 90,000 in 1985.
      The embassy noted the ministry of trade tightened quality
  controls on tea in October 1986 in an effort to become more
  competititve in the world market.
