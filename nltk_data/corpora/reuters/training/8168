BANK OF FRANCE SAYS NO MONEY MARKET TENDER TODAY
  The Bank of France will not hold a money
  market intervention tender today, ruling out a further cut in
  its 7-3/4 pct intervention rate, central bank sources said.
      At the tenders, depending on market conditions, the Bank
  injects liquidity into the market by buying up first category
  paper. But market sources said that while the recent franc
  performance leaves room for a further quarter point cut in the
  intervention rate there was plenty of market liquidity.
      The Bank cut its rate to 7-3/4 pct from eight pct on March
  9, the first change since January 2. Interest rates also fell
  the same week in Britain, Belgium and Italy.
