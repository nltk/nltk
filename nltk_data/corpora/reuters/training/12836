SURALCO OFFERS CASH FOR WORKERS TO LEAVE
  The U.S.-owned &lt;Surinam Aluminum
  Company> (SURALCO) offered workers a lump sum and up to five
  months' wages to quit the firm because jungle-based rebels have
  disrupted bauxite mining and alumina smelting, ANP said.
      The Dutch news agency said SURALCO, a subsidiary of the
  Aluminum Company of America(ALCOA) wanted to reduce its work
  force because it had been hard hit by guerrilla attacks that
  cut power lines to the area in January.
      All bauxite mining at Moengo ceased four months ago and
  SURALCO's Paranam alumina smelter is using imported bauxite.
