EC INFLATION STARTS TO RISE AGAIN IN FEBRUARY
  Inflation in the European Community,
  which fell to its lowest since the 1960s between November and
  January, started to take off again last month, figures from the
  EC statistics office Eurostat showed.
      Consumer prices were on average three pct higher than in
  February 1986, the office said. This compared with a year on
  year rise of 2.7 pct in January, the lowest for 25 years, and
  was the highest figure since October.
      Prices rose in February by 0.3 pct from January, after
  rises of 0.4 pct in January and of 0.2 pct in each of the last
  three months of 1986.
