ARKANSAS BEST &lt;ABZ> SEES LOWER FIRST QTR NET
  Arkansas Best Corp said its
  1987 first quarter earnings will be significantly lower than
  fully diluted earnings of 22-1/2 cts per share in last year's
  first quarter.
      The company said pricing competition and lower traffic
  levels in the motor carrier industry hurt its first quarter
  results.
      However, the company said its furniture and tire operations
  are more profitable this year than last year.
      Arkansas Best also said that if the industry sustains the
  upcoming 2.9 pct motor carrier rate hike it will offset the
  Teamster labor increase scheduled for April 1.
      It said the labor increase then will be 3.2 pct for ABF
  Freight System, its largest unit.
