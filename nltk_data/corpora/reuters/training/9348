IRAN SAYS HAS BETTER WEAPONS THAN SILKWORM
  Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein
  Mousavi said Iran had "more effective" missiles at its disposal
  than the shore-to-sea missiles which had provoked U.S. Concern,
  Tehran Radio reported.
      A U.S. State Department spokesman said last week Iran had
  acquired Chinese-made Silkworm missiles which posed a greater
  threat to shipping in the Gulf than the weapons previously
  used.
      Tehran Radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp,
  quoted Mousavi as saying that Tehran officially announced after
  its forces overran southern Iraq's Faw peninsula in February
  last year that it had shore-to-sea missiles.
      "The fact that the Americans, after so much delay, are now
  thinking of expressing their concern with panic is because
  Reagan needs this sensation now," said Mousavi, speaking after a
  cabinet meeting in Tehran.
      "We also announce today that these missiles are not the
  limit of our war capabilities in the Gulf," he added.
      Mousavi said the security of the Gulf region had nothing to
  do with the U.S. But Iran would resort to any action to defend
  the Gulf, "even those actions which are not thought probable by
  Westerners."
