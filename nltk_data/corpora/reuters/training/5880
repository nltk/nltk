COCOA WORKING GROUP MEETING DELAYED
  The International Cocoa Organization
  (ICCO) buffer stock working group meeting set for 1130 GMT
  today was rescheduled for 1430, ICCO delegates said.
      The meeting was delayed so a draft compromise proposal on
  buffer stock rules could be completed, they said.
      ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn was preparing the
  plan in consultation with other delegates for presentation to
  the full working group, they added.
