TAIWAN SEES ITS INVESTMENT IN U.S. RISING SHARPLY
  Taiwanese investment in the U.S. Is
  expected to nearly double to 80 mln U.S. Dlrs in calendar 1987
  and rise to 400 mln dlrs a year by 1991, a five-year forecast
  by the Economic Ministry showed.
      Taiwanese investment in the U.S. Last year totalled 46 mln
  dlrs, the ministry document said. The investment was mainly in
  electronics, trading, food and service industries.
      Lee Ming-Yi, deputy director of the ministry's Industrial
  Development and Investment Centre, said the forecast rise is
  due to planned government incentives and growing willingness
  among Taiwanese to invest abroad.
      Lee told Reuters the incentives, to be introduced in May or
  June, include bank loans and a reduction in capitalisation
  requirements for businesses seeking to invest in the U.S. To 10
  mln Taiwan dlrs from 20 mln.
      He said the moves to encourage investment in the U.S. Are
  part of Taiwan's efforts to cut its trade surplus with
  Washington, which rose to a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs in
  1986 from 1985's 10.2 billion.
      Taiwanese manufacturers can create jobs for Americans and
  avoid import quotas if they set up plants in the U.S., He
  added.
