U.S. HOME RESALES UP IN FEBRUARY, REALTORS SAY
  The National Association of Realtors
  said sales of previously owned homes rose six pct during
  February from January levels to a seasonally adjusted annual
  rate of 3.69 mln units.
      The realtors' group said the sales rise was apparent across
  the country and reflected lower mortgage interest rates as well
  as more housing demand.
      Actual resales of homes during February totaled 241,000, up
  11.6 pct from the January total of 216,000, the association
  said.
