INTERNATIONAL PACT ON OZONE DAMAGE LIKELY IN 1987
  An international protocol to severely
  limit the use of industrial chemicals which are believed to
  damage the earth's protective ozone layer could be signed this
  year, officials and scientists here said.
      "By the end of this year, we should have an international
  protocol in place we can all be proud of," U.S. Environmental
  protection agency officer Bill Long told reporters.
      The chemicals are chiefly chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which
  are used in refrigeration and making foam plastics, solvents
  and aerosols. The earth's upper ozone layer absorbs most of the
  harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun.
      The officials and scientists were meeting in Tokyo, ahead
  of an international conference on the problem later this month
  in either Vienna, or Geneva, Long said.
      Robert Watson, a program manager for atmospheric problems
  at the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration said
  a protocol should demand an initial freeze on the use of CFCs
  by industry. This should be followed by a gradual reduction in
  CFC volume until no CFC gases are released into the air, he
  said. The U.S. Has already banned use of use CFCs in aerosols
  and Japan has asked for voluntary restraint, but both still use
  CFCs in industrial processes.
