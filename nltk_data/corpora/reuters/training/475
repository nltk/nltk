FED EXPECTED TO ADD TEMPORARY RESERVES
  The Federal Reserve is expected to
  enter the U.S. Government securities market to add temporary
  reserves, economists said.
      They expect it to supply the reserves indirectly by
  arranging a fairly large round, two billion dlrs or more, of
  customer repurchase agreements. The Fed may add the reserves
  directly instead via System repurchases.
      Federal funds, which averaged 6.02 pct on Friday, opened at
  6-1/8 pct and traded between there and 6-1/16 pct. Funds are
  under upward pressure from settlement of recently sold two-year
  notes and from a Treasury tax and loan call on banks.
