WEST GERMAN BARLEY, RAPE AFFECTED BY WINTER KILL
  Winter kill has probably affected West
  German winter barley and rapeseed to an above average degree
  this season, West German grain trader Alfred C. Toepfer said in
  its latest report.
      It is too soon to assess the extent of the damage, but it
  is likely that northern West German crops are particularly at
  risk because of insufficient snow cover, it said.
      The soil needs to warm up rapidly and moisture content must
  improve to avoid further delays to spring field work, it added.
