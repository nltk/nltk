GENCORP &lt;GY> FIXES RIGHTS SEPARATION DATE
  Gencorp Inc said that because it is
  continuing to evaluate General Acquisition Inc's tender offer
  it has fixed April 3, subject to further extension, as the date
  the rights to purchase preferred shares will trade separately
  from the common stock as a result of the tender offer.
      This extension of the expiration date is conditioned on no
  person acquiring beneficial ownership of 20 pct or more of
  Gencorp's common stock prior to April 3, it said.
      Gencorp said it could distribute the rights certificates to
  shareholders 10 to 30 days after the March 18 acquisition offer
  was made.
      However, rather than leaving the expiration date in a
  range, the board decided to set April 3 as the day it will
  distribute the preferred share purchase rights.
