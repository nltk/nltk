AMSTUTZ SAYS FARM TRADE ACCORD POSSIBLE IN 1988
  U.S. Agriculture undersecretary
  Daniel Amstutz said it is possible to reach a global agreement
  to scale-back agricultural supports in calendar 1988.
      Speaking to a Senate Agriculture Appropriations committee
  hearing, Amstutz said "I think we can reach agreement in
  calendar 1988."
      Amstutz said the U.S. places a high priority on the Uruguay
  round of global trade talks.
      His comments followed a statement by Secretary of State
  George Shultz last week urging agriculture be the highest
  priority item during the upcoming summit of western heads of
  state in Venice, Italy.
