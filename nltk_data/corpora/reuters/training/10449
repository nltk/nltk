COCOA CONSUMERS ACCEPT COMPROMISE BUFFER PLAN
  Consumer members of the International
  Cocoa Organization, ICCO, accepted a final buffer stock rules
  compromise, "on the condition that producers also agree,"
  consumer spokesman Peter Baron said.
      The full council was meeting at 1530 GMT to discuss the
  compromise, which was put together yesterday by ICCO chairman
  Denis Bra Kanon.
      Consumer delegates said they were optimistic the council
  could reach agreement on the rules fairly quickly.
