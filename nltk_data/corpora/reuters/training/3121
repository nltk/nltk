FED EXPECTED TO ADD TEMPORARY RESERVES
  The Federal Reserve is expected to
  intervene in the government securities market to add temporary
  reserves via customer repurchase agreements, economists said.
      Most economists said the Fed will add 1.5 to two billion
  dlrs of temporary reserves via customer repurchase agreements,
  but some said there is a slim chance the Fed will inject
  permanent reserves via three-day system repurchase agreements.
      Federal funds opened at 6-1/16 pct and firmed to 6-1/8 pct
  in early trading. Funds averaged six pct on Friday.
