THAILAND BUYS YUGOSLAV CRANES IN BARTER DEAL
  The Cabinet approved a plan for the
  Port Authority of Thailand to buy six gantry cranes from
  Metalna Co of Yugoslavia for about 13.4 mln dlrs, a government
  spokesman said.
      He said Thailand will pay for 25 pct of the cost of the
  cranes in U.S. Dlrs and the rest by sales of rice, textiles and
  other commodities to Yugoslavia.
      The Bangkok Shipowners and Agents Association has appealed
  to the government to scrap the purchase plan. It said it would
  be an unnecessary expense as most vessels calling at the port
  already have their own cargo handling equipment.
