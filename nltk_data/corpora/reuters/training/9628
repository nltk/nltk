U.S. CHIPMAKERS URGE SANCTIONS AGAINST JAPAN
  The Semiconductor Industry
  Association urged the U.S. government to impose trade sanctions
  against Japan for violating the U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Trade
  Agreement.
      In a letter to Treasury Secretary James Baker the group
  said sanctions should be imposed against Japanese chipmakers as
  of April 1 and should continue until the United States is
  satisfied that there is full compliance with the agreement.
      The group said action by Japan to cut back on semiconductor
  exports is not what is required.
      "America's interests require that agreements be honored and
  that U.S. industries not bear the burden for the persistent
  unwillingness or inability of the government of Japan to
  deliver on its commitments," the trade group said.
      The White House Economic Policy Council is expected to
  discuss possible sanctions against Japan at a meeting scheduled
  for Thursday.
      The trade group said Japan has not lived up to the terms of
  the agreement last year which was aimed at ending Japanese
  dumping of semiconductors and at opening Japanese markets to
  foreign-based manufacturers.
