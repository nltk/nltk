FREIGHT, INSURANCE PROPOSED FOR CCC SALES - USDA
  the U.S. Agriculture Department is
  proposing to permit coverage of freight cost and marine and war
  risk insurance for sales  of all agricultural commodities sold
  on credit terms under the Commodity Credit Corporation's, CCC,
  credit guarantee programs.
      The proposal only applies to commodities that are sold by
  exporters on a cost and freight, C and F, or cost, insurance
  and freight, CIF, basis, since these costs would be included in
  the exporter's sale price to the foreign buyer, it said.
      Under current programs, freight costs can be covered only
  for export sales of U.S. breeding animals.
      It asked for comments on the proposal by April 20.
