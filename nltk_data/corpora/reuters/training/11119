OKLAHOMA WEEKLY CROP REPORT
  The Oklahoma weekly USDA crop
  report said cold weather slowed crop development and caused
  some cattle deaths.
      Wheat growth was halted by cold weather, and rain early in
  the week prevented fertilizer application and weed spraying.
  Fields in the west were short of nitrogen, and moderate insect
  activity was noted in the southwest region.
      Wheat condition was rated 15 pct fair, 84 pct good and one
  pct excellent.
      Row crop activity was very slow amid wet conditions.
  Topsoil moisture was rated 30 pct adequate and 70 pct surplus,
  and subsoil moisture was rated 100 pct adequate. Only two days
  were suitable for fieldwork.
