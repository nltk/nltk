BRAZIL OIL OUTPUT FELL IN FEBRUARY, USAGE UP
  Brazilian crude oil and
  liquefied natural gas production fell to an average 583,747
  barrels per day in February from 596,740 in the same 1986
  month, the state oil company Petrobras said.
      The drop was due to operating problems in the Campos Basin,
  the country's main producing area, where output was down to
  346,011 bpd from 357,420, a Petrobras statement said.
      Consumption of oil derivatives totalled 1.14 mln bpd in
  February, 16.7 pct up on February last year but down from the
  record 1.22 mln bpd used in October last year. Use of alcohol
  fuel in February was 208,600 bpd, 42 pct above February, 1986.
