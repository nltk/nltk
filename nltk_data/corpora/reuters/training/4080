MALAYSIA OPTIMISTIC OVER ECONOMIC OUTLOOK FOR 1987
  Malaysia's Central Bank, Bank
  Negara, said the economic outlook for 1987 is good in view of a
  marked improvement in commodity and oil prices in the later
  months of last year.
      It said in its latest quarterly review that real gross
  domestic product averaged an annual growth of 1.1 pct over the
  first nine months of last year compared with a decline of 0.1
  pct in the corresponding period in 1985.
      Growth was generated mainly by the manufacturing sector, it
  added.
