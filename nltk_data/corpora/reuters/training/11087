LLE ROYALTY &lt;LRT> SETS MONTHLY PAYOUT
  LL and E Royalty Trust said its monthly
  dividend, for January, to unitholders will be 8.37 cts per unit
  payable April 15 to holders of record April six.
      As previously reported, pending a ruling from the Internal
  Revenues Service, the trust's distribution may be reduced by
  1.09 dlr per unit, plus interest, spread out over the life of
  the productive properties in which the trust has an interest.
      LLE said the working interest owner, to which the IRS sent
  a notice about a deficiency in the owner's 1983 tax return, is
  evaluating the necessity of escrowing some funds, which would
  significantly reduce royalties paid to the trust.
