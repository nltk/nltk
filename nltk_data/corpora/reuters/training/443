  campaign to eradicate the lethal cattle disease Rinderpest in
  Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal and Pakistan, a statement from
  a Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) meeting here said.
      Some 230 mln dlrs is needed over two years to vaccinate the
  entire susceptible cattle population in Bangladesh and Pakistan
  and high-risk areas of the other three countries. In India some
  240 mln cattle are estimated to be at risk from the disease.
