TANZANIA WANTS TO EXPORT 200,000 TONNES OF MAIZE
  Tanzania seeks to export a
  surplus of 200,000 tonnes of maize from last year's bumper
  harvest, agriculture minister Paul Bomani said yesterday.
      The 1986 maize crop was officially estimated at 2.1 mln
  tonnes, but only a fraction of this was marketed, with most
  grain consumed by the farmers who grew it.
      The state-owned National Milling Corp (NMC) meanwhile said
  it is trying to sell 190,742 tonnes of maize stored in
  different parts of the country.
      NMC acting general manager John Rubibira said Tanzania has
  only 56,000 tonnes of silo storage capacity, concentrated in
  Dar es Salaam, Arusha in the north and Iringa in central
  Tanzania.
      In addition, the country has 450,000 tonnes of flat storage
  capacity, he added.
      Rubibira said the government is planning to build new silos
  in the main maize producing areas of Iringa, Mbeya, Ruvuma and
  Rukwa.
