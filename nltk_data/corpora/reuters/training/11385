ST LAWRENCE SEAWAY OPENS SHIPPING SEASON
  The St Lawrence Seaway said the first
  ship of the season passed through the St Lambert lock here this
  morning, officially opening the 2,300-mile-long waterway's 1987
  shipping season.
      The seaway has said it expects little increase in freight
  levels this year from last year when it moved 37.6 mln tonnes
  of freight between Montreal and Lake Ontario and 41.6 mln
  tonnes on the Welland Canal, which links Lake Erie and Lake
  Ontario. The canal is scheduled to open tomorrow.
      Officials expect the waterway to lose nine to ten mln
  Canadian dlrs this year, about the same as the estimated
  deficit for fiscal 1986-87, which ends today.
