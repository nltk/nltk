NORANDA MINE SEEN BELOW FULL OUTPUT FOR MONTHS
  Noranda Inc said production
  will remain shut down at its fire-damaged copper mine here
  until it can completely examine the mine.
      If it decides to keep the mine open it would take four or
  five months before it could resume full production.
      Company spokesman Dale Coffin said the investigation could
  take from a few days to several weeks but would not be more
  specific.
      Noranda said when it resumes production it plans to operate
  the mine at about one-third of the normal 72,000 tonnes annual
  finished capacity.
      The fire, which started Wednesday and burned itself out
  late yesterday weakened part of the mine's support structure,
  Coffin said.
      One miner was killed and 56 others were trapped underground
  for about 24 hours before being brought safely out.
