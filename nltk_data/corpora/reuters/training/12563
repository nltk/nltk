YEUTTER STRESSES IMPORTANCE OF TRADE TALKS
  U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
  Yeutter stressed the importance of trade negotiations to open
  foreign markets rather than trade restrictions in a statement
  to the Senate Finance Committee.
      "In the long term we cannot repeatedly bludgeon other
  nations into opening their markets with threats of U.S.
  restrictions. Rather, we must be able to negotiate credibly for
  global liberalization," Yeutter said.
      Yeutter did not mention the recent U.S. trade sanctions
  against Japanese semiconductors in his testimony on the pending
  trade bill.
      Yeutter said the trade bill should increase U.S.
  competitiveness, aid U.S. trade negotiating leverage, and avoid
  provoking foreign retaliation.
      He urged Congress to reject provisions that would mandate
  U.S. retaliation against foreign unfair trade practices.
      Yeutter emphasized the importance of the new multilateral
  trade negotiating round and called on Congress to quickly
  approve an extension of U.S. negotiating authority.
      "We want to open foreign markets and establish and enforce
  rules of international competition, not foster dependence on
  protection and subsidies," he said.
