  Talks due today between management and
  unions to try to end the strike at Cargill U.K. Ltd's Seaforth
  oilseed crushing plant have been rescheduled for Thursday, a
  company spokesman said.
      Oilseed processing at the plant has been halted since
  December 19 when mill workers walked out in protest at new
  contract manning levels.
