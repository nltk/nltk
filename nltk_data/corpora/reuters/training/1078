FED EXPECTED TO ADD TEMPORARY RESERVES
  The Federal Reserve is expected to
  enter the U.S. Government securities market to add temporary
  reserves, economists said.
      They expect it to supply the reserves indirectly by
  arranging 1.5 to two billion dlrs of customer repurchase
  agreements. The Fed may add the reserves directly instead via
  System repurchases.
      Federal funds, which averaged 6.18 pct yesterday, opened at
  6-3/16 pct and stayed there in early trading. Analysts said the
  rate is under upward pressure partly from settlement of 8.25
  billion dlrs of five-year Treasury notes.
