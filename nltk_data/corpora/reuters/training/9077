  Trinidad and Tobago is
  finalizing arrangements with Union Carbide &lt;UK> of the United
  States and Snamprogetti of Italy for the construction of a
  1,500 tonnes per day methanol plant, Energy Minister Kelvin
  Ramnath said.
      Ramnath said the ministry is now holding talks with Union
  Carbide on the price of natural gas to be used in the plant,
  which will be constructed near the Trinidad and Tobago oil
  company (Trintoc) refinery at Point Fortin on the west coast.
      Snamprogetti built the first methanol refinery on trinidad

  machinery as equity. If negotiations go smoothly, ramnath said,
  construction could begin by next january.

  to lue new investors to the twin-island state's petrochemical
  industry, in order to make use of new findings of natural gas.
