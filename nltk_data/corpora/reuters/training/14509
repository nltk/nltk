CCC CREDITS FOR BANGLADESH AMENDED - USDA
  The Commodity Credit Corporation
  (CCC) has reallocated 5.0 mln dlrs in credit guarantees
  previously earmarked for sales of U.S. wheat to provide
  coverage for sales of U.S. vegetable oil to Bangladesh, the
  U.S. Agriculture Department said.
      USDA said the action was taken at the request of the
  Bangladesh government and reduces the guarantee line authorized
  for wheat sales from 25.0 mln dlrs to 20.0 and creates a new
  line of 5.0 mln dlrs for vegetable oils.
      To be eligible for coverage under the CCC's Intermediate
  Export Credit Program, credit terms must be in excess of three
  years, but not more than seven years.
      All sales covered by the credit guarantees must be
  registered and shipped by September 30, 1987, USDA said.
