LAWSON REPEATS HE IS CONTENT WITH STERLING LEVEL
  U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
  today repeated that he was satisfied with the current level of
  sterling, both against the dollar and the West German mark.
      Lawson said in a television interview that he did not
  regard the pound's present exchange rate was uncomfortably
  high.
      "I think it is round about right," he said.
      "I think there was a time that they (British manufacturers)
  thought the (exchange) rate was uncomfortably high. But I think
  they are very satisfied with the present level."
      "But I have made it absolutely clear that I don't want to
  see the pound go through the roof," he added.
