VERSAR &lt;VSR> TO BUY MARIETTA &lt;ML> UNIT
  Versar Inc said it has agreed
  in principle to acquire Martin Marietta Corp's Martin Marietta
  Environmental Systems unit for about 5,300,000 dlrs.
      Versar said it would use its working capital and an
  established life of credit to find the purchase, which is
  subject to approval by both boards and is expected to be
  completed in April.
      Marietta Environmental had 1986 revenues of about nine mln
  dlrs.
      Versar said the acquisition should have a "moderately"
  favorable effect on its earnings this year.
