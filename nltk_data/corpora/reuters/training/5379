CONTINENTAL AIR HOLDERS TO GET FURTHER PAYMENT
  Texas Air Corp said under a settlement
  of class action litigation with &lt;Mutual Shares Corp>, former
  minority shareholders of Continental Airlines Inc will receive
  an additional 3.75 dlrs per share.
      In February, Texas Air acquired the minority interest in
  Continental that it did not already own for 16.50 dlrs per
  share. Mutual had challenged the adequacy of the price.
      Texas Air said any former Continental holder who has sought
  appraisal rights under Delaware law may continue to seek the
  appraisal remedy in Delaware Chancery Court or accept the
  settlement and drop the appraisal process.
      Texas Air said the settlement has other terms relating to
  employee shareholdrs of Continental, who will receive options
  from Texas Air.  It did not give details.
      The company said the settlement is subject to approval by
  the Delaware Chancery Court, which is expected to take about 60
  days.
