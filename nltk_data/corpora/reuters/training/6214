HILTON &lt;HLT> SEES IMPROVED FIRST QUARTER PROFITS
  Hilton Hotels Corp expects earnings
  per share for first quarter fiscal 1987 to March 31 to be about
  90 cts compared with 70 cts a year earlier, Hilton Hotels
  division president Carl Mottek said.
      He told a news conference the company expected costs for
  its first 10 all-suite hotels, announced today, to be about 150
  mln dlrs. Initial financing would come from the company's cash
  flow. Later, Hilton plans to use borrowings from traditional
  sources, he added.
      Hilton, which hopes to build 50 all-suite hotels within
  five years, may take in partners in the new venture, he added.
