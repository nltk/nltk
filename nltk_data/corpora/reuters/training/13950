VOLCKER URGES GREATER EXCHANGE RATE STABILITY
  Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul
  Volcker said international policymakers should make improving
  the stability of exchange rates a major priority.
      In testimony before a Senate Banking subcommittee, Volcker
  said he does not have any specific proposals for improving
  exchange rate stability, but thought it was worthy goal.
      "I do think we ought to be thinking about and working toward
  greater exchange rate stability," Volcker said. "I think that the
  objective of greater exchange rate stability ought to loom
  larger among our various policy priorities."
