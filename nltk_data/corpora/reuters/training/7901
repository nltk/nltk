GPU &lt;GPU> SEES TMI-2 FUEL PROBLEMS RESOLVED
  General Public Utilities Corp
  said the water-clarity problem delaying the removal of fuel
  from the damaged Unit Two of the Three Mile Island nuclear
  power plant appears to have been resolved.
      The company said the slower than expected removal of the
  fuel, which has been primarily due to the water-clarity
  problems, is now expected to extend fuel removal into 1988.
      A spokesman said the company had previously expected this
  to be completed by the end of 1987 and has not estimated how
  far into 1988 the process will extend. It still expects to
  complete the entire clean-up by the end of 1988, he added.
      GPU said its auditors, Coopers and Lybrand, again qualified
  its opinion of GPU's financial statements, adding the recovery
  of TMI-2 decommissioning costs to the unresolved issues leading
  to the qualified opinion.
      GPU said its operating subsidiaries will seek to recover
  the costs of decommissioning TMI-2 in future rate proceedings.
      As in past years, the qualified opinion continues to list
  other uncertainties associated with the accident, which damaged
  TMI-2 -- the recovery of cleanup costs and any payments for
  damages that might exceed available insurance proceeds.
