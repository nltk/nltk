NIPPON LIGHT METAL CONTINUES ALUMINIUM OUTPUT CUT
  Nippon Light Metal Co Ltd &lt;NLGT.T>, which
  has annual capacity of 63,000 tonnes, will continue primary
  aluminium production at a rate of 35,000 tonnes owing to low
  domestic and world prices and low water supplies at its
  hydroelectric power plant, a company official said.
      Nippon, which has no plans to restore output to the 48,000
  tonnes a year at which it was working until late 1986, will
  become Japan's only smelter.
      &lt;Ryoka Light Metal Industries Ltd> will stop smelting in
  April owing to high power costs and low prices, and &lt;Mitsui
  Aluminium Co Ltd> has said it stopped smelting in February.
