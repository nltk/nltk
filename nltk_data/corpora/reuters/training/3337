FRANCE TO REQUEST PERMANENT MAIZE REBATES
  French maize producers will ask the EC
  Commission to grant permanent maize export rebates following
  the recent EC/U.S. Accord guaranteeing the U.S. An annual
  export quota of two mln tonnes of maize for Spain over four
  years, the French maize producers association, AGPM, said.
      The Commission has already decided to accord rebates for
  the export of 500,000 tonnes of French maize, of which rebates
  for around 100,000 tonnes have been granted.
      The request will be made when export certificates have been
  granted for all the 500,000 tonnes, the AGPM said.
      The association said that the request would cover exports
  to all destinations, adding that the Soviet Union, which has
  important maize needs, is currently excluded from the list of
  destination countries for the 500,000 tonnes of French maize.
      The U.S. Agriculture Department has forecast Soviet maize
  imports for the 1986/87 campaign at 4.90 mln tonnes against
  10.40 mln in 1985/86.
