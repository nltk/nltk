DRESDNER DECLINES COMMENT ON SCRIP SHARE REPORT
  A Dresdner Bank AG &lt;DRSD.F> spokesman
  said the bank had no comment on newspaper reports that
  shareholders would be offered free subscription shares.
      Dresdner shares surged to open 10.50 marks higher at
  319.50, before climbing further. Other bank stocks also rose
  strongly and dealers cited speculation already in the market
  that Deutsche Bank AG &lt;DBKG.F> would make a similar move. Such
  "scrip" issues, if they occurred, would mark the first time
  German banks had ever issued free shares.
      The varying reports said Dresdner shareholders may be
  offered one free share for every 15, 18 or 20 already held.
