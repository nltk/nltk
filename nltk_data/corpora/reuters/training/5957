NEGOTIATORS DRAFT DETAILS OF NEXT RUBBER PACT
  Rubber producers and consumers, who
  agreed last week on the central elements of a new international
  natural rubber pact, have started work on the legal drafting of
  a future accord, delegates said.
      Compromise on issues blocking an agreement was reached at a
  United Nations conference on an accord to replace the current
  pact, which expires in October.
      The new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) is
  expected to be formally adopted on Friday.
