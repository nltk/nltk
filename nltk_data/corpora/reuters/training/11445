FRENCH MARKET TALK OF SYRIAN WHEAT PURCHASES
  Syria may have bought 80,000 tonnes of
  French soft wheat, some traders here said.
      But others said it may instead have given payment
  guarantees to allow for the shipping of an old contract to go
  ahead.
      Syria has bought around 320,000 tonnes of soft French wheat
  since the beginning of the 1986/87 campaign, of which only
  121,000 tonnes had been exported by the end of last month.
      The country also bought around 30,000 tonnes of EC soft
  wheat 12 days ago at 80 to 81 dlrs a tonne, fob, they said.
