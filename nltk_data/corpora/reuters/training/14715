AMOSKEAG BANK &lt;AMKG> TO SEEK REHEARING
  Amoskeag Bank Shares Inc and
  &lt;Portsmouth Savings Bank> said they will file motions for a
  rehearing with the New Hampshire Supreme Court of its March 30
  ruling that overturned state regulatory approval of Amoskeag's
  acquisition Portsmouth.
      "The ramifications of this decision, we believe, go well
  beyond the affiliation of Amoskeag and Portsmouth Savings
  Bank," said Amoskeag chairman William S. Bushnell.
      The transaction was opposed by a group of Portsmouth
  investors who wanted the bank to remain independent, according
  to press reports.
