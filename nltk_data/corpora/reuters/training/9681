EXCHANGE RATE BILL CLEARS U.S. HOUSE PANEL
  The House Banking Committee adopted
  legislation to direct the U.S. Treasury to begin negotiations
  aimed at seeking regular adjustment of exchange rates by  
  countries such as Taiwan and South Korea whose currencies are
  pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar.
      The measure was adopted as part of a wide-ranging trade
  bill that will be considered by the full House in April before
  it moves onto the Senate.
      The bill's many provisions also set as a priority for the
  U.S. the negotiation of stable exchange rates and urge
  government intervention as necessary to offset fluctuations.
