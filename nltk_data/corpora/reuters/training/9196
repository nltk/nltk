SINGAPORE GDP TO GROW SIX PCT IN FIRST QUARTER
  Singapore's gross domestic product
  will grow six pct in the first quarter and five pct in the
  second quarter this year, with further growth expected in the
  second half, Trade and Industry Minister Lee Hsien Loong told
  parliament.
      The figures compared with 3.4 pct contraction and 1.2 pct
  growth respectively for the first and second quarters of 1986.
      The estimates were based on a tentative leading indicator
  incorporating new business orders, company inventories and
  share prices used by his ministry, Lee said, without giving
  further details of the new indicator.
      Singapore's economy grew 1.9 pct last year, after shrinking
  1.8 pct in 1985. The government has forecast growth rate of
  three to four pct for 1987.
