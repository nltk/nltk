C.T.C. DEALER EXTENDS BID FOR CANADIAN TIRE
  C.T.C. Dealer Holdings Ltd said it
  extended its previously announced offer for 49 pct of &lt;Canadian
  Tire Corp Ltd> to midnight on March 26.
      CTC, a group of Canadian Tire dealers, which already owns
  17 pct of Canadian Tire, is currently appealing in an Ontario
  court against a previously announced Ontario Securities
  Commission ruling blocking CTC's 272 mln dlr bid.
      The blocked bid did not include non-voting shareholders,
  who hold 96 pct of Canadian Tire equity.
