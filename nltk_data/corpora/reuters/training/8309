  Treasury Secertary James Baker said
  currencies were now within ranges that better reflected
  economic fundamentals.
      In a speech to the annual meeting of the Inter-American
  Development Bank, he said, "Excchange have moved into ranges
  that better reflect economic fundamentals."
      He noted that in particular that dollar has fallen from its
  high point in early 1985 helping to moderate protectionist
  pressures in the U.S.
