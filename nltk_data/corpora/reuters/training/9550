U.S. OFFERS MORE CREDITS FOR VEG OIL TO N. YEMEN
  The U.S. Commodity Credit
  Corporation (CCC) has authorized an additional 10.0 mln dlrs in
  credit guarantees to cover sales of U.S. vegetable oils to
  North Yemen, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
      The department also said at the request of the North Yemen
  Government five mln dlrs in credit guarantees previously
  earmarked for sales of wheat have been switched to cover sales
  of mixed poultry feed.
      The actions increase the value of credit guarantees for
  vegetable oil for the current fiscal year to 38 mln dlrs,
  reduce the guarantee coverage for sales of wheat to eight mln
  dlrs and increase the coverage for sales of mixed poultry feed
  to 10 mln dlrs.
      All exports must be completed by September 30, 1987.
