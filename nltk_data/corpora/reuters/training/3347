UNION, SHIPPERS AGREE TO CUT N.Y. PORT COSTS
  The New York Shipping Association and
  International Longshoremen's Association said they agreed to
  cut cargo assessments at the Port of New York and New Jersey by
  more than 50 pct on some labor intensive cargos.
      The charges on cargo handled by union workers will be
  reduced to 2.85 dlrs a ton from 5.85 dlrs a ton, effective
  April one, according to the agreement between the union and
  shippers. The assessments are used to fund workers' benefits.
      "What were doing is lowering the price to get more bulk
  cargo flowing through here," a spokesman for the New York
  Shipping Association said.
