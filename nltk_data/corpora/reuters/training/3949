U.S. CORN DEMAND GROWING IN JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA
  The recent purchase of 1.5 mln
  tonnes of U.S. corn by Japan and 600,000 tonnes by South Korea
  suggests that the two countries' demand for reliable supplies
  of corn is increasing, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
      In its World Production and Trade Report, the department
  said that view is reinforced by the expectation of a decline in
  exportable supplies of Argentine corn and uncertainty over the
  availability of South African and Chinese corn.
      With these corn purchases, Japan is committed to buying 7.7
  mln tonnes of U.S. corn in 1986/87 (Sept-Aug), nearly 400,000
  tonnes greater than year-ago figures to date.
      South Korea's cumulative commitments amount to 2.5 mln
  tonnes, up 1.5 mln compared to last year, it said.
