U.S. WHEAT GROWERS SET STATE DEPT TRADE MEETING
  The National Association of Wheat
  Growers, NAWG, board of directors is scheduled to meet
  Secretary of State George Schultz and Undersecretary of State
  Allen Wallis to discuss the Department's current role in farm
  trade policy, the association said.
      NAWG President Jim Miller said in a statement that the
  organization wanted to convey to Secretary Schultz the
  importance that exports hold for U.S. agriculture and the
  degree to which farmers are dependent upon favorable State
  Department trade policies to remain profitable.
      "Foreign policy decisions of the U.S. State Department have
  in the past severely hampered our efforts to move our product
  to overseas markets," he said.
      Miller noted Secretary Schultz is scheduled to meet next
  month with representatives of the Soviet Union, and the NAWG
  "wanted to be certain the secretary was aware of our concerns
  regarding the reopening of wheat trade with the Soviet Union."
      The annual spring NAWG board of directors meeting is held
  in Washington to allow grower-leaders from around the country
  to meet with their state congressional delegations and members
  of the executive branch.
      The purpose is to discuss the current situation for
  producing and marketing wheat and help set the legislative and
  regulatory agenda for the coming year, the NAWG statement said.
