EC CONCERNED OVER U.S. TEXTILE IMPORT MOVES
  The European Community (EC) expressed
  disquiet over protectionist moves in the United States to limit
  imports of textiles and said it would retaliate immediately if
  EC exports were hit.
      A spokeswoman for the EC Commission said EC External Trade
  Commissioner Willy De Clercq had written to his U.S.
  Counterpart, special U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter,
  outlining the concerns of the 12-nation Community.
      The draft legislation under consideration by Congress would
  impose permanent quotas on products entering the U.S. and seek
  to limit any increase to a growth in the overall trade.
