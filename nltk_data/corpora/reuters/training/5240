SWEDISH INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION FALLS IN JANUARY
  Sweden's industrial production fell
  1.8 pct during January compared with a fall of 0.8 pct the
  month before and remains unchanged compared with January 1986,
  according to figures from the Central Bureau of Statistics.
      The bureau attributed the fall to a long Christmas break
  and particularly cold weather, which lowered production in the
  forestry industry.
