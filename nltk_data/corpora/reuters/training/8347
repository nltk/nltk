SWEDISH GNP ROSE LESS THAN EXPECTED, FIGURES SHOW
  Sweden's Gross National Product rose
  1.3 pct last year against 2.3 pct in 1985, mainly due to a
  lower than forecast growth in exports and a sharp fall in total
  investments, the Central Bureau of Statistics reported.

  pct in 1985 whereas the Finance Ministry had expected an
  increase of only 3.6 pct. Total investments fell 0.7 pct
  against a rise of 6.3 pct in 1985. The Finance Ministry had
  forecast a rise of 0.3 pct in 1986.
