NESTLE SEEKING AUTHORISATION FOR CERTIFICATE ISSUE
  Nestle SA &lt;NESZ.Z> said it
  would seek shareholder approval to issue participation
  certificates up to 20 pct of share capital, instead of the
  current limit of 10 pct.
      It said it wanted this authorisation in view of future
  certificate issues. Nestle's nominal capital amounts to 330 mln
  Swiss francs.
      Nestle reported net profits of 1.79 billion francs for
  1986, up 2.2 pct from 1985, while turnover fell 9.9 pct to
  38.05 billion as the Swiss franc strengthened against other
  currencies.
      The parent company's net profit rose to 666.6 mln francs
  from 592.9 mln in 1985, and the company planned an unchanged
  dividend of 145 francs per share and 29 francs per certificate
  after placing 170 mln francs in reserves, against 95 mln last
  year.
      The payout represented 27.6 pct of group net profit,
  against 28.2 pct last year.
      Nestle said it had also invited Fritz Leutwiler, former
  president of the Swiss National Bank and currently chairman of
  BBC AG Brown Boveri und Cie &lt;BBCZ.Z>, to join the Nestle board.
