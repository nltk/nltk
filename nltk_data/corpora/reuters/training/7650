TWA &lt;TWA> IN COURT SETTLEMENT WITH USAIR &lt;U>
  Trans World Airlines Inc said it
  reached an agreement yesterday in federal court with USAir
  Group Inc that prevents TWA from buying additional shares of
  USAir.
      Under the agreement, TWA, which holds about 15 pct of USAir
  stock, will not buy more USAir shares before April 23 and will
  not do so after that date without giving 14 days notice to
  USAir.
      TWA also agreed that it would not knowingly and willingly
  interfere with the consummation of the merger between USAir and
  Piedmont Aviation Inc &lt;PIE>.
      TWA said the court agreement confirms previous
  announcements by the company, in filings with the Securities
  and Exchange Commission, that it does not presently intend to
  seek control of USAir or to acquire additional common stock.
      As a result of the agreement, the court removed a previous
  temporary restraining order against TWA, the company said.
      TWA and USAir have also agreed that all litigation between
  them in Pittsburgh and Delaware will be stayed until April 23.
  TWA said the agreement does not prevent it from commenting to
  regulatory agencies on the USAir, Piedmont merger.
      In a separate statement, USAir said the agreement also
  included a provision that all USAir shares currently owned by
  TWA and its chairman, Carl Icahn, will be voted through a
  voting trust in proportion to the votes of other shares not
  controlled by TWA or Icahn.
