INT'L MINERALS PROJECT TO BOOST HOG LEAN WEIGHT
  International Minerals and
  Chemical Corp said its board approved a 50 mln dlrs budget over
  the next several years to build production facilities for a
  newly developed product to be used to improve the lean weight
  of hogs.
      The new product, porcine somatotropin (PST) is described as
  a natural bio-synthetic protein that improves the lean weight
  and rate of weight gain, as well as reduces the cost of feed
  for market hogs, the company said.
      Specific details of the PST production project, including
  sites for proposed facilities and engineering plans, were not
  disclosed. International Minerals said it set a completion
  target for the spring of 1989, by which time necessary Food and
  Drug Administration approvals are expected to be obtained.
