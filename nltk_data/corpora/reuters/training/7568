BANK OF FINLAND WILL ANNOUNCE NEW MEASURES
  The Bank of Finland called a news
  conference at 1200 GMT to announce new measures for the
  "development of the system of monetary control."
      A spokesman for the Bank declined to give further details.
      Banking sources said they expected the bank to announce it
  will actively take part in the interbank market and buy and
  sell certificates of deposit.
      The state treasury issues government paper with a maturity
  of up to one year. The central bank has so far not issued its
  own paper, the sources said.
