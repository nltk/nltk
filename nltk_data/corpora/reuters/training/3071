STORA CLOSE TO COMPLETING PAPYRUS TAKEOVER
  Sweden's Stora Kopparbergs Bergslags
  AB &lt;SKPS.ST> said it has now acquired 90 pct of shares in rival
  pulp and paper makers Papyrus AB, thus passing the threshold
  above which it can compulsorily buy the rest of the company.
      Remaining shareholders would have until later this month to
  sell their shares to Stora, the company said in a statement.
      Stora announced last September it would acquire Papyrus at
  a price of 5.8 billion crowns, thus forming Europe's second
  largest forest group after London-based Reed International Plc
  &lt;REED L>.
