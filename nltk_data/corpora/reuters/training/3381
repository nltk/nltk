CEASARS WORLD &lt;CAW> STUDYING SOSNOFF OFFER
  Ceasars Wold Inc said its board is
  studying the unsolicited and conditional tender offer for all
  its common shares at 28 dlrs per share from Martin T. Sosnoff.
      A company spokesman said the board expects to make a
  recommendation "shortly", but could not specify a time period.
      Ceasars World Chairman Henry Gluck in a statement urged
  shareholders not to take any action with respect to the offer
  prior to the board's recommendation.
      Sosnoff made the offer directly to shareholders in a
  newspaper advertisement through a company he formed, called MTS
  Acquisition Corp. It expires April 3.
