U.K. MONEY MARKET LIQUIDITY POSITION EXPECTED FLAT
  The Bank of England said it has forecast
  a flat position in the money market today.

  treasury bills will drain 545 mln stg and a rise in note
  circulation 35 mln stg but the outflow will be offset by 490
  mln stg exchequer transactions and bankers balances above
  target 70 mln.
