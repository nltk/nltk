CANADA RULING ON U.S. CORN INJURY DUE THIS WEEK
  The Canadian government is expected
  to announce later this week its final ruling whether U.S. corn
  exports to Canada have injured Ontario corn growers, U.S.
  government and farm group representatives said.
      The deadline for a final determination is March 7.
      U.S. officials said they are encouraged by the outcome in a
  similar case covering European pasta imports. In that case,
  Canada decided pasta imports, which take about ten pct of the
  Canadian market, did not injure domestic producers. U.S. corn
  exports represent only about five pct of the Canadian market.
      Canada slapped a 1.05 dlrs per bushel duty on U.S. corn
  imports in November 1986, but reduced the duty to 85 cts last
  month because the Canadian government said U.S. subsidies to 
  corn producers were less than Canada earlier estimated.
