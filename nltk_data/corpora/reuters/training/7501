COSTA RICA SELLS SUGAR TO SOVIET UNION
  Costa Rica has agreed to sell more
  than 32,000 tonnes of sugar this year to the Soviet Union, a
  spokesman for local producers said.
       Miguel Alfaro, president of the agricultural league of the
  sugar cane industry, said the sale follows a recent 50 pct cut
  in Costa Rica's quota for sugar exports to the U.S.
      Alfaro said up to 45,000 tonnes of sugar could be exported
  to the Soviet Union this year under the deal, which is similar
  to one the Soviets made recently with the Dominican Republic.
      A Soviet ship will load 25,000 tonnes at the Pacific port
  of Punta Morales Monday, Alfaro said, and a second ship will
  take an additional 7,107 tonnes two days later.
      Alfaro and other industry sources declined to disclose the
  price at which the sugar was sold.
