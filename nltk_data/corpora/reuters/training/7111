BLOCKBUSTER ENTERTAINMENT &lt;BBEC> SELLING UNIT
  Blockbuster Entertainment Corp said it
  will sell its investment in Amtech Corp to the company
  chairman, David Cook, and president, Kenneth Anderson.
      The company said the sale is taking place because Amtech is
  not compatible with Blockbuster's main line of business, will
  require substaintial additional funding to develop and market
  its product, and is expected to sustain operating losses for
  the forseeable future.
      The company said Cook and Anderson will form a new company
  with the sale called Amtech Holdings Inc.
