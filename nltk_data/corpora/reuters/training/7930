DELTA SAYS COURT ORDER WILL NOT DELAY MERGER
  Delta Air Lines &lt;DAL> said a court
  order requiring Western Air Lines &lt;WAL> to arbitrate with two
  of its unions will not delay the April 1 merger between the two
  airlines.
      The order, which was issued by the Ninth Circuit Court of
  Appeals, requires Western to discuss with its two unions
  whether Western's labor contracts will be binding for Delta,
  Delta said.
      "Nevertheless, the court order could cause significant
  personnel problems, including the possible delay of wage
  increases Delta had planned to give the Western personnel on
  April 1," Ronald Allen, Delta's president, said.
      Delta said it feels the court has erred and should
  reconsider the order.
