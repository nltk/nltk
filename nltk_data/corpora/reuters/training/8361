  Gencorp Inc said it filed suit
  against the unsolicited 100 dlr-a-share tender offer of Wagner
  and Brown and AFG INdustries.
      Gencorp said it is seeking an injunction against the offer
  because it is violates federal securities laws and margin

  and will make a decision on whether or not shareholders should
  accept or reject it by March 31.
