IOWA BEEF LIFTS LOCKOUT AT DAKOTA CITY
  Iowa Beef Processors Inc is lifting a
  lockout at its Dakota City, Nebraska, processing plant and
  plans to resume operations March 16, United Food and Commercial
  Workers (UFCW) Union spokesman Allen Zack said.
      Iowa Beef mailed a letter to members of UFCW Local 222
  informing them a lockout imposed by the company December 14
  would be lifted and meatpackers could return to work under Iowa
  Beef's "revised, last and best final offer," Zack said.
      Iowa Beef had closed the plant indefinitely in mid-December
  because it said it had no alternative to threats by meatpackers
  to disrupt operations.
      About 2,800 members of Local 222 are affected by the
  shutdown. A 3-1/2 year labor contract at the plant expired
  December 13.
