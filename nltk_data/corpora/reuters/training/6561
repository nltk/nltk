ARISTECH &lt;ARS> TO INCREASE PRODUCTION CAPACITY
  Aristech Chemical Corp said it plans
  to increase production capacity for three of its key product
  lines: polypropylene, bisphenol-A and phenol.
      Aristech said the polypropylene expansion involves a major
  modernization of its Neal, W. Va., polypropylene plant.
      When completed, Aristech said, the project would increase
  the plant's annual production to 264 mln pounds from 165 mln
  pounds now.
      Aristech said the expansion will increase the company's
  total polypropylene, a thermoplastic resin, capacity to 600 mln
  pounds annually from 515 mln pounds now.
      Aristech also said it will expand bisphenol-A and phenol
  production at its Haverhill, Ohio plant.
      It said the project will raise its bisphenol-A, which is
  used to make polycarbonate and epoxy reins, capacity to 192 mln
  pounds per year from 165 mln pounds now.
      Aristech added that phenol production will increase to 610
  mln pounds per year from 585 mln pounds a year now.
      Phenol is used to make phenolic resins and adhesives for
  engineering plastics, the company said.
