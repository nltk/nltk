FINANCIAL CORP &lt;FIN> NOT HOLDING BUYOUT TALKS
  Financial Corp of America said
  it is not holding discussions with anyone regarding a buyout of
  the company.
      But a spokeswoman pointed out that Financial Corp has said
  publicly for nearly two years that in the company's view a
  merger would be one method of increasing the company's capital.
      "If an opportunity arises for us to strengthen our capital
  position quickly we would be very open to it," the spokeswoman
  said.
      Financial Corp would need over one billion dlrs to bring
  its regulatory net worth up to Federal Savings and Loan
  Insurance Corp requirements, the spokeswoman said.
      In addition, she said that the Federal Home Loan Bank
  Board, in a letter dated January 26, 1987, stated that through
  March 31, 1988 it will continue to support the company's
  efforts to restructure its balance sheet, maintain profitable
  operations and augment net worth.
