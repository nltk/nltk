  Armtek Corp, formerly known as
  Armstrong Rubber Co, said it signed agreements with &lt;Condere
  Corp> for the sale of its Natchez, Miss. tire plant and its S
  and A Truck Tire Sales and Services Corp.
      Terms were not disclosed. Armtek spokesman John Sievers
  said S and A is a 50 mln dlr business.
      Earlier this week, Armtek announced the sale of its
  industrial tire and assembly business division to Dyneer Corp
  of Scotsdale, Ariz.
      Cash proceeds from both sales will be used to reduce
  outstanding debt.
       Under a long term supply agreement with Condere, it is
  anticipated that truck tires produced at the Natchez plant will
  be supplied to the Armstrong Tire Co, an Armtek operating
  company, the company said.
      The closing is scheduled to be concluded by March 31, it
  said.
