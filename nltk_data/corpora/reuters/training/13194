INVESTOR MULLS KAPPA&lt;KPA>-RADIATION&lt;RADS> MERGER
  Michael Krupp, a Golden, Colo.,
  businessman and major shareholder of Kappa Networks Inc, said
  he and Kappa's management are considering seeking a merger
  between Kappa and Radiation Systems Inc.
      In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
  Krupp said companies he controls and Kappa acquired a combined
  292,000 Radiation System shares, or 5.25 pct of the total.
      Krupp, who has a 24.4 pct stake in Kappa, said he and Kappa
  management believe a Kappa-Radiation Systems combination would
  be good for both companies. But no decision has been made on
  whether or how to proceed with a merger attempt, he added.
