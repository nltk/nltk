VIETNAM'S ARMY ORDERED TO GROW MORE FOOD
  Vietnam has ordered its army to grow
  more food to ease shortages and meet economic recovery goals
  set for 1990.
      The army newspaper Quan Doi Nhan Dan, monitored here, said
  soldiers must work harder to care for rice, vegetables and
  other crops endangered by the present unusually hot weather.
      The paper said the 1.6-mln strong regular army contributed
  less than one pct to the nation's 18.2 mln tonne food output.
      North Vietnam has set a 1990 food target of 23 to 24 mln
  tonnes.
