  Sri Lankan Food Department officials

  offer of 80 U.S. Dlrs per tonne CAF to supply 52,500 tonnes of
  soft wheat to Colombo from the Pacific Northwest.
      They said Sri Lanka's Food Department subsequently made a

      The company which obtains USDA approval for the proposed
  price must inform the Department before 1330 gmt, they said.
