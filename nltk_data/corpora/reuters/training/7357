RAISE IN BRAZIL FCOJ EXPORT PRICES NOT CONFIRMED
  There is no confirmation
  that Brazil's major processors of Frozen Concentrated Orange
  Juice, FCOJ, will raise export prices of the product to 1,375
  dlrs per tonne from April 1, a spokesman for the Brazilian
  Association of Citrus Juice Industries (Abrassuco) said.
      Asked to comment on a report from New York that Cutrale and
  Citrosuco had sent telexes to customers informing of the price
  raise, Jose Carlos Goncalves said Abrassuco was not aware of
  it.
      "All we know is that Cacex has increased the dollar amount
  to translate FOB price to ex-dock New York price to 1,050 dlrs
  from 770 dlrs," Goncalves said.
      Citrosuco and Cutrale officials were not available for
  comment.
