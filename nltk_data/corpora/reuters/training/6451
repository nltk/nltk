  pct of India's total production of zinc.
      A total 55 mln stg of the grant is allocated for the supply
  of goods and services from Britain. The grant comes as part of
  package announced on March 13 for Indian mineral development.
      The agency is also paying a further 31 mln stg to India's
  coal sector, for the expansion of its indigenous coal
  development programme, using British-designed longwall
  technology.
