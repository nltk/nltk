      Coupon rates on 10-year certificates maturing March 1995
  will fall to 9.80 pct from 13.65 pct and rates on 10-year
  issues maturing in March 1996 would fall to 10.05 pct from
  14.30 pct.
      The Treasury also cut by 0.60 point six-monthly coupons

      The issues carry terms of between five and seven years and
  will have coupon rates of between 4.85 and 5.65 pct in
  September compared with 5.45 and 6.25 pct this March.
