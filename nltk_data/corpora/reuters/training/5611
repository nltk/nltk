U.S. SENATOR UNCOMMITTED ON OFFERING 0/92 BILL
  Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana,
  ranking Republican on the U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee,
  has not decided whether to introduce an administration-backed
  bill to apply the so-called 0/92 provision to 1988 through 1990
  grain crops, an aide to the senator said.
      The Reagan administration has asked Lugar to offer the
  measure, the aide said.
      However, a number of farm groups have told Lugar they
  oppose the proposal on the grounds it would reopen the 1985
  farm bill, and the senator has decided to take a second look at
  the proposal, the aide said.
      Last week the aide indicated Lugar was planning to offer
  the 0/92 measure and a bill to tighten a payment limitation
  loophole.
