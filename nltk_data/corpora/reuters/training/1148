COPPER STUDY GROUP CONSIDERED AT GENEVA MEETING
  Major copper producing and consuming
  countries are considering a U.S. proposal to set up a study
  group to review the world copper market, delegates said.
      The U.S. initiative was introduced last December at a
  meeting held here under the auspices of the United Nations
  Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).
      The U.S., the world's largest copper consumer and second
  biggest producer after Chile, has proposed setting up a body to
  improve statistics and market transparency of the copper
  economy, and provide a forum for discussion.
      The new body would not aim at negotiating measures to
  stabilise depressed world prices.
      This week's meeting, which began yesterday, is due to end
  Friday.
