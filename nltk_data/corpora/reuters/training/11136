OLSON INDUSTRIES &lt;OLSN> TO SELL EGG OPERATIONS
  Olson Industries Inc said
  it signed a letter of intent to sell substantially all of its
  remaining egg operations to Sunny Fresh Foods inc.
      Olson said it expects to receive about nine mln dlrs from a
  combination of a sale of tangible assets to Sunny Fresh and
  realization of intangible and other assets by Olson.
      The transaction is expected to result in a charge for
  discontinued operations of about two mln dlrs but is also
  expected to generate substantial cash flow to pay off
  egg-related indebtedness of about 7.5 mln dlrs and to further
  improve working capital.
