BAKER SAYS G-6 PACT JUST A START
  Treasury Secretary James Baker said
  the agreement among industrial nations in Paris last month is
  only a start in Washington's drive to intensify economic
  cooperation among leading countries.
      In a speech to the National Newspaper Association, Baker
  said "the six steps beginning with the Plaza Agreement and
  culminating in the Paris Accord, are only a start."
      He added "we see our role as a steward of a process in which
  we sit down with our industrial allies to find ways to promote
  more balanced international growth."
      The Paris agreements called trade surplus countries to
  strengthen their growth and on the U.S. to reduce its budget
  deficit. Under such circumstances, the countries agreed their
  currencies were within ranges broadly consistent with economic
  fundamentals.
      Baker also said he still sees "ominous" signs of pressure for
  protectionist trade legislation "and this pressure for
  protectionism is coming from new areas of society."
      But he also said he believed a coalition was forming that
  supported free trade.
