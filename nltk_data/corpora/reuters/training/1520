EC BACKS NEW MOVE TO ENCOURAGE UNLEADED GASOLINE
  The EC Executive Commission has backed
  a plan to allow member countries to ban regular leaded gasoline
  in a move designed to encourage use of unleaded fuel.
      It said in a statement it backed a proposal to allow EC
  states to ban sales of regular grade gasoline containing lead
  at six months notice. The proposal, which needs approval by EC
  ministers, would not force any member state to impose the ban.
  "It's an option, not an obligation," a spokesman said.
      But the Commission said imposing the ban would encourage
  the use of unleaded fuel, as well as making it easier for gas
  stations by cutting the number of types of gasoline they had to
  stock.
