COURIER &lt;CRRC> SEES SECOND QUARTER LOSS
  Courier Corp said it expects to
  report a small loss for the second fiscal quarter against a
  profit of 828,000 dlrs a year ago.
      The company attributed the loss to competitive pressures
  which have cut gross margins. In addition, it said it is
  incurring significant expenses from management programs aimed
  at reducing costs and boosting productivity.
      It said its Murray Printing Co unit has undertaken a
  program of extended work hours, and salary and job cuts which
  will save more than 1.5 mln dlrs annually.
