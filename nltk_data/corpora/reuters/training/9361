FED EXPECTED TO ADD RESERVES IN MARKET
  The Federal Reserve will probably
  intervene in the government securities market to add reserves
  today, economists said.
      They expected the Fed will supply temporary reserves
  indirectly via 1.5 to two billion dlrs of customer repurchase
  agreements.
      Fed funds hovered at a relatively high 6-1/4 pct this
  morning after averaging 6.14 pct on Tuesday.
      Early this afternoon the Fed also is expected to supply
  reserves permanently, effective Thursday, by offering to buy
  all maturities of Treasury bills.
