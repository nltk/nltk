EUROPEAN COMMUNITY TO SET UP OFFICE IN PEKING
  China and the European Community (EC)
  signed an agreement on the establishment of an EC office here.
      Chinese vice-foreign minister Zhou Nan and the EC's
  external relations commissioner, Willy De Clercq, signed the
  accord. EC sources said the office was likely to open in the
  second half of this year.
      In 1986 the EC was China's third largest trading partner,
  with Chinese imports from the EC worth 5.7 billion dlrs and
  exports worth 2.6 billion dlrs.
      De Clercq told the official China Daily that more joint
  ventures should be set up in China as a way of reducing China's
  trade deficit with the EC.
      The EC's affairs in China are currently looked after by
  whichever country holds the group's six-monthly rotating
  presidency, now held by the Belgians until the Danes take over
  in July.
