DUTCH PARLIAMENT OFFERS LITTLE HELP IN PORT ROW
  Dutch members of parliament said they
  could do little to help resolve the dispute over redundancies
  in Rotterdam port's general cargo sector and urged the union
  and employers to sort out their differences themselves.
      Both sides gave evidence to the all-party standing
  committee on Social Affairs today, but committee members said
  they saw little chance of parliamentary intervention.
      The dispute began on January 19 in protest at employers'
  plans for 800 redundancies from the 4,000-strong workforce,
  starting with 350 this year. The port and transport union, FNV,
  is to challenge the redundancies in an Amsterdam court
  tomorrow.
