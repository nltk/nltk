FRANCE, YUGOSLAVIA COMMISSION TO BOOST TRADE
  France and Yugoslavia agreed to set up a
  joint economic commission as part of efforts to promote
  commercial links and industrial cooperation between the two
  countries.
      The French Finance Ministry said the commission, to be
  composed of businessmen, was agreed during talks between
  Foreign Trade Minister Michel Noir and Yugoslavian minister
  without portfolio Egon Padovan.
      A ministry statement said both sides had agreed on the need
  to boost trade links in keeping with an accord signed last year
  calling for a 50 pct rise in commercial exchanges between the
  two countries over the next six years.
      French trade with Yugoslavia has grown little over the past
  two years.
