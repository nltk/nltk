CANADA CORN DECISION UNJUSTIFIED - YEUTTER
  U.S. trade representative Clayton
  Yeutter said Canada's finding announced today that U.S. corn
  imports injure Canadian farmers is "totally unjustified."
      "U.S. corn exports to Canada are so small that it is
  inconceivable that they injure Canadian corn farmers by any
  reasonable measure," Yeutter said in a statement.
      He said if other countries follow Canada's lead it could
  result in "a rash of protectionist actions throughout the
  world." French corn growers have recently indicated they will
  challenge U.S. corn gluten feed shipments to Europe.
      Yeutter said the U.S. will examine the Canadian decision
  closely and if the U.S. believes the decision was not based on
  facts, "will carefully evaluate appropriate responses." Yeutter
  did not say what steps the U.S. may take in response.
