BRUNSWICK &lt;BC> SEES HIGHER 1987 FIRST QUARTER
  Brunswick Corp expects 1987 first
  quarter sales to be up "dramatically" and profits to "do well,"
  chairman and president Jack Reichert said after a securities
  analysts meeting.
      He declined to be more specific.
      In the 1986 first quarter, Brunswick reported earnings of
  23.8 mln dlrs or 57 cts a share on sales of 396.7 mln dlrs.
      Reichart noted that results of its two newly-acquired boat
  manufacturing companies will be included in the company's first
  quarter report.
      Brunswick expects its recreation centers to benefit from
  increased attention to the sport of bowling resulting from
  acceptance in the 1988 Summer Olympics of bowling as an
  exhibition sport and as a medal sport in the 1991 Pan American
  Games, he said.
      He said field testing of a new bowling concept involving
  electronic features is being readied for test marketing this
  summer, and if successful, could "materially benefit"
  operations.
      Brunswick is currently test marketing in California a
  health club facility adjoining a bowling center, he said.
      Turning to its defense operations, Reichert said he expects
  the division to receive significant contracts in the near
  future. At 1986 year end, Brunswick's defense contract backlog
  stood at 425 mln dlrs.
      Frederick Florjancic, vice president-finance, told analysts
  Brunswick was disappointed two credit rating services recently
  downgraded the company's debt which stood at about 665.4 mln
  dlrs at 1986 year end.
      "We are confident we can service our debt and bring it down
  in the very near term," based on strong cash flow from
  Brunswick's expanded boat operations, Florjancic said.
      Shareholders at the company's April 27 annual shareholders
  meeting will be asked to approve an increase in the authorized
  common shares outstanding to 200 mln from 100 mln shares, a
  company spokesman said.
