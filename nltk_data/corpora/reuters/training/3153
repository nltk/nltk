TWA &lt;TWA> DECLINES COMMENT ON USAIR &lt;U>
  A Transworld Airlines Inc official said
  the airline has no comment on USAir Group Inc's planned buyout
  of Piedmont Aviation Inc.
      TWA, however, has pursued its application with the
  Department of Transportation for a takeover of USAir, according
  to Mark Buckstein, TWA general counsel and vice president. TWA
  filed a revised application today, following the DOT's
  rejection Friday of an incomplete application filed last week.
      Earlier USAir said it agreed to buy Piedmont for 69 dlrs
  cash per share.
