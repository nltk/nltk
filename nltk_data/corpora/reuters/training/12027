TREASURY'S BAKER HOPES PRIME RATE RISE TEMPORARY
  Treasury Secretary James Baker said
  he hopes yesterday's small increase in two major money center
  banks' prime rate was a temporary phenomenon.
      "I hope it was a temporary blip upward," he told a House
  Appropriations subcommittee.
      He said the decline in interest rates since President
  Reagan took office remains "one of the significant
  accomplishments, in the economic area, of this administration."
