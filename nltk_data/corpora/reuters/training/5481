SOME 7,000 MINERS GO ON STRIKE IN SOUTH AFRICA
  Some 7,000 black miners went on
  strike at South African gold and coal mines, the National Union
  of Mineworkers (NUM) said.
      A NUM spokesman said 6,000 workers began an underground
  sit-in at the Grootvlei gold mine, owned by General Union
  Mining Corp, to protest the transfer of colleagues to different
  jobs.
     He said about 1,000 employees of Anglo American Corp's New
  Vaal Colliery also downed tools but the reason for the stoppage
  was not immediately clear. Officials of the two companies were
  not available for comment and the NUM said it was trying to
  start negotiations with management.
