RICE, CORN LEAD 1987 U.S. FARM PAYMENTS - USDA
  Rice and corn farmers will receive
  the largest payments from the U.S. government during 1987 if
  the subsidies are calculated per planted acre, the U.S.
  Agriculture Department said.
      USDA said government outlays to rice farmers in 1987 are
  expected to reach 403 dlrs per acre planted, followed by corn
  at 135 dlrs per planted acre. Government outlays include mainly
  deficiency payments and price support loans.
      On a per acre basis, cotton payments will reach 73.24 dlrs
  in 1987, wheat 60.30 dlrs, sorghum 54.38 dlrs, barley 27.41
  dlrs and oats 2.31 dlrs, USDA said.
      USDA estimates farm subsidies will reach 25.3 billion dlrs
  in 1987. The figures were given by USDA officials at a Senate
  Agriculture Appropriations hearing yesterday.
