JAPAN DENIES PLANS TO CUT DUTIES ON CHOCOLATE
  Agriculture Ministry officials said they
  are not considering cuts in import duties on chocolate to help
  ease friction with the United States over agricultural trade.
      Japan has already lowered the duties sharply and we must
  consider domestic market conditions, an official said.
      Duties on chocolate were cut to 20 pct from 31.9 pct in
  April 1983.
      Washington has been demanding a cut to seven pct,
  equivalent to its own duties, ministry sources said.
      Japanese chocolate imports rose to 8,285 tonnes in calendar
  1986 from 5,908 in 1985, official statistics show.
      However, the ministry sources added it is possible the
  government may make further cuts in response to strong U.S. And
  European demand.
      "Due to concern about the farm trade row with the U.S.,
  Top-level government officials may press the ministry to cut
  the duties," one said.
      But he said it would be difficult for Japan to resolve its
  overall trade row with Washington and reduce its trade surplus,
  which reached 58.6 billion dlrs in 1986.
      Agricultural trade issues between Japan and the U.S.
  Include Japanese import restrictions on 12 farm products.
