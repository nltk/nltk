CZARNIKOW EXPECTS LOWER EUROPEAN SUGAR OUTPUT
  European sugar output on the basis of
  three year average yields will be over half a mln tonnes white
  value down on last year although yields do vary widely from
  year to year, broker C Czarnikow said in its market review.
      European Community sowings are likely to be down compared
  with last year. There have been suggestions these sowings might
  respond to the recent upsurge in world prices, but Czarnikow
  said "it is not the sort of fact that easily becomes known."
      The broker bases its forecasts on Licht planting estimates
  which put W Germany, the Netherlands and USSR lower but
  Hungary, Romania, Poland, Turkey and Yugoslavia higher.
      Czarnikow's projections in mlns tonnes white value and
  three differing yields include
