AMERON &lt;AMN> ADOPTS SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN
  Ameron Inc said its board
  adopted a rights plan designed to protect shareholders from
  potentially unfair takeover tactics.
      The plan calls for distribution of one right for each of
  its outstanding common shares and each right entitles the
  holder to buy one/one-hundredth of a share of newly authorized
  Series A Junior Participating cumulative Preferred stock at an
  exercise price of 55 dlrs, Ameron said.
      It said the rights are exercisable if a group acquires 20
  pct or more of its common stock or announces a tender offer for
  30 pct or more of its shares.
