TOP QUALITIES SOUGHT ON HAMBURG COFFEE MARKET
  The green coffee market saw some demand
  for high quality coffees in the past week, but business was
  described as generally unsatisfactory, trade sources said.
      Especially sought were spot East African and Ethiopian and
  some Brazils, they said, adding that some high grade robustas
  also met some demand.
      Sporadic business was noted in the second hand which
  offered Kenya coffee for May/June shipment up to 25 dlrs below
  origin levels.
      Roasters are said to be well covered and are not expected
  to enter the market for larger purchases in the near term.
