MORE PRESSURE URGED FOR ASIA TO TAKE U.S. BEEF
  Congressmen from beef producing
  states and representatives of the U.S. livestock industry 
  urged the Reagan administration to press Japan and South Korea
  to open up their markets to imports of beef.
      Testifying at a House subcommittee hearing on livestock
  issues, Rep. Hal Daub (R-Nebr.), said the administration should
  push hard for greater beef imports by Japan and South Korea.
  Daub was joined by several other lawmakers.
      U.S. assistant trade representative Suzanne Earley, replied
  "we're not going to let Japan off the hook, or Korea." She
  noted trade representative Clayton Yeutter met with a senior
  Korean official last week on the beef issue, and that Yeutter
  and Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng will visit Tokyo in
  April for discussions on farm trade issues.
      Japan maintains a quota on beef imports, set at 58,400
  tonnes high quality beef in fiscal 1987. South Korea has banned
  beef imports but there are indications Seoul may bow to U.S.
  pressure and allow some imports soon, industry officials said.
      In testimony today, Tom Cook, director of industry affairs
  for the National Cattlemens Association said "the Congress,
  administration and the industry must take a strong, tough and
  united stand to impress the Japanese that we mean business and
  that we expect them to open their markets."
