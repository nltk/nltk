LASER &lt;LSER> SEES IMPACT FROM SUIT ON EARNINGS
  Laser Corp said that costs associated
  with its defense of two shareholder lawsuits could result in a
  net loss for 1987.
      Although Laser expects to post earnings from operations for
  the year, a spokesman said they might be wiped out by legal
  costs, depending on the length of litigation.
      In addition, the company said it will ask shareholders to
  approve proposals to merge the company into its main
  subsidiary, reincorporate in Delaware and change the company's
  name.
