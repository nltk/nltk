INDIA DETAILS RAIN/FLOOD DAMAGE TO GRAIN IN 1986
  Rain and floods in India last year
  damaged about 69,000 tonnes of grain intended for human
  consumption during storage and transportation, food and civil
  supplies minister H. K. L. Bhagat told Parliament.
      He did not give comparative figures and said the
  government-owned Food Corporation of India (FCI) had not yet
  decided whether these grains could be used as cattle feed.
      Bhagat said the FCI had a total of 16.43 mln tonnes of food
  grains in its warehouses at the end of 1986. It had asked state
  governments to build more warehouses to avoid damage to grains.
