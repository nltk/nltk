MIYAZAWA SAYS U.S. LIKELY TO INTERVENE
  Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told
  Parliament's Lower House Finance Committee that the U.S. Is
  expected to intervene in the foreign exchange market to
  stabilise exchange rates, political sources said.
      Asked if the U.S. Federal Reserve Board agreed in Paris
  last month to intervene to stabilise exchange rates, Miyazawa
  said yes, the sources said.
      Miyazawa was also quoted as saying that he is sceptical
  about the effectiveness of currency reference ranges even if
  major nations agree on such an idea as it is extremely
  difficult to set such ranges.
