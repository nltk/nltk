SOVIET UNION FEATURES IN U.K. GRAIN EXPORTS
  The Soviet Union featured prominently in
  U.K. Grain exports outside the EC for the period July 1/March
  13, taking a combined total of 1.10 mln tonnes of wheat and
  barley out of all-destination U.K. Exports of 7.16 mln tonnes,
  the Home Grown Cereals Authority said, quoting provisional
  Customs and Excise figures.
      The Soviet total comprises 634,000 tonnes of wheat and
  472,000 tonnes of barley. Grain traders said the figures
  understate shipments already made by several thousand tonnes
  and they expect total U.K. Grain exports to the USSR this
  season to reach 2.5 mln tonnes, comprising 1.5 mln wheat/1.0
  mln barley.
