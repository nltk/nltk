KANSAS LEGISLATOR TO OFFER U.S. 0/92 BILL TODAY
  U.S. Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan.,
  chairman of the House Agriculture subcommittee on wheat,
  soybeans and feedgrains, said he would today introduce a bill
  to apply the so-called 0/92 concept to wheat and feedgrains
  producers.
      Glickman told Reuters the measure would allow 1987 winter
  wheat producers and 1988 feedgrains producers the possibility
  of receiving no less than 92 pct of their income support
  payments regardless of how much acreage they planted.
      He also said his bill would protect program participants
  from reduced income payments in the event market prices rose
  above the loan rate.
