IVORY COAST MINISTER DELAYED FOR COCOA TALKS
  Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra
  Kanon, chairman of the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO)
  council, will not be able to open the council session here
  tomorrow, an Ivorian ICCO delegate told Reuters.
      He will arrive sometime later during the meetings here, the
  delegate said. The council session will be chaired instead by
  ICCO vice chairman Sir Denis Henry, the delegate from Grenada,
  ICCO officials said.
      Ivorian officials last week said Bra Kanon was due to
  return home for funeral ceremonies for a sister of Ivorian
  President Felix Houphouet-Boigny March 19-22.
