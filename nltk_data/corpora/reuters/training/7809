NO FORCE MAJEURE ON LEAD FROM CAPPER PASS
  U.K. Smelter Capper Pass denied rumours
  that the company had declared, or was about to declare, force
  majeure on lead deliveries.
      This followed trader talk on the London Metal Exchange,
  LME, after broker bids were made at increased premiums for
  Capper Pass brand material.
      Traders said some slight production problems seem to exist
  but are unlikely to have any impact on the market. Lead values
  on the LME today were unchanged around 299 stg per tonne for
  three months delivery after thin business in a one stg range.
