CAESARS WORLD &lt;CAW> BID VALUED AT 907 MLN DLRS
  MTS Acquisition Corp said it will need
  about 907 mln dlrs to acquire the 31,781,461 Caesars World Inc
  shares not owned by its owner, Martin T. Sosnoff.
      The estimate came in MTS Acquisition's proxy statement to
  Caesars World shareholders describing its offer of 28 dlrs a
  share for their stock which was announced this morning.
      In that announcement, MTS Acquisition said its bank and
  investor bankers felt they could provide financing totaling 975
  mln dlrs for the offer.
      Sosnoff is Caesars World's largest shareholders with
  4,217,675 of the company's shares. That is about 11.7 pct of
  the outstanding stock on a fully diluted basis, the proxy said.
      Besides being the sole owner of MTS Acquisition, Sosnoff
  owns 61 pct of Atalanta/Sosnoff Capital Corp's &lt;ATL> stock and
  is chairman of that investment management and brokerage firm.
