ATT &lt;T> CHAIRMAN SAYS DIVIDEND WILL NOT BE CUT
  American Telephone and Telegraph Co does
  not plan to reduce its regular quarterly dividend of 30 cts a
  share on its common stock, said James E. Olson, chairman.
      "It has been the intent to set the dividend at a level so
  that it could be sustained through the ups and downs of the
  business cycle," Olson told a meeting of securities analysts.
      "We see no reason to change that policy," he said.
      Although ATT will maintain its current dividend, Olson said
  the company wants to decrease the percentage of earnings paid
  in dividends by increasing earnings.
      Industry analysts had speculated that ATT might cut its
  common dividend, especially after the company posted a fourth
  quarter net loss of 1.17 billion dlrs and earned only five cts
  a share for the full year.
      The loss included a one-time restructuring charge of 1.7
  billion dlrs.
      Olson said he expects ATT's cash flow to remain strong
  despite the poor earnings.
