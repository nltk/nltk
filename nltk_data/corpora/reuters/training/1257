FRENCH EXPORTERS SEE HIGHER WHEAT SALES TO CHINA
  French exporters estimated that around
  600,000 tonnes of French soft wheat has been sold to China for
  delivery in the 1986/87 (July/June) year.
      Around 300,000 tonnes were exported to China between July
  1986 and February this year.
      Another 100,000 to 150,000 tonnes will be shipped during
  this month and around the same amount in April, they said.
      France sold around 250,000 tonnes of soft wheat to China in
  1985/86, according to customs figures.
      However, certain exporters fear China may renounce part of
  its contract with France after being offered one mln tonnes of
  U.S. soft wheat under the Export Enhancement Program in January
  and making some purchases under the initiative.
