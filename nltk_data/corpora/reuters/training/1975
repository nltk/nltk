TURKEY TO IMPORT 100,000 TONNES OF CRYSTAL SUGAR
  Turkey has announced a tender to import
  100,000 tonnes of white crystal sugar with an advertisement in
  local newspapers.
      Turkish Sugar Factories said in the advertisement there was
  a 50 pct option to increase or decrease the amount and bids
  should reach it before March 24.
      The semi-official Anatolian Agency recently quoted Turkish
  Minister of Industry and Trade Cahit Aral as saying Turkey will
  export 100,000 tonnes of sugar this year and import the same
  amount.
