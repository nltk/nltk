INDIA IN COUNTERTRADE DEAL FOR MALAYSIAN PALM OIL
  India is to partially cover the cost
  of its Malaysian palm oil imports through a countertrade deal
  involving the construction of two bridges valued at 20 mln
  dlrs, an Indian trade source told Reuters.
      He said Malaysia agreed to the oil-for-bridges deal in
  October after India said it could no longer buy some 700,000
  tonnes of palm oil a year because of its trade deficit.
      Malaysia has also agreed to barter palm oil for 30 mln dlrs
  of hydroelectric equipment and is interested in countertrading
  for Indian iron ore, wheat and other goods and services, he
  said.
