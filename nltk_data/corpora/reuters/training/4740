TWO BRAZILIAN SHIPPING FIRMS SETTLE WITH STRIKERS
  Two small shipping companies reached
  a pay deal with striking seamen late yesterday, but union
  leaders said most of Brazil's 40,000 seamen were still on
  strike.
      A union spokesman in Rio de Janeiro said the seamen had
  accepted a 120 pct pay raise offer from the companies, Globo
  and Flumar, which have less than 200 employees each.
      The two-week strike comes as Brazil faces a debt crisis and
  is delaying exports badly needed to earn foreign exchange.
      Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto said the government will
  not force a settlement of the strike, which was ruled illegal
  last Friday.
