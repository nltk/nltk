NEW DUTCH ADVANCES TOTAL 4.8 BILLION GUILDERS
  The Dutch Central Bank said it has
  accepted bids totalling 4.8 billion guilders at tender for new
  seven-day special advances at 5.3 pct covering the period March
  2 to 9 aimed at relieving money market tightness.
      Subscriptions to 300 mln guilders were met in full, amounts
  above 300 mln at 50 pct.
      The new facility replaces old five-day advances worth 8.0
  billion guilders at the same rate.
      Dealers expect this week's money market shortage to be
  around 12 billion guilders.
