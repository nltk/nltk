SINGAPORE EXCHANGE PLANS OPTIONS CONTRACTS
  The Singapore International
  Monetary Exchange Ltd, SIMEX, said it would launch at least two
  options on futures contracts this year.
      SIMEX said in a press release that the options contracts
  would be based on the currency and interest rate futures
  currently traded on the exchange and be started "toward the
  third quarter."
      SIMEX, which is linked to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
  currently trades three currency futures -- on Deutsche marks,
  Japanese yen and British pounds -- and two interest rate
  futures -- on U.S. Treasury-bonds and three-month Eurodollars.
