GUATEMALA TO HOST OTHER MILDS COFFEE MEETING
  Guatemala will host a meeting of other
  milds coffee producers probably in May to discuss basic export
  quotas, the Guatemalan delegate to the International Coffee
  Organization, ICO, said.
      No firm date has been set for the talks, Ambassador Rene
  Montes told reporters at the ICO executive board meeting here.
      Producer countries Brazil, Colombia, and a member of
  OAMCAF, the African and Malagasy Coffee Organization, may also
  be invited for consultation, he said.
      ICO producers and consumers could not agree on how to
  calculate export quota shares at a recent council meeting here.
      Other milds coffee producers include Costa Rica, Dominican
  Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, India,
  Mexico, Nicaragua, Papua New Guinea, and Peru.
