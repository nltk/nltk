(CORRECTED) - PHILIPPINES CRITICISES EC FOR OIL LEVY
  Philippines Trade and
  Industry Secretary Jose Concepcion told world trade ministers
  he wondered if their agreement was of any real value after the
  European Community (EC) proposed a levy on vegetable oils.
      Concepcion, speaking at an informal meeting of the General
  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) here, said ministers
  declared in Uruguay last September that the trade of
  less-developed nations should not be disrupted.
      He said the EC not only ignored Manila's request for lower
  tariffs on coconut oil but proposed a levy on vegetable oils
  and fats that are vital exports for Southeast Asian countries.
      Concepcion said while the levy might be rejected by the EC
  Council of Ministers, he noted that "I cannot help but wonder
  whether the agreements we produce in meetings like this are of
  any real value."
      He also said industrialised nations saved about 65 billion
  U.S. Dlrs in 1985 through low commodity prices, but this had
  affected the ability of developing nations to import goods and
  services.
      "The health and the growth of world trade requires that the
  new development of developing countries losing their share of
  world trade be arrested and reversed," he said.
