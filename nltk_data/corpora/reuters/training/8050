MINORCO &lt;MNRCY> SEES IMPROVED SECOND HALF
  Minorco said it expects net
  earnings to be substantially stronger than the 44.0 mln dlrs
  reported for the first half.
      In reporting that first half results declined from 65.0 mln
  dlrs, Minorco said the contributions from its 50 pct investment
  in December 1985 in Adobe Resources Corp was negative as a
  result of low oil and gas prices.
