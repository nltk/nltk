TAIWAN TO RELAX IMPORT CURBS ON MORE GOODS
  Taiwan will relax import controls on
  more foreign goods, a government spokesman said today.
      The move was to allow greater access to Taiwan markets by
  overseas trading partners, especially the United States, an
  official of the Council for Economic Planning and Development
  told Reuters.
      Import curbs on about 400 foreign goods, including
  stationery and books, would soon be relaxed, he said.
      Taiwan announced it would ease curbs on some 600 farming
  and industrial products last month.
      The official said the moves were intended to balance trade
  between Taiwan and the United States and other trading
  partners. Taiwan's trade surplus reached a record 15.6 billion
  dlrs last year, up from 10.62 billion in 1985.
