TURKISH TRADE DEFICIT WIDENS IN 1986
  Turkey's trade deficit rose to 3.65
  billion dlrs in 1986 from 3.39 billion in 1985 following
  increased imports from Western countries, figures from the
  State Statistics Institute show.
      Exports were down 6.3 pct at 7.45 billion dlrs, compared
  with 7.95 billion in 1985, while imports were down 2.1 pct at
  11.10 billion dlrs from 11.34 billion.
      Total trade with Mid-East Gulf states fell some 40 pct due
  to lower oil prices, with imports at 1.55 billion dlrs,
  compared with 2.74 billion, and exports at 1.65 billion after
  2.72 billion.
      Exports to Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
  Development countries rose to 4.29 billion dlrs from 4.11
  billion in 1985, while imports were 4.56 billion after 3.55
  billion.
      Turkey's trade deficit in December narrowed to 216 mln dlrs
  from 340 mln in November, and compared with 277 mln in December
  1985.
