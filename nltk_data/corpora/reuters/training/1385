JAPAN CUTTING CHINA CORN COMMITMENTS - USDA
  Japanese traders have apparently
  sharply reduced commitments to buy Chinese corn over the next
  six months due to high prices, the U.S. Agriculture Department
  said.
      In its World Production and Trade Report, the department
  said traders indicated China may lack supplies or be unwilling
  to sell at current low world prices.
      If the reports are confirmed, China's major export
  destinations such as USSR, Japan, and South Korea, could
  increase purchases of U.S. corn, it said.
      China is currently forecast to export 5.5 mln tonnes of
  corn during 1986/87 (Oct-Sept), it said.
