U.S. TREASURY'S BAKER SEES EXPANSION CONTINUING
  Treasury Secretary James Baker said
  that the current expansion, which he noted was in its fifth
  year, will continue in the period ahead.
      He told the House Appropriations Committee that "there is
  every prospect that the current expansion will continue
  unabated through 1987 and the years beyond."
      Baker said interest rates over the period have continued to
  decline and that "policies of the Federal Reserve assure that
  ample credit was available.
      He said that the administration's longer term forecast
  envisioned that "we will maintain and improve upon our progress
  in bringing down the rate of inflation."
