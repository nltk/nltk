NORTHEAST, EASTERN THAILAND FACE SEVERE DROUGHT
  Thirteen provinces, mainly in northeast
  and eastern Thailand, have been suffering a worse than average
  drought since mid-February and the dry spell is expected to
  last until early May, Deputy Interior Minister Santi
  Chaiviratana said.
      Santi told reporters the government is launching a drought
  relief operation mainly involving the use of water trucks to
  send water to affected farming areas.
      He did not say what crops have been damaged in northeast
  Thailand but said large durian orchards in eastern Chanthaburi
  province have suffered heavy losses.
      The Minister said the affected areas include eight
  provinces in the northeast, two in eastern Thailand and three
  rubber growing provinces in the south near the Malaysian
  border.
