COFFEE QUOTA TALKS CONTINUE, NO ACCORD SEEN LIKELY
  The International Coffee Organization
  (ICO ) council talks on reintroducing export quotas continued
  with an extended session lasting late into Sunday night, but
  delegates said prospects for an accord between producers and
  consumers were diminishing by the minute.
      The special meeting, called to stop the prolonged slide in
  coffee prices, was likely to adjourn sometime tonight without
  agreement, delegates said.
      The council is expected to agree to reconvene either within
  the next six weeks or in September, they said.
      The talks foundered on Sunday afternoon when it became
  apparent consumers and producers could not compromise on the
  formula for calculating any future quota system, delegates
  said.
      Coffee export quotas were suspended a year ago when prices
  soared in response to a drought which cut Brazil's crop by
  nearly two-thirds. Brazil is the world's largest coffee
  producer and exporter.
