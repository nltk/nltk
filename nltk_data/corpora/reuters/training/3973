SENATOR LUGAR CALLS FOR CARGO PREFERENCE REPEAL
  The senior Republican on the U.S.
  Senate Agriculture Committee, Richard Lugar of Indiana, called
  for repeal of the cargo preference law that aids the American
  shipping industry but which he said hurts farmers.
      "Cargo preference is a costly special interest operated at
  the expense of American farmers and dockworkers," Lugar said in
  signing on as a co-sponsor or cargo preference repeal
  legislation.
      The law requires shipment of U.S. goods on American ships
  rather than foreign vessels which are less costly.
