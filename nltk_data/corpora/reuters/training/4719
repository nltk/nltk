BURMESE PADDY PRODUCTION LOWER IN 1986/87
  Burma's paddy production fell to 729.4
  mln baskets in fiscal year 1986-1987 (to end March) from 737.3
  mln in 1985-1986, a cabinet report to parliament said.
      A basket is a local measure equal to 46 lbs.
      Paddy output in 1984-1985 was 699.1 mln baskets, it said.
      Burma's "Green Revolution" sparked by the introduction of
  high-yield variety paddy strains in the mid-1970s appears to
  have hit a plateau with production levelling off over the past
  two years, economists said.
