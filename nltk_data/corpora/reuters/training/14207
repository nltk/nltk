DUTCH MONEY MARKET DEBT RISES IN WEEK
  Loans and advances from the Dutch
  Central Bank to the commercial banks rose by 1.2 billion
  guilders to 10.7 billion in the week up to and including April
  6, the Bank's weekly return showed.
      Paper discounted with the Bank also rose, by 477 mln
  guilders to 916 mln.
      These rises were balanced by a 1.6 billion guilders rise in
  the Treasury's account at the Bank, made up mainly of
  repayments on housing loans by local authorities.  The
  Treasury's account stood at 8.1 billion guilders, the weekly
  return showed.
      The Bank's gold and currency reserves rose by 484 mln to
  56.89 billion guilders, while the value of non-gold holdings
  rose by 140 mln guilders, analysts said.
      They added that the rise in the reserves was merely the
  result of commercial currency transactions by the Bank.
      Call money and period tariffs were only fractionally
  changed this week and were seen sustaining their stable levels
  since no dramatic changes in the money market debt, currently
  around 10.25 billion guilders, are expected.
      Today call money traded between 5-3/8 to 5-1/2 pct and
  period tariffs all between 5-5/16 to 5-7/16 pct.
