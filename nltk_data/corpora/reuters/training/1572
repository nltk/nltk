GOODYEAR TIRE &lt;GT> DETAILS 1986 TAX REFUND
  Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co said its
  1986 results include a tax refund of 75.7 mln dlrs from the
  costs of restructuring the company in a successful defense
  against a takeover attempt by James Goldsmith.
      Chairman Robert Mercer said, "Heavy restructuring costs
  related to the takeover attempt combined with government tax
  incentives for investments ... resulted in this federal tax
  refund."
      The refund was included but not broken out in its initial
  1986 results, a spokesman said. It reported 1986 net income of
  124.1 mln dlrs against 412.4 mln dlrs a year earlier.
