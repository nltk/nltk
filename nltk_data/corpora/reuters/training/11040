USDA TO UPDATE WINTER WHEAT ACREAGE TOMORROW
  The U.S. Agriculture Department said
  it will update its estimate of winter wheat seeded acreage in
  the prospective planting report, scheduled for release at 1500
  est (2100 gmt) tomorrow, March 31.
      The original estimate of seedings of winter wheat was
  published in January.
      It said the new survey is possible because of the new
  integrated nationwide survey program that uses probability
  sampling procedures that combine information from farmers
  operating in selected areas and farmers identified on special
  lists.
