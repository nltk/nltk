GERMAN RETAILERS EXPECT GOOD 1987
  West German retailers expect another good
  year in 1987 even though they will not be able to repeat the
  sharp increase in turnover they enjoyed in 1986, the General
  Association of the German Retail Trade (HDE) said.
      HDE President Wolfgang Hinrichs said retailers would be
  satisfied with a real turnover increase of between 2.5 pct to
  three pct in 1987 after last year's steep 3.7 pct rise.
      Hinrichs said the 1986 turnover increase had brought the
  first hesitant signs of improvement in earnings in the West
  German retail sector.
