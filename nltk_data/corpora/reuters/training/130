COLECO INDUSTRIES &lt;CLC> SEES PROFIT IN 1987
  Coleco Industries Inc said
  it expects to return to profitability in 1987.
      Earlier, Coleco reported a net loss of 111.2 mln dlrs for
  the year ended December 31 compared to a profit of 64.2 mln
  dlrs in the year earlier.
      In a prepared statement, the company said the dramatic
  swing in operating results was due primarily to the steep
  decline in sales of Cabbage Patch Kids products from 600 mln
  dlrs to 230 mln dlrs.
      Coleco said it changed from a single product company to a
  more diversified organization through four major acquisitions
  last year.
      Products from the new acquisitions and other new product
  introductions are expected to enable it to return to
  profitability, it said.
      At the annual Toy Fair earlier this month, vice president
  Morton Handel said analysts' 1987 projected earnings of 90 cts
  a share on sales of 600 mln dlrs are reasonable.
