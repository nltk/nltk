GERMAN INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT RISES 3.2 PCT IN FEBRUARY
  West German industrial production,
  seasonally adjusted, rose a provisional 3.2 pct in February
  after a downwards revised decline of 3.4 pct in January, the
  Economics Ministry said.
      The ministry had originally estimated that industrial
  production fell 3.0 pct in January.
      The February figure is likely to be revised upwards by just
  under one percentage point next month when the March figure is
  released, a ministry statement said.
      The industrial production index, base 1980, stood at a
  provisional 104.1 in February against 100.9 in January and
  104.5 in December. The ministry had previously put the January
  and December indices at 101.6 and 104.7 respectively.
      In February 1986 the output index had stood at 103.7,
  producing a year-on-year rise for February 1987 of 0.4 pct.
      The February rise in production was aided by a sharp 19 pct
  increase in construction output compared with January, when
  production in many industrial sectors was depressed by
  unusually severe winter weather.
      Manufacturing industry registered a 3-1/2 pct rise in
  production in February compared with January. But energy sector
  output fell nine pct and mining production declined seven pct.
      The ministry, which considers two-monthly comparisons to be
  a better guide to trends, said output in January and February
  together fell around two pct against November and December.
      The ministry said construction output fell 13-1/2 pct in
  January/February against November/December due to the cold
  January weather. Output in the energy sector rose four pct and
  mining output 10 pct.
      Manufacturing industry's production fell 1-1/2 pct in
  January/February compared with November/December.
      Within this sector, the output of both basic products and
  of food, tobacco and alcohol fell 1-1/2 pct. Production of
  capital goods fell 2-1/2 pct while output of consumer goods was
  unchanged.
