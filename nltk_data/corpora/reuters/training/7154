USDA ASKS TIGHT INSECT RULES FOR GRAIN SHIPMENTS
  The U.S. Agriculture Department is
  proposing tighter federal standards setting allowable limits on
  insect infestations in grain shipments.
      The changes in the standards would include the following:
      -- Establishing equal tolerances for the number of live
  insects in shipments of food grains, feed grains and oilseeds.
      -- Revising the definition of "infested" to give equal value
  to all insects injurious to grain.
      -- Establishing lower levels of infestations. In 1988, the
  infested level would be set at three or more live insects per
  representative sample (about 100 grams), in 1990 two or more
  insects, and in 1992 the final infestattion level would be set
  at one or more live insects per representative sample.
      -- Revising the definition of sample grade by adding a
  limit of 10 live or dead insects per sample.
      -- Revising the definition of sample grade for wheat by
  adding a limit of 32 insect-damaged kernels per 100 grams of
  wheat.
      The department asked for public comments on the proposals
  by April 17.
