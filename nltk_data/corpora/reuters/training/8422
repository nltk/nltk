TIMBER REALIZATION &lt;TRX> TO SELL REMAINING ACRES
  Timber Realization Co said it has
  agreed to sell its remaining 50,000 acres of timberland
  property in Mississippi for about 11.3 mln dlrs in cash.
      Timber Realization, a limited partnership formed to dispose
  of timberlands and related properties transferred to it by the
  &lt;Masonite Corp>, said that when this sale is completed the
  partnership will have received about 15.2 mln dlrs in cash and
  notes from the sale of its properties since December 23, 1986.
      The partnership said it will terminate before August 3,
  1987.
      Prior to that date, the partnership said it expects to form
  a liquidating trust to provide for unresolved claims and
  liablities.
      Timber Realization said the amount retained in that trust
  will depend on its experience in resolving open items up to the
  termination date, but it added it expects to retain a
  substantial amount in the trust.
      The partnership said it anticipates making a cash
  distribution of an as yet undetermined amount to unitholders at
  or before the liquidation trust's funding date.
