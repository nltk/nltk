NEW CHIEF ELECTED FOR WORLD SUGAR ORGANISATION
  Dominican Alfredo Ricart will take over
  as executive director of the International Sugar Organization
  (ISO) in mid-April, ISO officer in charge Constantin Politoff
  said.
      Previous ISO chief William Miller retired at end-February
  last year.
      Ricart told Reuters his first aim is put the "house in order"
  by having a new administrative sugar pact with improved
  allocations of voting rights and financial contributions.
      Once this is done, time can be dedicated to working towards
  a new International Sugar Agreement (ISA) with economic
  clauses, he said.
      Ricart, currently the Dominican Republic's ambassador to
  Austria, the Netherlands and the UN in Geneva, said he will
  visit the four major exporters - Australia, Brazil, Cuba and
  the European Community - to talk to governments and producers
  and find out about problems that are preventing these countries
  finding common ground for a new sugar pact.
