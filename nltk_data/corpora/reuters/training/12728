COOPER BASIN NATURAL GAS RESERVES UPGRADED
  Remaining recoverable gas reserves in
  the areas held by the Santos Ltd &lt;STOS.S>-led Cooper Basin
  joint ventures have been upgraded to 2,721.7 billion cubic feet
  (bcf) from the 2,466 estimated last May, Santos said.
      The upgrading followed a re-review by consultant &lt;Coles
  Nikiforuk Pennell Associates> in light of the large number of
  gas finds since May 1986, Santos said in a statement.
      This means that total contractual commitments of 2,455.5
  bcf to &lt;The Australian Gas Light Co> of New South Wales and the
  Pipeline Authority of South Australia can be met with spare gas
  available for sale in South Australia, it said.
