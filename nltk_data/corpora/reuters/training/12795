JAPAN ASKS BANKS TO CUT DOLLAR SALES - DEALERS
  The Finance Ministry has asked Japanese
  commercial banks to moderate their dollar sales, bank dealers
  said.
      They said the Ministry had telephoned city and long-term
  banks earlier this week to make the request.
      One dealer said this was the first time the Ministry had
  made such a request to commercial banks.
      Finance Ministry officials were unavailable for immediate
  comment. Dealers said the Ministry has already asked
  institutional investors to reduce their sales of the dollar.
