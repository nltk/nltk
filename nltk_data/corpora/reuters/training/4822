  The Bank of England said it gave the
  money market late, unspecified assistance of around 185 mln

  estimated at around one billion stg.
      Overnight interbank sterling dipped to 10 nine pct after
  the bank's announcement compared with levels around 10-1/2 pct
  shortly before and 11-1/4 11 pct initially today, dealers said.
