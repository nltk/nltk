CHEMLAWN &lt;CHEM> SEEKS BIDS BY MARCH 18
  ChemLawn corp said it has asked
  potential purchasers of the company to submit their proposals
  by 1700 EST on March 18.
      ChemLawn said if Waste Management Inc &lt;WMX> intends to
  participate in the bidding process, it will have to submit a
  confidentiality agreement to Chemlawn financial advisor Smith
  Barney, Harris Upham and Co Inc.
      Waste Management has a 27 dlr per share tender offer for
  Chemlawn underway that Chemlawn has already rejected as
  inadequate.
      Chemlawn has already said it is holding talks with various
  parties on the sale of the company and said it has informed all
  potential purchasers that they mnust sign confidentiality
  agreemnents to receive confidential information on Chemlawn.
      ChemLawn said if Waste Management were to sign such an
  agreement, ChemLawn would supply it with the same information
  being supplied to other potential purchasers. But it said it
  will not make an exception for Waste Management which would
  give that company an advantage in the bidding process.
