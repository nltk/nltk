TREASURY SAYS ONLY REAGAN, BAKER SPEAK ON DLR
  The U.S. Treasury repeated a White
  House statement that only President Reagan and Treasury
  Secretary James Baker are authorized to speak on the dollar.
      A Department spokesman was commenting on remarks by
  Commerce Department Under-Secretary Robert Ortner that the yen
  was undervalued 10 or 15 pct against the dollar but European
  currencies were fairly priced against the U.S. currency.
      "As Larry Speakes said on January 14 this year, only two
  people in this administration are authorized to speak on the
  dollar and that is the president and the secretary of the
  treasury," the spokesman told Reuters.
