MORE INTERMEDIATE U.S. WHEAT CREDITS FOR MOROCCO
  The Commodity Credit Corporation has
  approved an additional 45.0 mln dlrs under its interemdiate
  export credit guarantee program, GSM-103, for sales of U.S.
  wheat to Morocco, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
      The action increases Morocco's cumulative fiscal year 1987
  program for wheat under GSM-103 to 75.0 mln dlrs.
      The credit terms extended for exports under the program
  must be in excess of three years but no more than seven years
  to eligible for credit coverage. All sales under this line must
  be registered and exported by September 30, 1987.
      The department also said the guarantee line for sales of
  U.S. wheat under the Export Credit Guarantee Program, GSM-102,
  has been decreased 45.0 mln dlrs to 60.0 mln.
