BRITISH MINISTER CRITICISES PROPOSED EC OILS TAX
  A British minister said that a proposed
  European Community tax on vegetable oils and fats would raise
  the price of fish and chips and he pledged the government would
  fight against it.
      Lord Belstead, a junior agriculture minister, told the
  House of Lords the tax would raise the price of raw materials
  used in many processed foods by about 100 pct.
      He said revenue should not be raised by taxing the consumer
  and called the proposal "repugnant."
