INDONESIA'S NON-OIL EXPORTS DECLINE IN 1986
  Indonesia's non-oil and gas exports
  fell to 5.79 billion dlrs in calendar 1986 from 5.98 billion in
  1985, according to Bank Indonesia figures.
      Coffee exports rose to 753 mln dlrs from 580 mln in 1985,
  but rubber shipments fell to 625 mln from 720 mln and tin to
  180.6 mln from 246 mln, weekly central bank figures show.
      Indonesia hopes to boost its non-oil exports to make up for
  oil revenue lost because of lower prices. But the lower value
  of commodities such as timber, rubber, palm oil and tea on
  world markets has prevented this, despite a 31 pct devaluation
  of the rupiah against the dollar in September.
