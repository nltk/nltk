PUROLATOR &lt;PCC> DIRECTOR QUITS OVER BUYOUT
  A Purolator Courier Corp director
  resigned from the company's board, saying he plans to take
  steps to make or find an offer that tops the 265 mln dlr buyout
  deal already accepted by Purolator's board, the company said.
      The director, Doresy Gardner, resigned in a March 10 letter
  to the Purolator board, which was included in a filing made by
  the company to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
      Gardner noted that the terms of the merger agreement in
  which the company would bought out by a group of its managers
  and E.F. Hutton LBO Inc bar directors from taking action to
  solicit, initiate or encourage acquisition proposals.
      "I, as a shareholder, wish to solicit, initiate or
  encourage such an offer or indication of interest, and believe,
  therefore, that I should resign as a director of the
  corporation," Gardner said in the letter.
      "Accordingly, I hereby resign as a director of Purolator
  Courier Corp, effective immediately," he said.
      Gardner said he believes shareholders could get a better
  deal than the buyout offer if the company would agree to be
  sold to some other entity, or if it could sell off all or part
  of its U.S. courier division.
      On March 4, another Purolator shareholder, Rodney Shields,
  filed a class action suit on behalf of the company's
  shareholders charging the company and its board with breaching
  their fiduciary duty by failing to take steps to ensure that
  shareholders got the highest possible price in the buyout.
      The deal would give shareholders 35 dlrs a share in cash if
  just 83 pct of Purolator's 7.6 mln shares are tendered. If more
  are tendered, they would receive 29 dlrs in cash and six dlrs
  in debentures and a warrant to buy stock in the new company in
  exchange for each share.
