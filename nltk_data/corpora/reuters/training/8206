NEW RUBBER PACT ADOPTED AT GENEVA CONFERENCE
  Producers and consumers representing
  most of world trade in natural rubber adopted a new
  International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) aimed at
  stabilizing world prices over the next five years.
      Negotiations for a new INRA, to succeed the present one
  which runs out next October, began nearly two years ago.
      Agreement on the new five-year pact, which uses a buffer
  stock to keep prices stable by selling or buying rubber as
  rates rise or fall, was reached at a two-week session here
  under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade
  and Development (UNCTAD).
