WEYERHAEUSER &lt;WY> SEES HIGHER 1987 EARNINGS
  Weyerhaeuser Co said it should
  have significant increases in earnings in 1987 and 1988 should
  be another very good year.
      Weyerhaeuser reported 1986 earnings of 276.7 mln dlrs, or
  1.91 dlrs per share, on 5.65 billion dlrs in revenues.
      Anticipated improved cash flows will allow the company to
  invest and acquire much more aggressively than it has in the
  past few years, Weyerhaeuser also said.
      Weyerhaeuser, principally a lumber products company, said
  the forecast was made by the company's chief financial officer
  during a meeting of institutional investors in Tokyo.
      It also said its expects to see opportunities in the
  building products area, particularly in composite panels and in
  other engineered products directed toward specific, rather than
  commodity, end-use markets.
      But it said growth may be higher in added-value products,
  in financial services and in other diversified businesses.
      In addition, the company said rising product prices and
  demand for pulp and paper are reflected in all the major world
  markets, except in the case of some light-weighted paper grades
  where overcapacity remains a problem.
      Weyerhaeuser further stated that it has lowered its
  manufacturing cost structure and is obtaining significant
  productivity increases.
