FED EXPECTED TO ADD RESERVES
  The Federal Reserve is expected to
  enter the U.S. government securities market to add reserves
  during its usual intervention period today, economists said.
      With federal funds trading at a steady 6-3/16 pct, most
  economists expect an indirect injection of temporary reserves
  via a medium-sized round of customer repurchase agreements.
      However, some economists said the Fed may arrange more
  aggressive system repurchase agreements.
      Economists would also not rule out an outright bill pass
  early this afternoon. Such action had been widely anticipated
  yesterday but failed to materialize.
