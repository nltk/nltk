EC MINISTER SEES OILS TAX STILL IN NEGOTIATION
  The outcome of negotiations on
  proposals by the European Commission for a 330 Ecus a tonne tax
  on EC-produced and imported oilseeds and marine oils remains
  difficult to predict, Belgian agriculture minister Paul de
  Keersmaeker told a news conference.
      De Keersmaeker, who chaired a meeting of EC farm ministers
  which ended today, was asked about reports enough countries
  were against the tax to ensure that it would be defeated in
  negotiations on the EC farm price package for 1987/88.
      He said it was true some countries were strongly opposed,
  but others were less so and others basically in favour.
      "I think there is room for negotiations, and I would not
  want to make any predictions at this stage," de Keersmaeker
  said.
      Yesterday, British minister Michael Jopling said Britain,
  West Germany, Portugal, the Netherlands and Denmark were
  opposed to the measure. Between them these countries have more
  than enough voting power to block it.
      Diplomatic sources said at today's meeting the Spanish
  delegation also expressed strong reservations about the idea.
