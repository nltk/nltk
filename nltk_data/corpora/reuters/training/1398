PORK CHECKOFF REFUNDS LESS THAN EXPECTED
  The National Pork Board announced at the
  American Pork Congress convention in Indianapolis that refunds
  under the legislative checkoff program are running less than
  expected.
      The Board oversees collection and distribution of funds
  from the checkoff program that was mandated by the 1985 farm
  bill. Virgil Rosendale, a pork producer from Illinois and
  chairman of the National Pork Board, said over 2.2 mln dlrs was
  collected in January and refunds are running almost nine pct,
  considerably less than expected.
      "We believe that this indicates good producer support for
  the new checkoff. We're getting good compliance from markets,
  from packers and from dealers," Rosendale said.
