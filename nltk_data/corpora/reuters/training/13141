NETWORK &lt;NETW> TO TAKE 3RD QTR CHARGE
  Network Control Corp said it
  intends to take a 250,000 dlr charge against earnings for the
  third quarter ended March 31 and said sales for the quarter
  would be about 400,000 dlrs, about 50 pct below sales in the
  same year-ago quarter.
      Network said it is taking the charge due to the significant
  increase in accounts receivable which remain uncollected for
  more than 90 days after billing. It said it ultimately will
  collect most of those accounts.
      It attributed the sales decline to a transition period for
  its new products and a delay in a major order.
