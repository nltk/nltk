U.K. MONEY MARKET DEFICIT FORECAST AT 350 MLN STG
  The Bank of England said it forecast a
  shortage of around 350 mln stg in the money market today.
      Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing
  in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain
  some 525 mln stg while bankers' balnces below target will take
  out around 175 mln stg.
      Partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions
  and a fall in note circulation will add some 300 mln stg and 40
  mln stg to the system respectively.
