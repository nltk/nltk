HRE PROPERTIES &lt;HRE> CUTS QUARTERLY
  HRE Properties said its board cut the
  quarterly dividend to 45 cts per share from 57 cts, payable
  April 20 to holders of record March 31.
      HRE said the board reduced the dividend due to the
  continuing impact of overbuilding in its office building
  markets and its inability to replace the income from high
  yielding investments that have matured.
      HRE said in the first quarter ended January 31 it earned 38
  cts per share, down from 47 cts a year before.
