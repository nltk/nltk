UAL &lt;UAL> SAID TRUMP TALKED WITH UAL CHAIRMAN
  Real estate magnate Donald Trump told
  UAL Inc Chairman Richard Ferris that he was interested in UAL

      Trump, who was unavailable for comment, is believed by
  market sources to have a sizeable position in UAL, which he
  began accumulating several weeks ago. UAL stock today was up
  three at 63 in active trading.
      "They (ferris and Trump) talked last week. Apparently,
  Trump said he was interested in it as an investment. He didn't
  say how much stock he had. He didn't say what he would or
  wouldn't do about it," said UAL senior vice president Kurt
  Stocker.
      Trump is believed to have close to five pct of UAL's stock,
  market sources said.
