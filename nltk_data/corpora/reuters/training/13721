HOUSEHOLD INT'L &lt;HI> PROJECTS EARNINGS RISE
  Household International
  Inc said it expects its fully diluted earnings per share for
  the first quarter to be about 35 pct above the same year-ago
  period.
      It also looks for 1987 full-year fully diluted earnings to
  be about 20 pct higher than the record 4.31 dlrs a share
  reported for 1986.
      Chairman Donald Clark, in remarks prepared for delivery to
  New York security analysts, cited increased earnings from
  Household Financial Services and "excellent return on equity
  from Household Manufacturing, combined with the impact of our
  share repurchase program, will result in higher earnings per
  share and improved return on equity in 1987."
