ICO QUOTA TALKS FAILURE PARALYSE HAMBURG MARKET
  The failure of International Coffee
  Organization talks on the reintroduction of quotas has
  paralysed business on the Hamburg green coffee market in the
  past week, trade sources said.
      There was only sporadic activity for spot material, which
  was mainly requirement buying, they said, adding that
  pre-registered coffees were no longer available.
      They said they expected Brazil and Colombia to open export
  registrations for May shipment next week. However, the
  president of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, Jorio Dauster,
  said yesterday he had not yet decided when its registrations
  would reopen.
