SOVIET GRAIN PRODUCTS MINISTRY CRITICISED
  The Soviet Communist Party has criticised
  the country's Grain Products Ministry for failing to ensure
  proper grain storage, turning out poor quality bread and for
  unsatisfactory book keeping, Pravda said.
      The party daily said that losses in the industry owing to
  waste and theft amounted to 7.3 mln roubles over the last two
  and a half years.
      The situation was particularly bad in the Central Asian
  republic of Kazakhstan, which has been severely criticised
  since the ousting of its veteran leader Dinmukhamed Kunayev
  last December.
      Its new leader, Gennady Kolbin, has said that at times the
  grain-growing republic has performed so badly that it has been
  obliged to seek grain supplies from national reserves.
      Tass news agency announced yesterday that Grain Products
  Minister Grigory Zolotukhin, 75, was being retired and replaced
  by Alexander Budyka, a senior food industry official.
      Pravda added today that the crisis in the industry had been
  drawn to Zolotukhin's attention and two of his deputies
  reprimanded.
