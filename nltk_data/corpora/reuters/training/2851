USDA TO CONDUCT SURVEY FOR AVIAN INFLUENZA
  U.S. Agriculture Department animal
  health officials are conducting a national survey of live-bird
  markets and auctions to check for signs of avian influenza, an
  infectious viral disease of poultry, the department said.
      The survey will locate poultry dealers and live-bird
  markets that sell live birds directly to the consumer and once
  the dealers and markets are identified, there will be tests to
  determine any past or present exposure to avian influenza
  viruses, it said.
      In 1983-84, an outbreak of avian influenza in Pennsylvania,
  Maryland, Virginia and New Jersey cost taxpayers 65 mln dlrs to
  control and required the destruction of more than 17 mln birds,
  it said.
      The survey is expected to be completed by April 15.
