USSR TO CUT COAL PRICE FOR JAPANESE STEELMILLS
  The Soviet Union has agreed to cut its
  coking coal export prices to Japanese steel mills by about five
  dlrs a tonne in 1987/88 starting April 1 in exchange for an
  increase in export volume, industry sources said.
      The prices were set at 44 dlrs a tonne for Neryungrinsky
  coal and at 43.80 dlrs for Kuznetsky coal, fob.
      Japan will import a total of 4.9 mln tonnes from both
  areas, up from 4.2 mln a year earlier, they said.
      The steelmakers had asked Moscow to agree to a cutback to
  3.7 mln tonnes in 1987/88, but the Soviet Union urged Japan to
  increase the amount to 6.5 mln, they said.
