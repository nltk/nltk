CREDIT AGRICOLE REPLACES BNP IN HACHETTE TV BID
  French state agricultural bank &lt;Caisse
  Nationale du Credit Agricole> has joined the group led by
  publishing house &lt;Hachette> which is bidding for control of the
  state television station TF1, replacing &lt;Banque Nationale de
  Paris> which has withdrawn, Hachette said in a statement.
      Credit Agricole's stake in the consortium will be 3.5 pct.
      Last week the broadcasting supervisory board asked Hachette
  to remove BNP from the consortium because the bank had acted as
  adviser to the government for the imminent privatisation of
  TF1.
