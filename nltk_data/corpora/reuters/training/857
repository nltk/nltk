CANADIAN SEAFARERS THREATEN STRIKE
  Canadian seafarers are almost certain
  to go on strike this spring in a refusal to meet rollbacks in
  wages and benefits asked for by their employers, Seafarers'
  International Union official Roman Gralewicz said.
      "It's 99.9 percent--I guarantee you a strike," Gralewicz
  said in an interview.
      The union represents about 2,300 workers on the Great Lakes
  and Canada's East and West coasts. Contract talks broke off in
  January and a conciliator has been appointed to try to help
  settle the dispute. The current contract expires at the end of
  March.
      The seafarers' employers are also asking for a reduction in
  crew levels, a move which the union said would cost about 400
  jobs.
