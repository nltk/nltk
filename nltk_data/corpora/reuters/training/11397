ENVOY ADVISES NAKASONE TO PREPARE FOR U.S. VISIT
  The Japanese ambassador to the U.S.
  Suggested that Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone make efforts to
  present "advanced' proposals on trade issues when he visits
  Washington next month.
      Ambassador Nobuo Matsunaga made the recommendation at a
  meeting with Nakasone, Kyodo News Service said.
      Matsunaga also advised that the prime minister should be
  prepared to discuss U.S.-Japan economic issues.
      Matsunaga cited issues such as a U.S.-Japan micro chip
  trade pact, foreign access to the Kansai international airport
  project, and a new international telecommunications firm.
      Matsunaga returned on Sunday to report to Japanese leaders
  on recent U.S. Developments over trade, in preparation for
  Nakasone's visit to Washington, April 29 to May 5.
      Kyodo quoted Nakasone as telling reporters after meeting
  the envoy, "I entirely accept what ambassador Matsunaga
  recommended." Nakasone did not elaborate.
      The U.S.-Japan trade dispute intensified last week when
  President Ronald Reagan said the U.S. Would impose heavy
  tariffs on Japanese imports in retaliation against alleged
  Japanese breach of the computer chip trade pact.
      Meanwhile, Nakasone's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)
  is to consider measures to boost imports and open up the
  Japanese market, such as government purchase of supercomputers
  and expanding foreign access to the Kansai airport project,
  party sources said.
      The LDP international economic affairs council was
  responding to Nakasone's request for measures to reduce Japan's
  increasing trade surpluses with the U.S. And Europe, they said.
