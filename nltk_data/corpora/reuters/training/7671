SONEX RESEARCH &lt;SONX> CUSTOM AUTO USES MORE GAS
  Sonex Research Inc said its
  modified 1986 British Ford Escort passed the European emissions
  test, but reported the engine consumed 35 pct more fuel than
  the stock engine.
      Sonex said its engine is not equipped with a catalytic
  converter and does not use exhaust gas recirculation or an
  emission air pump. It said the company expected to realize a
  reduced fuel economy, but is working on improving fuel
  consumption.
      The company said after it installs the new fuel system, it
  will retest the automobile.
      In a separate announcement, the company said it received
  confirmation from the European Patent Office that Sonex
  successfully defended its BETA European Patent from a
  competitor.
