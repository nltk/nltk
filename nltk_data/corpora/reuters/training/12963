CAMPBELL'S &lt;CCH> MESTON LAKE SETS GOLD TARGETS
  &lt;Meston Lake Resources Inc>, 65.3 pct
  owned by Campbell Resources Inc, said it will begin commercial
  output at its Joe Mann mine in the Chibougamu area of Quebec at
  an initial daily rate of 500 short tons of ore grading 0.15
  ounce of gold per ton.
      It said it will improve throughput to 700 tons a day at
  0.221 ounce of gold per ton.
      Meston said current ore reserves at the property total
  910,000 tons grading 0.211 ounces of gold per ton and 0.3 pct
  copper, but it may be able to develop "substantially greater
  tonnage."
    
      Meston said underground drilling below current developed
  reserves has intersected the main zone 200 feet below the
  bottom level, with the average grade assayed at 0.530 ounce of
  gold per ton over true width of 17 feet.
      A recent drillhole, east of the current shaft and 600 feet
  from the reserve boundary, intersected three zones grading,
  respectively, 0.708 ounce per ton over 5.4 feet at depth of 650
  feet, 0.706 ounce over seven feet at depth of 765 feet and
  0.418 ounce over one foot at depth of 1,000 feet. A second
  surface hole, 500 feet farther east, intersected 1.068 ounce
  per ton over 5.3 feet.
