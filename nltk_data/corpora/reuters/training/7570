GERMAN VEBA PLACEMENT SAID LIKELY EARLY NEXT WEEK
  The placement of the German federal
  government's 25.6 pct stake in utility Veba AG &lt;VEBG.F> would
  probably take place early next week, banking sources said.
      Share dealers said speculation had arisen in the early
  pre-bourse market that the Veba announcement could come as
  early as today. But one banking source, though confirming that
  most of the details had been worked out, said the chances of an
  announcement today were about nil. He had no price details.
      The 10 mln shares on offer are expected to bring a cash
  call in Germany for well over two billion marks. The share was
  around 253 marks today after a 6.50 drop to 252 yesterday.
