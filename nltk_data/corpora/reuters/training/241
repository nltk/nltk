CHINESE WHEAT CROP THREATENED BY PESTS, DISEASE
  China's wheat crop this year is seriously
  threatened by plant pests and diseases, the New China News
  Agency said.
      More than 5 mln hectares of wheat-producing land in North
  China could be affected because relatively warm and dry weather
  had allowed bacteria and insect eggs to survive the winter, the
  agency added.
      China"s Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and
  Fisheries has called for measures including the timely supply
  of pesticides to farmers to combat the threat, it said.
