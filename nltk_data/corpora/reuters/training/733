ROSPATCH &lt;RPCH> REJECTS DIAGNOSTIC &lt;DRS> BID
  Rospatch Corp said it
  rejected a proposal by Diagnostic Retrieval Systems Inc to
  acquire its stock at 22 dlrs a share.
      Rospatch's board believes that the long term interests of
  its shareholders will be best served by continuing as an
  independent public company at this time, the company said in
  response to an unsolicited offer from Diagnostic Retrieval.
      Rospatch said Diagnostic's offer of February 27 is a
  variation of a previous offer in January, the nature of which
  was not disclosed.
      Rospatch said it advised Diagnostic Retrieval that "it
  would be contrary to the best interests of the corporation
  to engage in any discussions concerning a business combination
  with Diagnostic Retrieval."
