TAIWAN ISSUES MORE CDS TO CURB MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH
  The central bank has issued 7.08 billion
  dlrs worth of certificates of deposit (CDs), bringing the value
  of CD issues so far this year to 93.29 billion, a bank
  spokesman told Reuters.
      The new CDs, with maturities of six months, one year and
  two years, carry interest rates ranging from 3.9 to 5.15 pct.
      The issues are designed to help curb the growth of the M-1B
  money supply which has expanded along with Taiwan's foreign
  exchange reserves, the spokesman said. The reserves reached a
  record high of more than 51 billion U.S. Dlrs Wednesday.
