HANSON &lt;HAN> UNIT TO SELL KAISER TERMINAL/PLANT
  Hanson Industries, the U.S. arm of
  Hanson Trust PLC &lt;HAN>, said it has proposed to sell, in
  separate transactions, Kaiser Cement's Northwest Terminals and
  Montana City plant, to Lone Star Industries Inc &lt;LCE> and &lt;Ash
  Grove Cement West Inc>, respectively for a total of 50.2
  mln dlrs.
      Hanson said the deals are subject to normal conditions of
  closing.
      Hanson Industries completed the purchase of Kaiser Cement
  on March 3, for about 250 mln dlrs.
      Hanson said Kaiser Cement is now an indirect wholly owned
  unit of Hanson Trust and forms part of its building products
  group.
      "These sales are a continuation of an asset redeployment
  program at Kaiser Cement and will allow Kaiser to concentrate
  its efforts in the California marketplace, where it is the
  largest cement producer and holds a premiere market position,"
  Hanson Industries chairman Gordon White said.
