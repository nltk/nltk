LOW SUGAR PRICES MAY ATTRACT SOVIET/CHINESE
  Any further decline in raw sugar prices
  is likely to attract buying from the Soviet Union and China,
  Woodhouse, Drake and Carey said in their latest weekly market
  report.
      Present lower terminal values may be a reflection of the
  lack of renewed prompt offtake, particularly from these two
  large consumers, the report said.
      The week has seen good demand for Thai raws, particulary
  for October/December shipment, which has traded above twenty
  points premium to the October New York delivery, it said.
