USDA DETAILS CONSERVATION CROP ENROLLMENT
  Farmers enrolled over 6.5 mln acres
  of program crops in the latest conservation reserve program
  signup and around four mln acres of non-program crops,
  Agriculture Department conservation specialists said.
      Soybean acreage amounted to less than two mln acres of the
  non-program crop acreage enrolled, a USDA analyst said. Heavy
  enrollment of non-base acreage in wheat states, of which a big
  percentage would be fallow and non-soybean land, accounted for
  a large portion of the non-program acreage, the analyst said.
      Wheat and corn acreage comprised slightly over 40 pct of
  the total 10,572,402 acres accepted into the ten-year program.
      USDA analysts gave the following enrollment breakdown:
      -- wheat  2,615,140 acres
      -- corn   1,894,764 acres
      -- barley   705,888 acres
      -- sorghum  585,552 acres
      -- cotton   417,893 acres
      -- rice       2,035 acres
      -- peanuts      611 acres
      -- tobacco      285 acres
      -- total program crops  6,512,700 acres
      -- total nonprogram     4,059,702 acres
      -- total enrollment    10,572,402 acres
      USDA analysts are currently working on a complete state
  breakdown of crop acreage enrollment and should have it ready
  for publication later this week, they said.
