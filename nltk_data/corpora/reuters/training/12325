NEW ZEALAND MAY BUY U.S. WHEAT -- USDA
  New Zealand may need about 100,000
  tonnes of wheat this year, which would normally come from
  Australia, but may be from the United States, the U.S.
  Agriculture Department said.
      In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, the
  department said with the deregulation of the New Zealand Wheat
  Board, which normally imports wheat from Australia, there is
  the possibility of wheat purchases from the united states since
  the shipping cost between New Zealand and the Eastern Coast of
  Australia and the West Coast of the United States are about
  equal.
