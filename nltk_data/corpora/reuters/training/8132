TAIWAN TO BOOST FARM IMPORTS FROM U.S., EUROPE
  Taiwan is expected to boost agricultural
  imports from the U.S. And Europe in calendar 1987 to help
  balance trade, the Council of Agriculture said.
      A council official, who declined to be named, told Reuters
  the imports, which will include about seven mln tonnes of
  oilseeds, grains and dairy products, would be worth some four
  billion U.S. Dlrs against 3.72 billion in 1986 and 3.38 billion
  in 1985.
      Taiwan's surplus with the U.S. Rose to 13.6 billion dlrs
  last year from 10.2 billion in 1985, government figures show.
      Government figures also show Taiwan's surplus with Europe
  rose to 1.53 billion dlrs last year from 543 mln in 1985.
      Taiwan's imports of U.S. Farm produce last year amounted to
  1.41 billion dlrs against 1.52 billion in 1985.
      Imports from Europe rose to 182 mln U.S. Dlrs from 148 mln,
  the official said.
      He attributed the decline in the value of U.S. Imports to
  falling agricultural products prices last year.
