&lt;D'OR VAL MINES LTD> FINDS HIGH-GRADE ORDER
  D'Or Val Mines Ltd said a recent
  drill hole from the surfrace has intersected high-grade ore in
  a downdip extension of the Discovery Vein in its D'Or Val Mine
  in northern Quebec.
      The company said 42.3 feet of the hole graded 0.92 ounce
  per short ton of gold, including a 17.5 foot section grading
  2.17 ounces.
      It said the zone is just below the projection of the
  seventh level of the mine about 1,450 feet below the surface
  and 820 feet west of the shaft.
      D'Or Val said this find and other recent ones will make
  substantial contributions to the mine's ore reserves and grade.
