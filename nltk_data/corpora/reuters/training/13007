COLOMBIAN INFLATION STABLE AT AROUND 20 PCT
  Colombia's cost of living index rose 2.71
  pct in March, after a 2.03 pct increase in February and a 2.21
  pct rise in March 1986, the government statistics institute
  said.
      The result brought year-on-year inflation to 20.36 pct
  compared with 22.65 pct at end-March 1986 and 19.77 pct for the
  year ending February 1987.
      The government has predicted that inflation this year would
  be slightly lower than in 1986 when it reached 20.9 pct.
