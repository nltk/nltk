FED'S HELLER URGES JAPANESE TO BUY U.S. GOODS
  A member of the Federal Reserve
  Board, Robert Heller, said he wanted to see stronger Japanese
  demand for American goods.
      "What I was advocating here was more Japanese purchases of
  American goods," Heller said in response to a question about the
  dollar's weakness in currency markets.
      He told a Heritage Foundation forum, "I'd be very happy to
  see that."
      In his formal remarks, Heller said he supported the idea of
  using commodity prices as an indicator for monetary policy.
      Asked if he would raise the issue at the next Federal Open
  Market Committee meeting, he said, "Even at previous meetings
  commodity prices were raised."
      He added, "I would not expect future meetings to be
  different from past meetings in that respect."
