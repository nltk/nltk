LEUCADIA &lt;LUK> HAS 7.2 PCT OF MINSTAR &lt;MNST>
  Leucadia National Corp said two of
  its subsidiaries have acquired a 7.2 pct stake in Minstar Inc,
  a corporation controlled by corporate raider Irwin Jacobs and
  used by him in his forays to acquire stock in companies.
      In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
  Leucadia said its LNC Investments Inc, a Newark, Del.,
  investment firm, and Charter National Life Insurance Co, a St.
  Louis joint stock life insurance company, bought their combined
  1,261,000 Minstar common shares for investment purposes only.
      The Leucadia subsidiaries had held an 11.0 pct stake in
  Minstar, but cut to 1.8 pct, or 313,200 shares, last July.
      Since July, Leucadia said its companies have bought 947,800
  Minstar common shares for a total of 24.7 mln dlrs.
      Leucadia said it bought the Minstar stake to obtain an
  equity position in the company and has no intention of seeking
  control of it.
      Nearly half of Leucadia's common stock is owned by TLC
  Associates, a Salt Lake City, Utah, general partnership, whose
  partners include the chairman and president of Leucadia and
  other investors.
