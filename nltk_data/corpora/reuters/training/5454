CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICAL &lt;CAAN> SEES FIRST QTR LOSS
  Cambridge Analytical Associates Inc said
  it expects to incur a loss for the first quarter of fiscal 1987
  equal to or greater than its loss of 240,697 dlrs for the
  fourth quarter ended December 31, 1986.
      Cambridge said it expects revenues for the first quarter to
  be approximately the same as those recorded for the fourth
  quarter ended December 31, 1986, of 1,025,961 dlrs.
      Cambridge recorded a profit of 2,204 dlrs on revenues of
  847,000 dlrs for the first quarter of fiscal 1986, the company
  said.
      The company attributed the expected loss to lower than
  expected sales from its laboratory and consulting business and
  planned major investment in its proprietary treatment
  technology.
      The company said winter is traditionally its slowest
  season.
