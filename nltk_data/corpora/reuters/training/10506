COCOA BUFFER STOCK RULES EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY
  The cocoa buffer stock rules just
  decided by the International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council
  will take effect immediately, delegates said.
      That means the buffer stock manager is likely to begin
  buying cocoa within two or three weeks, after organizing
  communication systems and assessing the market, they said.
