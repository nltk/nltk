NORANDA SAYS FIRE CAUSED 10 MLN DLRS IN DAMAGE
  &lt;Noranda Inc> said a copper
  mine fire that killed one miner and trapped 44 others for
  nearly a day caused an estimated 10 mln Canadian dlrs in
  damage.
      The fire, which started Wednesday and burned for more than
  24 hours, destroyed the mine's three-year-old conveyor system,
  officials said.
      Michel Lefebvre, vice president of operations, said Noranda
  will operate the mine at about one third of its normal 72,000
  short ton annual finished capacity, using above ground
  reserves, until it decides whether to keep the mine open.
      "The events we sustained yesterday and the day before are a
  very serious setback for Gaspe Mines operations," Lefebvre said.
  Gaspe Mines is the name of the Noranda division that operates
  the Murdochville mine.
      He said it would take four or five months to bring
  operations up to full capacity if the company decides to do so,
  adding that he believes there is a good chance Noranda will
  fully reopen the mine.
