RAINIER &lt;RBAN> COMPLETES ACQUISITION
  Rainier Bancorp said it completed the
  acquisition of Tacoma, Wash.-based United Bank, for 59 mln dlrs

  offices, will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary, Rainier
  said.
      Rainier, which last month agreed to merge with Security
  Pacific Corp &lt;SPC>, said the United acquisition will increase
  its assets to 9.8 billion dlrs from the 9.2 billion reported at
  the end of 1986.
