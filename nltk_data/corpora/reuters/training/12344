CROWN RESOURCES &lt;CRRS> PLANS ENERGY UNIT SALE
  Crown Resources Corp said it plans to
  sell its Oklahoma-based oil and gas unit as part of its
  strategy to focus on developing precious metals properties.
      The company said it bought the Wyona Water Flood Oil and
  Gas unit in 1984 for 650,000 dlrs.
      Crown said the Wyona field is fully developed with 28
  producing wells.
      Current oil production is 80 barrels a day, it said, adding
  that no gas was produced for sale in 1986.
