WEST GERMAN EXPORTS TO U.S. DROP SHARPLY
  West German exports to the United
  States fell below four billion marks worth in January for the
  first time since mid-1984, provisional Bundesbank data showed.
      The figures showed exports were 3.85 billion marks in
  January, sharply down from December's 4.40 billion and the
  lowest since the 3.56 billion exported to the U.S. In July
  1984. This compared with 4.86 billion marks in January 1986.
      Total West German exports to Western industrialised
  countries also fell in January to 34.76 billion marks from
  December's 36.45 billion, also posting the lowest monthly total
  since July 1984.
      West German exports to the European Community were 21.60
  billion marks in January, down from 22.14 billion in December
  and 22.94 billion in January last year, the figures showed.
      Exports to developing nations and centrally-planned
  economies also slackened.
      Separately, Commerzbank AG said in a report that the focus
  of West German exports this year was likely to shift to Europe
  because of an expected downturn in growth in the dollar area.
      This was one of the strengths of West German exports
  compared with Japan, which depended in large part on the U.S.,
  OPEC and developing country markets, it added.
