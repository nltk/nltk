MIYAZAWA SAYS PRESENT YEN NOT NECESSARILY IDEAL
  Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a
  parliamentary session the current dollar/yen exchange rate is
  not necessarily satisfactory for the Japanese economy.
      Miyazawa said the Paris currency accord among six major
  industrial nations last month does not necessarily mean the yen
  should stay stable around current levels in the future.
      The Paris agreement was aimed at stopping a further rapid
  fluctuation of exchange rates, he said.
      The accord stipulated that current rates reflect
  fundamentals of the six nations - Britain, Canada, France,
  Japan, the U.S. And West Germany.
