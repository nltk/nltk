40 MINERS TRAPPED BY FIRE IN GASPE COPPER MINE
  Some 40 miners were trapped
  underground today by a fire in a copper mine in the Gaspe area
  of eastern Quebec, officials said.
      There were no reports of any deaths.
      A mine official said that the fire broke out last night and
  about 25 of the miners made it to safety.
      He said telephone contact had been established with the
  trapped miners but they could not be brought to the surface
  until the fire was extinguished.
      The cause of the fire was not known.
