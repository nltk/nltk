COLOMBIA WILL NOT ATTEND MANAGUA COFFEE MEETING
  Colombia will not attend a meeting of
  coffee producing countries scheduled for this weekend in
  Nicaragua, Jorge Cadenas, manager of the National Coffee
  Growers' Federation, said.
      "We prefer to wait until things are better prepared," he told
  Reuters. He added the meeting could be postponed.
      Colombia, Brazil and the Central American coffee producing
  countries were invited to the meeting in Managua to analyze the
  market situation
      However, he did not dismiss the idea of dialogue and
  negotiation in preparation for meetings of the International
  Coffee Organization.
      Gilberto Arango, president of Colombia's exporters'
  association, speaking to Reuters earlier this week, ruled out a
  fresh Colombian initiative on export quotas saying producers
  had now to show a common resolve which could emerge from
  continuous contacts.
      The International Coffee Organization executive board is to
  meet in London between March 31 and April 2.
