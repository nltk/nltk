N.Z. PORTS REOPEN, BUT FURTHER DISRUPTION LIKELY
  New Zealand ports reopened at 0730
  hrs local time (1930 GMT March 22) after being closed since
  March 19 because of a strike over pay claims by watersiders, a
  Waterside Federation spokesman said.
      But industrial action by other port workers is likely to
  cause further disruption, Harbour Workers union secretary Ross
  Wilson told Reuters.
      Wilson said his members are holding stopwork meetings this
  morning to consider further stoppages over their pay claim.
      The two disputes are not related.
      Harbour Workers around the country went on strike for 24
  hours on March 16, but Wilson said any further action will
  occur on a port-by-port basis.
