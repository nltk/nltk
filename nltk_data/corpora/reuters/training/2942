U.S. TREASURY PROPOSES S.AFRICAN URANIUM IMPORTS
  The U.S. Treasury proposed allowing 
  temporary imports of South African uranium ore and uranium
  oxide until July 1 under certain conditions pending
  clarification of anti-apartheid laws passed by Congress last
  fall.
      The Treasury said it proposed allowing the temporary
  imports because it felt Congress had not intended when it
  passed the comprehensive South African sanctions bill last fall
  -- overriding President Reagan's veto -- to hurt U.S. industry.
      The Treasury said an outright U.S. ban of uranium ore and
  oxide might cause foreign electric utilities to divert their
  South African origin ore and oxide to other countries including
  the Soviet Union for processing.
      The Treasury also proposed allowing U.S.-origin goods to be
  imported temporarily from South African state-controlled
  organizations for repair or servicing in the U.S.
      The South African sanctions law, enacted by the U.S. to
  protest the apartheid laws of racial segregation practiced by
  South Africa's white minority government, prohibited imports of
  uranium ore and oxide, iron and steel, coal and textiles at the
  end of 1986.
