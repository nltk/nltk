HARCOURT BRACE &lt;HBJ> SETS HARPER &lt;HPR> DEADLINE
  Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc
  said it has told Harper and Row Publishers Inc representatives
  that it intends to withdraw its proposal to acquire Harper and
  Row for 50 dlrs per share in cash if the parties have not made
  satisfactory progress in discussions by the close of business
  on March 30.
      Harcourt Brace said, "We do not wish to put undue pressure
  on Harper and Row, but we also, in fairness to our own
  shareholders, cannot allow an offer of such magnitude to lie on
  the table too long."
      Harcourt said three of its senior officers and its
  investment bankers met yesterday with investment bankers for
  Harper and Row to discuss the Harcourt Brace offer.
      Harcourt Brace said it will only pursue the acquisition if
  a mutually-satisfactory merger agreement can be negotiated.
      Last week, a group formed by Theodore Cross offered to
  acquire Harper and Row for 34 dlrs per share.  The group held
  about six pct of Harper and Row.
      In addition, New World Pictures Ltd &lt;NWP>, holder of 4.5
  pct of Harper and Row, had offered to discuss a merger with
  Harper and Row.
