INDIA AGAIN IN MARKET FOR SUGAR - TRADE
  India has called a fresh buying tender
  for up to four 13,000 tonne cargoes of white sugar on March 11,
  traders here said.
      The tender calls for one cargo of prompt sugar and two to
  three with March/April shipment sugar, or the same as the eight
  cargoes bought at a tender two days ago. That tender originally
  only sought two to three cargoes but resulted in the sale of
  eight. India also granted the sellers options to sell twice
  that amount at the same price but for April/May shipment.
      Depending on prices, traders said it would be likely for
  India again to buy more than the tonnage formally sought.
