WEST GERMAN 1986 OIL MEALS, CAKES USE UP
  West German consumption of oilmeals and
  oil cakes last year rose by 2.4 pct to 6.3 mln tonnes, the
  agriculture ministry said.
      It said in a statement the increase was exclusively due to
  sharply higher use of rape products, which went up by 8.9 pct
  to 1.08 mln tonnes.
      Use of soy products dropped 7.2 pct to 2.89 mln tonnes, it
  added.
