EC APPROVES MEDITERRANEAN FINANCIAL PACKAGES
  EC ministers have approved financial
  packages for several Mediterranean states totalling 1.6 billion
  European currency units, an EC official said.
      The packages, part of special EC trade agreements with
  Tunisia, Egypt, Lebanon, Israel, Algeria, Morocco and Jordan
  until 1992, include 615 mln Ecus in grants, he said.
      They include one billion Ecus in loans from the European
  Investment Bank, the EC long-term financing arm. The framework
  for the transfers was signed yesterday by EC farm ministers
  after being agreed in principle by foreign ministers earlier.
