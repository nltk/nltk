CARBIDE &lt;UK> LOOKS TO ACQUISITIONS FOR GROWTH
  Union Carbide Corp is looking to
  acquisitions and joint ventures to aid its chemicals and
  plastics growth, according the H.W. Lichtenberger, president of
  Chemicals and Plastics.
      Describing this as a major departure in the company's
  approach to commercial development, he told the annual new
  business forum of the Commercial Development Association "We
  are looking to acquisitions and joint ventures when they look
  like the fastest and most promising routes to the growth
  markets we've identified."
      Not very long ago Union Carbide had the attitude "that if
  we couldn't do it ourselves, it wasn't worth doing. Or, if it
  was worth doing, we had to go it alone," Lichtenberger
  explained.
      He said "there are times when exploiting a profitable
  market is done best with a partner. Nor do we see any need to
  plow resources into a technology we may not have if we can link
  up profitably with someone who is already there."
      He said Carbide has extended its catalyst business that way
  and is now extending its specialty chemicals business in the
  same way.
