CARTERET SAVINGS&lt;CBC> COMPLETES SALE OF BRANCHES
  Carteret Savings Bank said it
  has completed the previously announced sale of six Virginia
  branches to Charter Federal Savings and Loan Association
  &lt;CHFD>.
      Carteret said it has opened a retail banking office in
  Vienna, Va., as the next step in its move to build a strong
  presence in the Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Md., area.
      Carteret said the new bank has two offices outside
  Baltimore, which were acquired last June when Carteret merged
  with Admiral Builders Savings and Loan Association.
      The company said it plans to open a retail banking office
  in downtown Washington this summer, plus several more offices
  in Baltimore County and others in Fairfax County, Va. Carteret
  said it may open more loan offices in Virginia and Maryland.
