FTC EASES ALLIED-SIGNAL &lt;ALD> UNIT RESTRICTIONS
  The Federal Trade Commission said it
  eased a requirement that Allied-Signal Inc's Allied Corp
  subsidiary get prior FTC approval before making certain
  acquisitions in the high-purity acid market.
      The FTC said it ended the prior approval requirement
  because Allied no longer has businesses covered by the order.
  Other restrictions still apply, it said.
      The restrcitions stem from a 1983 order by the FTC settling
  charges that Allied's 1981 acquisition of Fisher Scientific Co
  reduced competition in three high-purity acid markets.
