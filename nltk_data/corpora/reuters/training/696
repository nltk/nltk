DIAGNOSTIC PRODUCTS &lt;DPCZ> SEES EARNINGS GROWTH
  Diagnostic Products Corp president and
  chief executive officer Sigi Ziering said he expects to
  maintain the same compound average annal net income growth in
  1987 as the company has for the past five years.
      "We expect the same performance in net income over the next
  five years as we have had in the past," Ziering said.
      Over the past five years Ziering said the company has had
  average compound net income growth of 32 pct annually with a 27
  pct per year growth in earnings per share. For 1986 the company
  had net income of 6.3 mln dlrs, or 1.07 dlrs per share, vs 3.9
  mln dlrs, or 73 cts per share in 1985.
      Diagnostic manufactures medical immunological diagnostic
  test kits.
      Ziering said he expects the earnings growth to result from
  positive effect of the weaker dollar on the company's exports
  sales as well as accelerated market penetration. Ziering said
  he expected the Food and Drug Administration to approve three
  more of its drug abuse test kits by the end of the year, which,
  depending on approval, should also help earnings growth.
      Ziering said as a result of the new tax laws he expected
  the company's taxes to decrease by five pct to 31 pct of net
  income in 1987.
