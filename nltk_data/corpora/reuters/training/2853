TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE RESCUED FROM SINKING FERRY
  About 200 people were rescued, some
  badly hurt, from a sinking cross Channel ferry carrying
  approximately 540 people off the Belgian port of Zeebrugge, a
  port control spokesman said.
      The spokesman, contacted by telephone, said only one third
  of car ferry, the Herald of Free Enterprise owned by the
  British company Townsend Thoresen, remained above water.
      Divers have been sent down to try to rescue passengers
  believed trapped in the ferry, which was on its way from
  Zeebrugge to the English port of Dover and capsized just off
  the pier, he added
