COFFEE CONFERENCE ENDS WITH CALL TO CONTINUE TALKS
  A meeting of eight Latin American
  coffee producers ended with a call for continued talks aimed at
  arriving at an agreement to stabilize international prices.
      A statement delivered by the conference's president,
  Nicaragua's External Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca,
  said the object of future meetings would be to seek
  negotiations leading to basic export quotas.
      The meeting was attended by representatives from Brazil,
  Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica and
  Nicaragua. A Panamanian representative attended the meeting as
  an observer.
      Representatives at the meeting said efforts would continue
  to be made to reach a regional consensus on export quotas which
  could be presented to the International Coffee Organization.
      In opening the meeting, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega
  said the lack of an accord on export quotas was behind falling
  coffee prices, which he said have caused billions of dollars in
  losses to countries in the region.
      Jorio Dauster, president of the Brazilian Coffee Institute,
  said his government is committed to working towards an
  producers accord in order to bring about higher prices.
