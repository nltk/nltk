SEVEN OAKS &lt;QPON> IN TELEMARKETING VENTURE
  Seven Oaks International Inc
  said it has formed a new 80 pct owned subsidiary called Seven
  Oaks Direct Inc to offer a full line of telemarketing services.
      It said Seven Oaks direct management will own the remaining
  20 pct.
      The company said initial costs connected with the startupo
  of a new Memphis, Tenn., marketing center for Seven Oaks direct
  may hurt earnings slightly in the first half of the year ending
  in April 1988, but Seven Oaks Direct should operate at no worse
  than breakeven for fiscal 1988 as a whole.
