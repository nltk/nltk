N.Y. TRADERS SAY LATIN COFFEE PRODUCERS TO MEET
  Several traders and analysts here told
  Reuters Latin American coffee producers will meet this weekend
  in Managua, Nicaragua. The purpose, they said, is to review the
  breakdown of International Coffee Organization quota talks last
  month and try to formulate a unified position ahead of possible
  future negotiations.
      Two traders, who asked not to be named, said separately
  Brazil is expected to attend the meeting along with most or all
  of the Central American producers. The Central American
  attendees would include Costa Rica and Honduras, who were part
  of a minority producer group at the February talks that opposed
  Brazil's position, they said.
      Another source, also requesting anonymity, said Colombia
  probably will not attend.
