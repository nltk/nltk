EC DENIES MAIZE EXPORTS RESERVED FOR U.S.
  The agreement between the U.S. And the
  European Community (EC) on special imports of maize and sorghum
  provides an equal chance for all non-EC countries to supply the
  Spanish market, an EC Commission spokeswoman said.
      She denied that any unpublished clause of the agreement
  guaranteed the bulk of the maize export business would go to
  the U.S., As one EC official told Reuters yesterday.
      Under the agreement, the EC will import two mln tonnes of
  maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum a year into Spain at
  specially reduced levy rates for the next four years.
      The Commission has yet to decide whether the maize will
  come in through direct purchases by the Spanish intervention
  board or by a tender system.
