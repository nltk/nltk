LYNG SAYS TOO LATE FOR CROP DECOUPLING THIS YEAR
  U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
  Lyng said it is too late to implement a full 0/92 acreage
  provision, or "decoupling," for 1987 grain crops.
      "I think there's a chance we'll see that legislation (0/92)
  passed, (but) not for 1987 crops. It's too late," Lyng told the
  National Grain and Feed Association convention here.
      Lyng added that there seems some support in Congress for
  0/92 and there was a good chance a pilot 0/92 program will be
  passed as part of a pending disaster bill.
      But he indicated that it is already too late in the year to
  alter the 1987 crop program. Sign-up for spring crops closes
  the end of this month.
      Overall, Lyng predicted very little change will be
  legislated in the 1985 farm bill this year.
