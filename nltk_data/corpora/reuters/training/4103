INDIA 1986/87 COTTON EXPORT QUOTA UP 190,000 BALES
  India's raw cotton export quota has
  been raised by 190,000 170-kg bales to 600,000 bales in 1986/87
  ending August, still well below the 1985/86 quota of 1.35 mln
  bales, Minister of State for Textiles R.N. Mirdha said.
      State and private agencies contracted to export 1.34 mln
  bales in 1985/86, he told journalists. But only 433,000 bales
  were shipped that year, with the rest to be delivered in
  1986/87. About 758,000 bales from 1985/86 contracts were
  shipped up to February 2 in 1986/87.
       The government will export 600,000 bales of long and
  extra- long staple cotton in the three years from 1986/87, he
  said.
