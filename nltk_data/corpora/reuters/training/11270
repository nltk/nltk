ESSO MALAYSIA REPORTS HIGHER PROFIT IN 1986
  Esso Malaysia Bhd, a unit of Exxon
  Corp of the U.S., Reported net profit of 70 mln ringgit from
  its petroleum and ammonia operations in 1986 compared with 48.7
  mln in 1985. Chairman Gerald F Cox said the improved
  performance was mainly due to product prices falling more
  slowly than crude prices during the year.
      He added that total sales volume increased as a result of
  higher offtake by affiliated companies, while inland market
  sales were maintained at around the previous year's levels.
      But growth prospects in 1987 remained weak and 1986 results
  are unlikely to be repeated in the current financial year.
