U.K. MONEY MARKET OFFERED EARLY ASSISTANCE
  The Bank of England said it invited an
  early round of bill offers from discount houses after
  forecasting a shortage in the system of some 1.05 billion stg.
      Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing
  in official hands and treasury bill take-up will drain some
  1.07 billion stg while exchequer transactions will take out
  around 335 mln stg and bankers' balances below target five mln
  stg.
      Partly offseting these outflows, a fall in note circulation
  will add some 355 mln stg to the system today.
