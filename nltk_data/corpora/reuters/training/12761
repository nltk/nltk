AUSTRALIAN TUG CREWS DELAY FOREIGN CONTAINER SHIPS
  Tug crews are preventing the movement of
  foreign-flag container vessels in and out of the ports of
  Sydney, Melbourne and Fremantle, shipping sources said.
      They said maritime unions imposed bans on late Wednesday
  for reasons that are obscure but seem to be linked with claims
  for a pay rise above the 10 dlrs a week awarded by the
  Arbitration Commission nationally to all workers recently.
      Only about 10 vessels are being delayed but the bans will
  affect container terminal movements and will disrupt liner
  schedules, they said.
      The dispute goes to the Commission on Monday, they said.
