DEALERS WARY OVER STERLING INTERVENTION RUMOUR
  Foreign exchange market rumours that the
  the Bank of England has been selling sterling to halt its rise
  prompted a wary response from dealers who said they saw no
  obvious confirmation, market sources said.
      Bank of England officials were not immediately available
  for comment. Earlier this week, the Bank sanctioned a cut in
  bank interest rates in a surprise move, which aimed at limiting
  sterling's rise ahead of the March 17 budget.
      But today the pound has strengthened to 72.7 on its
  trade-weighted index from 72.1 last night, though the U.K.
  Currency is below its day's high against the dollar.
