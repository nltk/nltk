CCC GUARANTEES TO TURKEY SWITCHED TO MEALS-USDA
  The Commodity Credit Corporation,
  CCC, has reallocated 15.0 mln dlrs in credit guarantees to
  Turkey previously earmarked for sales of U.S. oilseeds to
  provide coverage for sales of U.S. protein meals in fiscal year
  1987, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
      The department said the action reduces the guarantee line
  authorized for sales of oilseeds to 5.0 mln dlrs from 20.0 mln
  dlrs and creates the new line for protein meals.
      All sales under the credit lines must be registered and
  exports completed by September 30, 1987, it said.
