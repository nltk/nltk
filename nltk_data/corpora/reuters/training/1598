INDIA BUYS UP TO 10 CARGOES SUGAR - TRADERS
  India bought up to 10 cargoes of white
  sugar at a buying tender today which originally called for just
  two to three cargoes of March/April shipment, traders said.
      London trader E D and F Man said it sold two cargoes at 233
  dlrs a tonne CIF for March/April shipment with an option to
  sell an additional two cargoes at the same price.
      Traders said at least one other international trader made a
  similar contract while a French house sold two cargoes at an
  outright price of 233 dlrs CIF without the option. This brought
  total Indian purchases to at least six cargoes with traders
  having options to sell another four.
