  &lt;Interconnect Capital Corp>
  said it sent a letter to the board of Gates Learjet Corp,
  offering to buy the company for 7.07 dlrs a share.
      Gates Corp, which owns 64.8 pct of Gates Learjet, agreed
  earlier this week to sell its shares to a partnership formed by
  privately-held &lt;Cobey Corp> and a unit of Bear Stearns Cos Inc
  &lt;BSC> for 6.50 dlrs a share or 51 mln dlrs. The proposal is
  subject to approval by Gates Learjet's board.
      A spokesman for privately-held Interconnect said it made
  the new proposal to Gates Learjet's board, but would not say if
  it had held talks with the parent company's board.
