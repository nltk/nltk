U.S. AGRICULTURE SECRETARY WARNS EC ON SOY OIL TAX
  U.S. Agriculture Secretary
  Richard Lyng warned the European Community yesterday it will
  face serious retaliation if it enacts a new tax on products
  such as U.S. Soybean oil.
      Speaking at a news conference before a scheduled speech,
  Lyng said he did not think the tax, which is still in the
  discussion stage, would be approved.
      He said the U.S. Would take serious retaliatory action
  because if implemented, the tax would have a considerable
  impact on U.S. Farmers.
