HUNGARY TO DEVALUE FORINT AGAINST WESTERN UNITS
  Hungary is to devalue the forint by an
  average of eight pct against Western currencies, the official
  news agency MTI said.
      MTI did not say when the devaluation would become
  effective, but it expected new rates to be announced later
  today.
      Hungary devalued the forint by a similar amount last
  September 23. Western bankers say the forint is more
  realistically valued than currencies of Hungary's COMECON
  allies.
