AUSTRALIA SELLS 180,000 TONNES OF SUGAR TO USSR
  Australia sold 180,000 tonnes of raw
  sugar to the Soviet Union for shipment in the next few weeks,
  Queensland Primary Industries Minister Neville Harper said.
      Loading of a 50,000-tonne cargo on the Soviet freighter
  Nikolay Kuznetsov for shipment to Odessa was completed today at
  the Lucinda terminal, he said in a statement.
      The balance will be shipped from Mackay by end-March,
  Harper said.
      Australia exported 159,000 tonnes of sugar to the Soviet
  Union in 1986.
