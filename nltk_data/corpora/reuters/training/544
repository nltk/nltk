PANHANDLE'S &lt;PEL> TRUNKLINE REDUCES GAS RATES
  Panhandle Eastern Corp's Trunkline Gas
  Co pipeline subsidiary said it is reducing the commodity
  component of its wholesale natural gas rate four pct, effective
  immediately.
      In a filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,
  Trunkline said, it is reducing its commodity rate -- the
  portion of the total rate based on the price of gas -- to 2.58
  dlrs per mln Btu from 2.69 dlrs per mln Btu.
      The company said the lower rate results from a reduction in
  the average price the pipeline is paying for gas, adding this
  reflects contract reformation agreemats with producers.
