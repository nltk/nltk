U.S. COMMERCE SECRETARY SEES HIGHER GNP GROWTH
  Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige
  said a 0.7 pct rise in February's index of leading indicators
  pointed to stronger economic growth in the first half of 1987.
      In a statement commenting on the rise last month after a
  0.5 pct January decline, Baldrige noted the leading index was
  rising at an 8.0 pct annual rate in the six months to the end
  of February.
      "Based on past relationships, that gain is consistent with
  stepped up growth in real GNP during the first half of 1987,"
  Baldrige said.
