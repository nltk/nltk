TAIWAN ISSUES MORE CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT
  The Central Bank issued 5.65 billion dlrs
  worth of certificates of deposit (CDs), boosting CD issues so
  far this year to 147.58 billion, a bank spokesman told Reuters.
      The new CDs, with maturities of six months, one year and
  two years, carry interest rates ranging from 4.07 pct to 5.12
  pct, he said.
      The issues are intended to help curb the growth of the M-1b
  money supply which has grown as a result of increasing foreign
  exchange reserves.
      The reserves hit a record 53 billion U.S. Dlrs last month.
