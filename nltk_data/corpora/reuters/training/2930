HOUSTON OIL TRUST &lt;HO> OMITS MARCH DISTRIBUTION
  Houston Oil Trust said there will be no
  cash distribution to the unit holders in March.
      The most significant factor for the lack of a distribution
  this month is the establishment of additional special cost
  escrow accounts, the company said, adding, that there may be no
  cash distribution in other months or during the remainder of
  the year.
      For March, the working interest owner will place 1.9 mln
  dlrs in special cost escrow accounts.
