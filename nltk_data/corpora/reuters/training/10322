JAPAN ALUMINIUM OUTPUT FALLS IN FEBRUARY
  Japanese aluminium output fell to 5,298
  tonnes in February from 7,472 in January and 14,280 a year
  earlier, preliminary International Trade and Industry Ministry
  figures show.
      Output fell sharply from a year ago as most aluminium firms
  stopped smelting in the past year due to cheap imports,
  industry sources said.
      Sales and end-month stocks in tonnes were:
              Feb 87   Jan 87   Feb 86
      Sales   36,557   38,678   75,687
      Stocks  53,248   56,620  127,083
