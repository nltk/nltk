U.K. MONEY MARKET DEFICIT FORECAST AT 450 MLN STG
  The Bank of England said it forecast a
  shortage of around 450 mln stg in the money market today.
      Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing
  in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain
  some 650 mln stg while a rise in note circulation will take out
  around 30 mln stg.
      Partly offsetting these outflows, bankers' balances above
  target and exchequer transactions will add some 200 mln stg and
  35 mln stg to the system respectively.
