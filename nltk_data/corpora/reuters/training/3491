QUEENSLAND PRESS BOARD RECOMMENDS MURDOCH OFFER
  The &lt;Queensland Press Ltd> (QPL) board
  said it unanimously recommended the one billion dlr takeover
  bid by &lt;Cruden Investments Pty Ltd>, a family company of News
  Corp Ltd &lt;NCPA.S> chief executive Rupert Murdoch.
      The 23 dlrs a share cash-only offer is nearly double the
  market price before News announced its now-completed bid for
  The Herald and Weekly Times Ltd &lt;HWTA.S> in early December and
  no other offer is likely, it said in a statement.
      Independent adviser, &lt;Wardley Australia Ltd>, had also
  concluded the offer was fair and reasonable, it added.
      QPL is already owned 48.3 pct by HWT.
