USSR CROP WEATHER SUMMARY -- USDA/NOAA
  Gradual warming continued in most
  regions of Western Soviet Union in the week ended April 4, the
  Joint Agricultural Weather Facility of the U.S Agriculture and
  Commerce Departments said.
      In its International Weather and Crop Summary, the agency
  said most of the region's precipitation fell as rain.
      The southern snow cover boundary continued to slowly
  retreat northward and eastward, it said.
      Moderate to deep snow cover the northern half of the
  Ukraine, northern North Caucasus, and the lower Volga, about
  one month later than usual, it said.
      The agency said average weekly temperatures were below
  normal in the southeast, near normal in the southwest and
  northeast, and above normal in the northwest.
      Winter grains remained dormant over the region, but warm
  weather promoted greening in crop areas adjacent to the Black
  Sea coast, it said.
