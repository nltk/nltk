SEASONAL STABILISATION SEEN FOR COFFEE PRICES
  The onset of cooler weather in Brazil
  during the southern hemisphere winter is expected to have a
  stabilising effect on a weak coffee market, West German trade
  sources said.
      "The annual fear of frost in Brazil will probably grip the
  market sometime this month until June or early July," one trader
  said.
      The trade believes the International Coffee Organization
  (ICO) is unlikely to tackle the re-introduction of quotas
  before its September meeting and until then the market will not
  see any unexpected sharp moves in either direction.
