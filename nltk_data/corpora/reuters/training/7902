ECHLIN&lt;ECH> EXPECTS CONTINUED PROFIT GROWTH
  Echlin Inc said it expects
  further earnings increases for the second half of fiscal 1987
  ending in August due to unit sales growth and improved
  operations.
      "As expected, market conditions have improved so that
  demand for automotive replacement parts is gradually and
  steadily expanding," Echlin president Frederick Mancheski said.
      Earlier, Echlin reported first half fiscal 1987, ended Feb
  28, earnings of 23.2 mln dlrs, or 48 cts a share, up from 16.6
