IBP (OXY) PLANT REOPENS WITHOUT INCIDENT
  Iowa Beef Processors Inc said
  "hundreds" of its employees returned to work at its Dakota
  City, Nebraska beef processing plant without incident.
      Last week, Iowa Beef said it would lift a lockout in effect
  at the plant since mid-December, which affected 2,800 members
  of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union.
      Both union and non-union meatpackers who returned to work,
  agreed to comply with Iowa Beef's last contract offer.
      "Start-up went well today and operations will continue to
  pick up as employees return and others are hired," according to
  a company statement. Picketing UFCWU members at the plant did
  not disrupt operations, a company spokesman said.
      "Our employees are asked to continue to return to work at
  8AM unless otherwise notified," he said.
      Iowa Beef, a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corp, said
  it is beginning to take applications for permanent positions at
  the plant.
