CHRYSLER &lt;C> SETS STOCK SPLIT, HIGHER DIVIDEND
  Chrysler Corp said its board declared a
  three-for-two stock split in the form of a 50 pct stock
  dividend and raised the quarterly dividend by seven pct.
      The company said the dividend was raised to 37.5 cts a
  share from 35 cts on a pre-split basis, equal to a 25 ct
  dividend on a post-split basis.
      Chrysler said the stock dividend is payable April 13 to
  holders of record March 23 while the cash dividend is payable
  April 15 to holders of record March 23. It said cash will be
  paid in lieu of fractional shares.
      With the split, Chrysler said 13.2 mln shares remain to be
  purchased in its stock repurchase program that began in late
  1984. That program now has a target of 56.3 mln shares with the
  latest stock split.
      Chrysler said in a statement the actions "reflect not only
  our outstanding performance over the past few years but also
  our optimism about the company's future."
