BRAZIL SEAMEN'S STRIKE ENDS
  A Brazilian seamen's strike, which
  began on February 27 and has been tapering off for weeks, has
  now ended, a seamen's spokesman said.
      The spokesman said the seamen had signed an agreement with
  the state-owned Lloyd Brasileiro company on Saturday for a 120
  pct salary rise.
      The national strike had been tailing off since mid-March as
  seamen struck individual accords with companies. At the height
  of the stoppage, seamen said about 200 ships were strike-bound.
