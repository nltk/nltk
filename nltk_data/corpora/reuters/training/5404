FED EXPECTED TO SET CUSTOMER REPURCHASES
  The Federal Reserve is expected to
  intervene in the government securities market to add reserves
  via two to 2.5 billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements,
  economists said.
      Economists said the Fed will inject temporary reserves
  indirectly to offset pressure on the Federal funds rate
  associated with quarterly corporate tax payments to the
  Treasury department.
      Fed funds opened at 6-1/4 pct and remained at that level
  late this morning. Friday funds averaged 6.05 pct.
