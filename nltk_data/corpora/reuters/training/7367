CSCE PUTS ADDITIONAL MARGIN ON JULY COFFEE
  An additional margin of 1,000 dlrs

  as of the opening of trade Monday, March 23, the Coffee, Sugar
  and Cocoa Exchange, CSCE, said.
      The March contract ends trading this week, making May and
  July the two "spot," or unlimited, contract months next week.

  net long or net short positions in the May and July contracts,
  including a 2,500 original margin plus the additional 1,000 dlr
  spot charge.
