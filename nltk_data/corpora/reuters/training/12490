OTHER MILDS COFFEE PRODUCERS TO MEET MAY 4
  Coffee producers belonging to the "Other
  Milds" group will meet May 4 in Guatemala to discuss the
  possibility of restoring export quotas, producer delegates told
  reporters after the closing session of the International Coffee
  Organization, ICO, executive board meeting.
      The "Other Milds" group, comprising Costa Rica, Dominican
  Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, India,
  Mexico, Nicaragua, Papua New Guinea and Peru, might consult
  with Brazil and Colombia on this meeting, but it was not
  certain whether these two countries would attend, they said.
      The ICO board meeting ended without moves to restart
  negotiations on quotas, which broke down last month, producer
  delegates said.
      Producers are expected to hold other consultations in the
  coming months on how to proceed with quota negotiations, but no
  date for a full producer meeting has been mentioned, they said.
      The board completed reports on stock verification and the
  next regular board session will be in Indonesia June 1-5,
  delegates said.
