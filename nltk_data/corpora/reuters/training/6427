U.S. REAL GNP ROSE 1.1 PCT IN FOURTH QUARTER
  The U.S. Gross National Product,
  after removing the impact of inflation, increased at a revised
  annual rate of 1.1 pct in the fourth quarter, the Commerce
  Department said.
      That was down from an earlier preliminary 1.3 pct rise
  estimated a month ago and down from the 2.1 pct rise in the
  fourth quarter of 1985.
      The final fourth quarter revision, however, left unchanged
  the previous estimate of a 2.5 pct increase in GNP for all of
  1986 over 1985.
      The revised estimate for fourth quarter GNP partly
  reflected a downward revision in inventories to a total
  decrease of 28.5 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter, the
  department said.
      The revisions also indicated personal consumption spending
  decreased 2.2 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter after an
  increase of 39.6 billion dlrs in the third quarter.
      Exports of goods and services rose 15.3 billion dlrs after
  a decline of 9.4 billion dlrs in the third quarter. Imports
  decreased 700 mln dlrs in the final quarter, in contrast to an
  increase of 20.9 billion dlrs in the third quarter.
