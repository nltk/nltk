GENERAL PARTNERS IN GENCORP &lt;GY> PROXY FIGHT
  General Partners, the group tendering
  for all GenCorp Inc shares at 100 dlrs each, said it has
  started soliciting proxies against GenCorp's proposals to
  increase its number of authorized shares outstanding, create a
  board with staggered election dates and eliminate cumulative
  voting.
      The proposals are to be voted on at the March 31 annual
  meeting.
      General Partners, a partnership of privately-held &lt;Wagner
  and Brown> and AFG Industries Inc &lt;AFG>, made the disclosure in
  a newspaper advertisement.
      The partnership has already filed suit in U.S. District
  Court in Columbus, Ohio, seeking to block a vote on the
  proposals and to invalidate GenCorp's defensive preferred share
  purchase rights.
      General Partners asked shareholders to either vote against
  the proposals or abstain from voting on them.
