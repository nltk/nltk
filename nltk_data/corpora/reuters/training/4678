KAMPUCHEA SAYS RICE CROP IN 1986 INCREASED
  Kampuchea harvested more than two mln
  tonnes of rice paddy in 1986, up on the crops of the previous
  two years, the official SPK news agency said yesterday.
      Diplomats said estimates put the 1985 harvest at less than
  one mln tonnes, slightly up on 800,000 in 1984.
      SPK said Kampuchea planned to expand planting from 1.5 mln
  to 1.93 mln hectares and boost rice paddy output to 2.5 mln
  tonnes this calendar year.
      Two mln tonnes of paddy would produce some 1.3 mln tonnes
  of milled rice, above the 1.25 mln tonnes Kampuchea says is the
  minimum its 7.5 mln people need.
