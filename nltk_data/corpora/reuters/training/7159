FED EXPECTED TO TAKE NO MONEY MARKET ACTION
  The Federal Reserve is expected to
  refrain from reserve-management intervention in the U.S.
  Government securities market, economists said.
      If the Fed does act, however, they said it would be likely
  to add temporary reserves indirectly by arranging around 1.5
  billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements.
      Federal funds, which averaged 5.97 pct yesterday, opened at
  six pct and remained there in early trading.
