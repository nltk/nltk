SOUTH KOREA TO HOLD CURRENT ACCOUNT SURPLUS DOWN
  South Korea plans to take steps to keep
  its 1987 current account surplus below five billion dlrs,
  Economic Planning Board Minister Kim Mahn-je said.
      Kim told reporters the government would repay loans ahead
  of schedule and encourage firms to increase imports and
  investment abroad to prevent the current account surplus from
  rising too quickly.
      Last year South Korea's current account surplus was 4.65
  billion dlrs. It widened to 622 mln dlrs in January from 484
  mln in December and compared with a deficit of 334 mln in
  January 1986, Bank of Korea figures show.
