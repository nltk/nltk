IRELAND PUT ON COLORADO BEETLE ALERT
  The Irish Agriculture Department issued
  a Colorado beetle alert today after three of the beetles were
  found in a box of parsley imported from France.
      Officials said a colony of the black and amber coloured
  beetles can destroy a potato field in a day. The females lay up
  to 2,500 eggs each.
      Some of the 80 boxes in the parsley consignment had already
  been distributed to markets and the department called on all
  shopkeepers and the catering trade to be on the alert.
