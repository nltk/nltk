BONN EXPRESSES SUPPORT FOR U.S. ON EC VEG OIL TAX
  The West German government expressed
  support for the U.S. Position in opposing the proposed European
  Community tax on vegetable oils and fats, a U.S. Embassy
  spokesman said.
      The spokesman, speaking from Bonn, said, "We have good
  reason to think West Germany holds to its resistance to the
  proposed tax."
      Several top government officials told the American Soybean
  Association and the National Soybean Processors Association
  delegations there was no reason for American producers and
  processors to pay for EC agriculture, the spokesman said.
      European agriculture was facing severe problems, but both
  the Community and the U.S. Should work closely within the
  framework provided by the General Agreement on Tariffs and
  Trade, he said.
      The delegations will continue their top level meetings in
  Bonn today but will not issue a statement before returning to
  the U.S. At the weekend.
      The EC and the U.S. Realised the tax issue would stay on
  the agenda for several months and there were indications that
  both sides would have to prepare for some tough negotiations,
  the spokesman said.
