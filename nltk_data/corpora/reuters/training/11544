EC MINISTERS EXTEND BEEF, MILK MARKETING YEARS
  European Community agriculture
  ministers agreed to extend the 1986/87 milk and beef marketing
  years to the end of May, Belgian minister Paul de Keersmaeker
  told a news conference.
      He said the reason for the two-month extension of the only
  EC farm product marketing years which end during the spring
  months was that it would be impossible for ministers formally
  to agree 1987/88 farm price arrangements before May 12.
      This is when the European Parliament is due to deliver its
  opinion on price proposals from the EC Commission.
