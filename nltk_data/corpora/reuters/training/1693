CHASE MANHATTAN STUDYING ITALIAN EXPANSION
  &lt;Chase Manhattan Bank N.A.> is considering
  expanding its operations in Italy, particularly in the consumer
  banking sector, a Chase Manhattan official said.
      Robert D. Hunter, Chase Manhattan area executive for
  Europe, Africa and the Middle East, said at a news conference
  that plans to broaden the bank's activities on the Italian
  market have not been finalised, however.
      Asked if Chase Manhattan would consider an acquisition in
  Italy, Hunter said: "We will look at any opportunity, but the
  prices of Italian banks have been quite high." Chase Manhattan
  has branches in Milan and Rome.
