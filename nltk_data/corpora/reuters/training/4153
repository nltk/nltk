DUDLEY TAFT TO PURSUE TAFT BROADCAST &lt;TFB> BID
  Taft Broadcasting Co vice chairman
  Dudley Taft and Narragansett Capital Inc &lt;NARR> said they
  intend to pursue their effort to acquire Taft Broadcasting
  despite the rejection yesterday of their 145 dlr per share
  offer by the Taft Broadcasting board.
      Dudley Taft and Narragansett, in a joint statement, said
  they intend to explore alternatives to achieve the acquisition,
  including further talks with Taft Broadcasting.
      They said they are confident that the Taft Broadcasting
  board will conclude that the resolution of the company's
  current "unstable situation" as quickly as possible is in the
  best interests of all parties.
      They said the Taft board did not conclude that their offer
  was not fair to Taft shareholders.  Taft Broadcasting
  yesterday, however, said financial advisor Goldman, Sachs and
  Co found the offer to be inadequate.
