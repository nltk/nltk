USAIR &lt;U> AND UNIT REMAIN UNDER MOODY'S REVIEW
  Moody's Investors Service Inc said the
  212.75 mln dlrs of debt of USAir Group Inc and its USAir Inc
  unit remain under review for possible downgrade.
      The rating agency cited USAir Group's proposed acquisition
  of Piedmont Aviation Inc &lt;PIE>, as well as Trans World Airlines
  Inc's &lt;TWA> proposed cash merger with USAir.
      However, the status of TWA's bid for USAir Group is
  currently uncertain. The U.S. Transportation Department has
  rejected TWA's application to acquire USAir on deficiency
  grounds, but TWA has said it will file a revised application,
  Moody's noted.
      Under Moody's review for possible downgrade are USAir
  Group's Baa-1 senior debt and Baa-2 subordinated debentures,
  along with the USAir unit's A-3 senior debt and Baa-1
  subordinated debentures.
      Moody's said it would examine the effects of the proposed
  mergers on USAir Group's financial measurements, as well as
  potential damage to the company's financial flexibility because
  of the probability of increased debt-service requirements.
