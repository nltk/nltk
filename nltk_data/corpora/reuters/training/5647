GENCORP &lt;GY> 1ST QTR OPERATING EARNINGS ROSE
  GenCorp said its first quarter
  earnings from operations rose four pct as sales increased six
  pct to 650 mln dlrs from 614 mln a year earlier.
      However, the company reported net income declined to 17 mln
  dlrs, or 77 cts a share, in the quarter ended February 28 from
  19 mln dlrs, or 84 cts a year earlier. This year's net included
  700,000 dlrs from the sale of assets while last years was
  increased 3.0 mln dlrs by such sales.
      GenCorp said lower operating profits for the tire and
  plastics and industrial products segments were essentially
  offset by higher wallcovering results.
