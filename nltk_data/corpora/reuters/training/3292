CENTRAL BANKERS SATISFIED WITH PARIS ACCORD
  Central bankers said they
  were generally satisfied with the response to the Paris accord
  two weeks ago to stabilize currencies at around current levels.
      Speaking after a meeting at the Bank for International
  Settlements (BIS), which reviewed the agreement, they also
  welcomed interest rates cuts in France and today's drop in
  British rates.  One top official said the rate cuts would help
  to stimulate growth generally in Europe and welcomed that
  countries other than West Germany were seen to be helping
  sustain the economy. 
      The central bankers, who spoke on the condition they not be
  named, said the meeting of governors from the Group of 10
  countries also heard a report from Michel Camdessus, the new
  managing director of the International Monetary Fund, on the
  IMF's latest assessment of the debt crisis. In particular, they
  discussed Brazil's debt moratorium.
      But there was no sense of urgency, they said, and Brazil
  had made no appeal for bridging loans from the BIS or central
  banks.
