ROPAK &lt;ROPK> HAS 34 PCT OF BUCKHORN &lt;BKN>
  Ropak Corp said it received
  and accepted about 456,968 common shares and 527,035 Series A
  convertible preferred shares of Buckhorn Inc at four dlrs and
  5.75 dlrs each respectively in response to its tender offer
  that expired Friday, and it now owns 34.4 pct of Buckhorn
  voting power.
      The company had owned 63,000 common and 25,100 preferred
  shares before starting the hostile tender.  Ropak said it is
  borrowing the funds needed to buy the Buckhorn shares from its
  bank lender and will not need to use any funds that another
  bank had committed to provide under a margin loan.
      Ropak said it waived minimum acceptance requirements to buy
  the shares and intends to evaluate a number of possible ways of
  completing an acquisition of Buckhorn.  It said it hopes that
  Buckhorn's board will reevaluate its position and enter into
  meaningful negotiations.
