WINTER WEATHER HURTS EAST GERMAN GRAIN - USDA
  Shifts from mild to very cold
  weather in East Germany damaged winter barley and late sown
  winter wheat in central regions and barley north of Berlin, the
  U.S. agricultural officer in East Berlin said.
      In a field report, the officer said indications were that
  winter kill might well be more than 100,000 hectares compared
  with 38,000 last year.
      He said the damage was probably more limited in southern
  and central regions and most widespread in the north.
      Damage was most severe on plants above the ground where
  little or no snow cover was present, he added.
      The officer said heavy frosts at night followed by sunshine
  during the day led to some heaving, particularly for well
  developed plants and for winter barley.
      Furthermore, as the ground surface thawed, some standing
  water occurred in the fields.
      The officer said repairing damage will probably call for
  special measures this spring in fields with damaged plants and
  where stands are thin. Harrowing, as well as well-timed
  applications of nitrogen, will be necessary, he added.
