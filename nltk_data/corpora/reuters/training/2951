JUSTICE ASKS U.S. DISMISSAL OF TWA (TWA) FILING
  The Justice Department told the
  Transportation Department it supported a request by USAir 
  Group that the DOT dismiss an application by Trans World
  Airlines Inc for approval to take control of USAir.
      "Our rationale is that we reviewed the application for
  control filed by TWA with the DOT and ascertained that it did
  not contain sufficient information upon which to base a
  competitive review," James Weiss, an official in Justice's
  Antitrust Division, told Reuters.
