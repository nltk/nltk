CHINA RAISES CROP PRICES TO INCREASE OUTPUT
  China has raised the prices it pays
  farmers for cotton, edible oil, sugar cane and beets to reverse
  a decline in output in 1986, He Kang, Minister of Agriculture,
  Animal Husbandry and Fisheries said.
      The China Daily quoted He as saying China should adopt
  intensive farming to increase per hectare output and improve
  crop quality and maintain arable land at 111 mln hectares. He
  gave no details of the price increases.
      On grain, He said the state will cut the quota it purchases
  from farmers by 50 mln tonnes and abolish the practice of
  purchasing through agents.
      He said the state will increase investment in agriculture
  and supplies of fertiliser, diesel oil and other production
  materials and stabilise fertiliser and diesel oil prices.
      The state offers cheap fertiliser and diesel oil and
  payment in advance to farmers who contract to supply grain at a
  low state-fixed price.
      He said China aims to produce between 425 and 450 mln
  tonnes of grain by 1990, up from a target of 405 mln this year
  and an actual 391 mln last year.
      He gave no more details.
