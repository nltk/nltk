BORG-WARNER &lt;BOR> TELLS OF TALKS WITH JACOBS
  Borg-Warner Corp said it has had
  discussions with Irwin Jacobs on his interest in the
  possibility of Minstar Inc &lt;MNST>, a Jacobs controlled company,
  being given access to certain non-public information about
  Borg-Warner.
      In late February, an investor group headed by Jacobs
  offered 44 dlrs a share, or 3.29 billion dlrs, to take over
  Borg-Warner.
      Borg-Warner said it advised Jacobs that before its board
  would give Minstar access to company records Minstar would have
  to provide satisfactory evidence that sufficient financing was
  committed to carry out whatever transaction was proposed.
      A Borg-Warner spokesperson said the discussions with Jacobs
  and other Minstar officials focused on terms and conditions
  under which the company would consider granting Minstar access
  to the information it was seeking.
      The Borg-Warner spokesperson said the company has not been
  able to reach an agreement with Minstar, and Borg-Warner has
  not granted Minstar access to any records.
      There can be no assurance that there will be further
  discussions with Jacobs or that any agreement will be reached,
  the company added.
