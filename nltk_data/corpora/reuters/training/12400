SANWA BANK LOOKS TO SECURITIES, WORLD OPERATIONS
  The &lt;Sanwa Bank Ltd's> three-year business
  plan foresees securities and international operations making a
  greater contribution to operating profits, a bank official
  said.
      The bank's plan also emphasises retail and medium and
  small-sized business operations, he told Reuters.
      Officials at &lt;Fuji Bank Ltd> and &lt;Mitsubishi Bank Ltd>
  outlined similar three-year plans.
      They said lower interest rates and financial liberalisation
  have cut profits from dealings with big firms to nearly
  nothing.
      "They don't need us, they can do their own financing," one
  official said.
      Sanwa Bank's plan forecasts that securities and
  international operations will contribute 40 pct of total
  operating profits by the end of the fiscal year ending March,
  1990, compared with 30 pct in fiscal 1985, the Sanwa official
  said.
