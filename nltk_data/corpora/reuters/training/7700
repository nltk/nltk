U.S. GRAIN ANALYSTS SEE LOWER CORN, SOY PLANTING
  Grain analysts surveyed by the American
  Soybean Association, ASA, projected acreage this year at 59.1
  mln acres of soybeans and 64.7 mln acres of corn.
      In 1986, farmers planted 61.5 mln acres of soybeans and
  76.7 mln acres of corn, according to the February 9 USDA
  supply/demand report. The USDA is to release its 1987 planting
  intentions report March 31.
      The survey included 15 soybean estimates and 13 corn
  estimates and was released in the March 16 Soybean Update
  newsletter sent to members.
      Estimates ranged from 56.0 mln to 63.0 mln acres of
  soybeans and 59.5 mln to 68.0 mln acres of corn.
      An ASA spokesman said the association plans no survey of
  farmers' planting intentions this year.
