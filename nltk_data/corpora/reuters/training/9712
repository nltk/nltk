TRADE SURPLUS CUT WOULD BENEFIT JAPAN - SUMITA
  Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita
  said it is in Japan's national interest to make greater efforts
  to reduce its trade surplus.
      He told business executives the most important issues for
  the world economy are the correction of international trade
  imbalances and a solution to the world debt problem.
      To this end, Japan and the U.S. Must make medium- and
  long-term efforts to alter economic structures which have
  expanded the trade gap between the two nations. World economic
  growth and therefore an expansion of debtor countries' export
  markets are needed to solve the debt issue, he added.
