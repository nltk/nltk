BANK OF ENGLAND OFFERS EARLY HELP IN MONEY MARKET
  The Bank of England said it had invited
  the discount houses to make an early round of bill offers to
  help offset a large liquidity shortage in the money market.
      It estimated the shortage at around 1.55 billion stg, one
  adverse factor being the unwinding of a sale and repurchase
  agreement, with the market having to buy back bills worth 542
  mln stg from the Bank.
      Bills maturing in official hands and the treasury bill
  take-up would drain 957 mln stg wile exchequer transactions and
  a note circulation rise would take out 15 mln and 25 mln
  respectively. Above target bankers' balances would add 10 mln.
