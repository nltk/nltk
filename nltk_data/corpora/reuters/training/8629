U.K. MONEY MARKET DEFICIT FORECAST AT 300 MLN STG
  The Bank of England said it forecast a
  shortage of around 300 mln stg in the money market today.
      Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing
  in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain
  some 338 mln stg while bankers' balances below target will take
  out around 25 mln stg.
      Partly offsetting these outflows, a fall in note
  circulation and exchequer transactions will add some 45 mln stg
  and 25 mln stg to the system respectively.
