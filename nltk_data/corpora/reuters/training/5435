MIM TO ACQUIRE STAKE IN GERMAN COPPER PRODUCER
  Mount Isa Mines Holding Ltd plans to
  acquire a 30 pct stake in Europe's largest primary copper
  producer, Norddeutsche Affinerie AG, a spokesman for
  Metallgesellschaft AG said.
      MIM intends to take Preussag AG's total 20 pct share in the
  copper producer in exchange for some three pct of MIM's share
  capital. MIM will also take another 10 pct now held by Degussa
  AG, reducing Degussa's share to 30 pct from 40.
  Metallgesellschaft's share will remain at 40 pct.
      The move is subject to approval of the federal cartel
  office and supervisory boards of the companies involved.
