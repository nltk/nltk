MEXICO VEG OIL TAX NOT AIMED AT SUNFLOWER--USDA
  The Mexican Secretariat of Commerce
  has told the U.S. that recent implementation of a 10 pct ad
  valorem tariff for fixed vegetable oils, fluid or solid, crude,
  refined or purified, was not targeted at sunflower oil, the
  U.S. Agriculture Department said.
      In its World Production and Trade Report, the department
  said the increase in tariffs on this category which includes
  sunflower, corn and rapeseed oils, was a reaction to importers
  using basket categories to avoid paying tariffs on specific
  high-tariff products.
