TREASURY'S BAKER SEES SMALLER TRADE DEFICIT
  Treasury secretary James Baker
  predicted the U.S. trade deficit would decline 15-20 billion
  dlrs this year.
      However, he acknowledged signs were still lacking on such a
  decline.
      "We think we are beginning to see changes," he told the House
  Appropriations Committee.
      "It has begun to level off (but) we don't see it beginning
  to go down yet," he told the panel.
