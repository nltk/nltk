U.S. MARKET LOAN NOT THAT ATTRACTIVE-BOSCHWITZ
  A marketing loan for U.S. wheat,
  feedgrains and soybeans would do nothing to help the surplus
  production situation and would be extremely costly, Sen. Rudy
  Boschwitz (R-Minn.) said.
      "I think I would not support a marketing loan now," he told
  the House agriculture subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and
  feedgrains. Boschwitz was one of the original supporters of a
  marketing loan for cotton and rice, but has since focused
  support on decoupling legislation, the Boren/Boschwitiz bill.
      A market loan for grains and soybeans would encourage more
  production, especially in high-yielding areas, would be much
  more expensive than the current cotton and rice marketing loans
  and not increase exports significantly, he said.
