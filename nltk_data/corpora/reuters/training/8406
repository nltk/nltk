ALLEGHENY &lt;AI> SUED OVER PROPOSED BUYOUT
  Allegheny International Inc said it
  and First Boston Inc's &lt;FBC> Sunter Holdings Corp subsidiary
  have been named as defendants in a class action filed in the
  Court of Common Pleas for Allegheny County, Pa., which seeks an
  injunction against Allegheny's proposed merger into Sunter.
      The company said its board and some former directors and
  First Boston were also named as defendants.
      It said it and Sunter intend to vigorously oppose the
  action.
      Allegheny said the class action suit alleges the price to
  be paid in the transaction is grossly unfair. The company said
  the suit's allegations are similar to those contained in an
  earlier federal court suit.
