CURRENCIES COULD INFLUENCE BULLION AGAIN-MONTAGU
  Currency fluctuations may reassert their
  influence on the bullion market in the near future, bullion
  bankers Samuel Montagu and Co Ltd said in a market report.
      But the firm said silver may lag behind gold in any
  reactions to movements on foreign exchanges.
      "OPEC's failure to address the recent decline in oil prices
  remains a worrying factor however, and on balance it appears
  that the market should be approached cautiously," Montagu said.
      The bank said the US economy has shown no noticeable
  long-term improvement and that both Latin American debt and the
  Iranian arms affair could undermine confidence in the dollar.
