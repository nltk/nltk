JAPAN BUYS MODEST AMOUNT OF DOLLARS, DEALERS SAY
  The Bank of Japan bought a modest amount
  of dollars this morning, possibly around 200 to 300 mln,
  dealers said.
      One dealer said the central bank bought about 200 mln dlrs
  through brokers and the rest through banks. The buying began
  when the dollar was at about 149.60 yen, and helped drive the
  U.S. Currency up to around 150, he said.
      Another said the central bank seemed to be trying to push
  the dollar up above 150 yen. But heavy selling at around that
  level quickly pushed the dollar back down towards 149 yen,
  dealers said.
