HUMANA &lt;HUM> DECLARES SHAREHOLDERS RIGHTS PLAN
  Humana Inc said its board
  approved a shareholder rights plan, or so-called poison pill
  plan, to ensure its shareholders receive fair treatment in the
  event of a proposed takeover.
      Humana said it is now aware of any effort to gain control
  of the company.
      Under the plan its board declared a dividend distribution
  of one right for each outstanding common share held as of March
  16. It said each right entitles holders to purchase a unit of
  1/100 of a share of newly authorizes series A participating
  preferred at 75 dlrs per unit.
      Humana said the rights become effective after an entity
  acquires 20 pct or more of its outstanding common or tenders
  for 30 pct of its stock. After such an acquisition, then each
  right entitles holders to purchase securities of the company or
  an acquiring entity having a market value of twice the right's
  exercise price.
      Humana said the rights expire March 4, 1997, unless
  redeemed earlier. It said the rights may be redeemed by the
  company for one ct per right at any time prior to 10 days
  following a public announcement that a 20 pct position has been
  acquired.
