U.S. EEP VEG OIL PROPOSALS STILL UNDER REVIEW
  U.S. Agriculture Department
  proposals to offer 260,000 tonnes of subsidized vegetable oil
  to four countries are still under consideration by an
  interagency trade policy group, a USDA official close to the
  group said.
      The official, who asked not to be identified, dismissed a
  report circulating in markets today that the interagency trade
  policy review group had rejected the proposals.
      Under the proposals, USDA would offer vegetable oil under
  the export enhancement program, EEP, to four countries,
  including 80,000 tonnes to Turkey and 60,000 tonnes to Algeria,
  Morocco and Tunisia, industry sources said.
      The proposals "are still under review" by the interagency
  working group, the USDA official said.
