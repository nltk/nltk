COPPER MEETING AGREES GOALS OF STUDY GROUP
  The world's major copper producing and
  consuming countries have reached "a degree of consensus" on
  objectives and functions of a future study group aimed at
  reviewing the world copper market, officials said.
      Governments represented at a meeting to consider a proposed
  forum for copper have recommended that another session be held
  in September to consider further the nature of such a group, a
  spokesman for the United Nations Conference on Trade and
  Development (UNCTAD) said.
      The one-week meeting, which ended today, was held to
  examine a U.S. Initiative to set up a copper study group.
      The new body would not aim at negotiating measures to
  stabilise depressed world prices.
      Its objectives would include increasing market
  transparency, through improved statistics, and undertaking
  activities aimed at developing the copper market and
  contributing to improvement of demand.
      UNCTAD's spokesman said, "Once they have agreed on detailed
  functions and objectives, then the way will be cleared to
  setting up the body."
