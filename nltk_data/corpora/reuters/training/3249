DUTCH CURRENT ACCOUNT SURPLUS FALLS IN 1986
  The Dutch current account surplus fell
  5.4 billion guilders last year to a provisional 12.1 billion
  guilders, the Finance Ministry said in a statement.
      The surplus is expected to fall further in 1987, the
  statement said, but gave no details. Earlier today, the
  official planning agency CPB said it expected the surplus to
  fall to six billion guilders during 1987.
      The visible goods surplus excluding energy fell by 5.6
  billion guilders in 1986 to 11.4 billion due to declining terms
  of exchange, while more goods were imported as consumer
  spending and investment increased.
      While the energy trade balance surplus rose by 5.4 billion
  guilders, 4.7 billion of this gain was caused by temporary
  improvements of terms of exchange and was aided by the delay
  between the fall in oil and gas prices.
      The current account showed a 5.2 billion guilder deficit on
  invisibles, compared with a balance in 1985, the Finance
  Ministry said, noting the surplus on transport services was
  reduced substantially due to the lower dollar and oil price
  falls.
      The fourth quarter current account showed a deficit, for
  the first time since 1980, of 700 mln guilders, it said.
