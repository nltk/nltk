CLABIR &lt;CLG> DIVIDENDS NOT TAXABLE
  Clabir Corp said it has
  determined all dividends paid on its Class A common in 1986 are
  not taxable as dividend income.
      While this is a preliminary estimate, the company said, it
  may be used by shareholders when preparing 1986 income tax
  returns.
