PAKISTAN COULD IMPORT 100,000 TONNES OF PALM OIL
  Pakistan is likely to import 100,000
  tonnes of refined, bleached and deodorised palm oil between
  April and June this year, vegetable oil dealers said.
      They said the import would be financed by the Islamic
  Development Bank (IDB) which signed an agreement with Pakistan
  earlier this week in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.
      Pakistan had imported 600,000 tonnes of edible oil since
  the beginning of the current financial year last July, they
  added. The palm oil would come from Malaysia or Indonesia.
