JAPAN CONSUMER PRICES UNCHANGED IN FEBRUARY
  Japan's consumer price index (base 1985)
  was unchanged at 99.7 in February from a month earlier, the
  government's Management and Coodination Agency said.
      The index showed a 0.4 pct drop in January.
      The February index was down one pct from a year earlier for
  the third consecutive year-on-year drop.
      In January, the index fell 1.1 pct from a year earlier, the
  first drop of over one pct since a 1.3 pct drop in September
  1958.
      In February petrol prices increased but winter clothing
  prices stayed low and vegetable prices fell.
      The February year on year fall was due to lower vegetable,
  fuel oil, petrol, electricity and gas prices, and despite
  higher housing, education, footwear and clothing costs.
      The unadjusted consumer price index for the Tokyo area
  (base 1985) in mid-March rose 0.4 pct from a month earlier to
  100.6, reflecting higher vegetable prices.
      The index fell 0.3 pct year on year, the third consecutive
  yearly drop, reflecting lower food and utility costs.
