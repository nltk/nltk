GREYHOUND &lt;G> BUYS GENERAL MOTORS &lt;GM> BUS UNIT
  Greyhound Corp said it has
  signed a definitive agreement to buy General Motors Corp's U.S.
  Transit Bus and Parts business for an undisclosed sum.
      The agreement, tentatively set in January, includes
  production tooling, design and equipment for urban transit
  buses, inventories and trademark identification.
      The agreement also incudes the right to buy GM's Canadian
  Transit Bus and Parts business, contingent on a satisfactory
  labor agreement.
      Greyhound said it will relocate the production facilities,
  currently in Pontiac, Michigan, to an undetermined location.
