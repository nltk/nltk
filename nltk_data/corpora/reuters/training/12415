SUGAR OFFERED TO DUTCH INTERVENTION REFUSED
  The 2,500 tonnes of sugar offered to
  intervention in the Netherlands has been refused by the
  intervention board because of wrong packaging, a spokeswoman
  for the Ministry of Agriculture said.
      She said the sugar could be offered again to intervention.
      EC producers have threatened to sell over 800,000 tonnes of
  sugar to intervention stocks as a protest against EC export
  licensing policies.
      Last month Dutch traders said the sugar on offer in the
  Netherlands was Belgian, but the ministry could not confirm
  this.
