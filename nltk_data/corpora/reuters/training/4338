FN RESULTS HIT BY STRIKES, DOLLAR IN 1986
  Fabrique Nationale Herstal SA
  &lt;FNHB.BR> said it suffered a net loss of 2.99 billion francs
  last year after being hit by strikes, the falling dollar and
  declining oil prices.
      An FN statement said the loss, which compared with a 6.8
  mln franc profit the previous year, included considerable
  charges for restructuring in 1986 and 1987. Without these the
  net loss would have been 1.45 billion francs, it said.
      It added that the restructuring plan would allow the firm
  to return to long term profitability once it had been approved
  by local authorities, banks and the workforce.
