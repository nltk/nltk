LYNG SAYS NO DECISIONS TAKEN AT CABINET COUNCIL
  U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
  Lyng said no decisions were taken today at a White House
  Economic Policy Council meeting.
      Speaking to reporters on his return from the meeting, Lyng
  said only about five minutes of the session dealt with
  agriculture issues.
      "It was not a decision making meeting," Lyng said.
      Aides to Lyng earlier said the administration's agriculture
  legislative proposals would be the farm-related topic on the
  agenda. Lyng would not comment on what farm issues were
  discussed.
      Asked how he would respond to farm groups and Congressmen
  urging the U.S. to offer a wheat bonus to the Soviet Union,
  Lyng said he would be listen but be "non-committal."
