INDONESIA PLANS TO BUILD PALM OIL TERMINAL
  Indonesia will build a crude palm oil
  terminal at a new port on Batam island, south of Singapore,
  Research and Technology Minister Yusuf Habibie said.
      The terminal will be able to handle 2.1 mln tonnes of crude
  palm oil from new plantations in northern Sumatra and western
  Kalimantan (Borneo), he said.
      A tender for engineering work on the Asia Port project will
  be offered mid-year. Habibie did not say when the terminal was
  expected to be operational.
