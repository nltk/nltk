BLIZZARD CLOSES BOSPHORUS
  Blizzard conditions halted shipping
  through the Bosphorus waterway and piled snow up to 70 cms deep
  in central Istanbul, paralysing the city for the second day
  running.
      Snow whipped by 48 kph winds continued to fall on Istanbul
  and northwest Anatolia after 36 hours and weather reports
  predicted no relief for another two days.
      Port officials said at least six large vessels in the Black
  Sea and 13 in the Sea of Marmara were waiting for conditions to
  improve.
      Istanbul's Ataturk international airport has been closed
  since yesterday.
