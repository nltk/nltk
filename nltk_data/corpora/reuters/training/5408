EEP SHOULD BE USED TACTICALLY, YEUTTER SAYS
  U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
  Yeutter said the Export Enhancement Program, EEP, should be
  used as a "tactical tool" and not as a general policy.
      Yeutter made the comment in response to a question whether
  the U.S. should expand the EEP to cover grain sales to the
  Soviet Union.
      He did not comment directly on the Soviet question,
  replying that any decision would be made at the highest levels
  of the Reagan administration, and "I don't want to preempt that."
      Yeutter told the National Grain and Feed Association EEP
  should continue to be used as a tactical tool against the
  European Community but not as a general policy. He said
  selective EEP use has been successful in pressuring the E.C.
