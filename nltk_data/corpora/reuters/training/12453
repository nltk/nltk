U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN 345 MLN STG ASSISTANCE
  The Bank of England said it had provided
  the money market with 345 mln stg help in the morning session.
  This compares with its forecast of a shortage of around 800 mln
  stg in the system today.
      The central bank made outright purchases of bank bills
  comprising 58 mln stg in band one at 9-7/8 pct, 227 mln stg in
  band two at 9-13/16 pct, 56 mln stg in band three at 9-3/4 pct
  and four mln stg in band four at 9-11/16 pct.
      Dealers noted that this was the first time bills in band
  four, which have a maturity of between two and three months,
  have been dealt in the market since mid-February.
