SENS. DANFORTH, BOND ASK TARGETED 0/92 MEASURE
  Missouri Republican Senators John
  Danforth and Christopher Bond have introduced a bill that would
  allow wheat and feedgrain producers along the Mississippi and
  Missouri Rivers hurt by flooding last year to collect at least
  92 pct of their deficiency payments this year without planting.
      Danforth aide Austin Schlick said the bill was similar to a
  provision included in a House Agriculture Committee-passed
  emergency disaster assistance bill scheduled to be taken up by
  the House tomorrow.
      Schlick said flooding destroyed a number of levees along
  the two rivers last October, leaving farmland there vulnerable
  to further damage this year.
