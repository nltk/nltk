TAIWAN ISSUES MORE CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT
  Taiwan's central bank issued 12 billion
  Taiwan dlrs worth of certificates of deposit after issuing six
  billion yesterday, bringing CD issues so far this year to
  115.47 billion dlrs, a bank official told Reuters.
      The new CDs have maturities of six months, one year and two
  years and bear interest rates ranging from 4.07 pct to 5.12
  pct, he said.
      The issues are aimed at helping curb the growth of M-1b
  money supply, which is the result of large foreign exchange
  reserves. The reserves now total more than 51 billion U.S.
  Dlrs.
