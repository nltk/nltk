FORD &lt;F> SHARES RISE ON HIGHER EARNING ESTIMATE
  Ford Motor Co's stock rose 1-1/4 to
  82-1/4 after analyst Maryann Keller of Furman Selz Mager Dietz
  and Birney raised earnings estimates on the company, traders
  said.
      Keller said that she expects the company's 1987 earnings to
  rise to between 13.50-to-14 dlrs a share as compared to 12.32
  dlrs a share earned last year.
      She said Ford's already good market share is expected to
  remain favorable and earnings from overseas are expected to
  improve.
      In addition, Keller said, the company is selling more of
  its expensive model cars, which are more profitable.
      The non-automotive operations, including Ford Motor Credit,
  are also expected to post improved earnings this year.
      Keller said she expects the company to split its stock and
  raise its dividend to at least three dlrs a share this year.
      She noted that Chrysler Corp's &lt;C> announcement of a merger
  proposal for American Motors Corp &lt;AMO> should have no short
  term effect on Ford but could cut into Ford's share of the
  truck market in the long term.
