NEW DUTCH SPECIAL ADVANCES ANNOUNCED AT 5.3 PCT
  The Dutch central bank announced new
  eleven-day special advances at an unchanged 5.3 pct to aid
  money market liquidity, covering the period March 9 to 20.
      The amount will be set at tender on Monday March 9 between
  0800 and 0830 GMT. The new facility will replace the current
  4.8 billion guilders of seven-day advances expiring Monday.
      Money dealers estimated today's money market shortage at 11
  to 11.25 billion guilders, barely changed from yesterday.
      They said call money was still relatively high at 6-1/8 to
  6-1/4 pct as a result of the tight set of bids accepted by the
  Bank for the previous seven-day facility.
