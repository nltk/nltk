K MART &lt;KM> ENDS TALKS TO SELL STORES
  K Mart Corp said recent talks to sell
  65 remaining Kresge variety stores and their underlying real
  estate to F.W. Woolworth Co &lt;Z> have ended.
      Robert Stevenson, K Mart vice president, told Reuters the
  talks, which began about six weeks ago, ended. He declined to
  give a reason.
      Kresge is the forerunner of what is now the K Mart chain.
  The name was changed to K Mart in 1977, Stevenson said.
      "We're selling and buying real estate in our real estate
  division, and Woolworth was interested in some of our
  properties. The talks were of a casual nature," he said.
      The 65 Kresge stores that are scattered around the country
  in downtown and suburban locations, he said.
      Stevenson said K Mart will continue to operate the stores.
  "The stores are profitable. The only decision K Mart has made
  is that we will continue to operate them," he said
      Kresge had been a nationwide chain of 900 variety stores.
