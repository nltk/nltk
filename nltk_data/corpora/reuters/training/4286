  The flavours and
  fragrances firm &lt;Naarden International N.V.>, acquired by
  Anglo-Dutch food and detergents group Unilever Plc N.V. &lt;UN.AS>
  last year, said net profits for 1986 fell 11.4 pct to 19.5 mln
  guilders.

  both the dollar and sterling, noting the figure was in line
  with prior expectations. Net profit was 22.0 mln guilders in
  1985.
      Earnings per share fell to 4.64 guilders from 5.48 in 1985

  cash dividend of 1.80 guilders, unchanged from last year but
