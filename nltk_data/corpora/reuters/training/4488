WEINBERGER OPPOSES FUJITSU BUYING U.S. FIRM
  Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger
  will join Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige in fighting
  Fujitsu Ltd's &lt;ITSU.T> plan to buy 80 pct of &lt;Fairchild
  Semiconductor Corp>, Pentagon officials said.
      "He (Weinberger) opposes it. It is not in the best interests
  of the country to have more of the micro-electronics business
  leaving the United States," one of the Pentagon officials, who
  asked not to be identified, told Reuters.
      Commerce Department officials told Reuters yesterday that
  Baldrige opposed the planned sale and that the White House
  Economic Policy Council will take up the matter within weeks.
      Commerce and defense officials said Baldrige and Weinberger
  feared the U.S. military is already leaning too heavily on
  foreign electronic support.
      But the Defense Department also said today that Weinberger
  and Baldrige differed on the proposed sale of U.S. computer
  equipment to Iran.
      The Commerce Department advised the Pentagon recently that
  defense objections to two proposed sales -- to an Iranian power
  company and the Islamic Republic of Iran News Agency -- were
  not valid and the sales of small and medium computers would go
  through unless more evidence was presented.
