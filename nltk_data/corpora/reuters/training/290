ICO TALKS ON COFFEE QUOTAS TO RESUME AT NOON
  Talks on coffee export quotas at the
  International Coffee Organization (ICO) special council session
  will resume at noon gmt today, following a last minute decision
  taken early this morning to extend the meeting 24 hours, ICO
  officials said.
      An 18 member contact group will meet at midday to examine
  new ideas, and the full council is to convene at 1900gmt, they
  said.
      The extension resulted from a last ditch effort by Colombia
  to salvage the talks, which by late yesterday looked perilously
  close to ending without agreement on quotas, delegates said.
