ELECTROMEDICS &lt;ELMD> TO TAKE 1ST QTR CHARGE
  Electromedics Inc said it
  expects to take a 150,000 dlr charge against first quarter
  results due to the conversion of debentures.
      The company said, however, it expects "positive" operating
  comparisons for the period.  Electromedics lost 6,000 dlrs in
  last year's first quarter.
