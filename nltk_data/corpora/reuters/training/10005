U.K. GROWING IMPATIENT WITH JAPAN - THATCHER
  Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said
  the U.K. Was growing more impatient with Japanese trade
  barriers and warned that it would soon have new powers against
  countries not offering reciprocal access to their markets.
      She told Parliament that the bid by the U.K.'s Cable and
  Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L> to enter the Japanese telecommunications
  market was being regarded by her government as a test case.
      "I wrote to the prime minister of Japan, Mr Nakasone, on the
  fourth of March to express our interest on the Cable and
  Wireless bid. I have not yet had a reply. We see this as a test
  on how open the Japanese market really is," Thatcher said.
      Thatcher told Parliament that "shortly ... We shall have
  more powers than we have now, when, for example the powers
  under the Financial Services Act and the Banking Act become
  available, then we shall be able to take action in cases where
  other countries do not offer the same full access to financial
  services as we do."
      Cable and Wireless is seeking a stake in the proposed
  Japanese telecommunications rival to Kokusai Denshin Denwa.
      But the Japanese minister for post and telecommunications
  was reported as saying that he opposed Cable and Wireless
  having a managerial role in the new company.
