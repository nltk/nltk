COCA COLA &lt;KO> SAYS RUMORS INCORRECT
  A Coca Cola Co spokesman said rumors
  the company is interested in acquiring Wendy's International
  &lt;WEN> are not true.
      "Those rumors are not correct," said Carlton Curtis, an
  assistant vice president at Coke. "We have stated many times
  that Coca Cola Co has no interest in an acquisition in the food
  service industry and thereby becoming a competitor to our food
  service customers."
      Wendy's stock has been flying high on the rumors for two
  days. Today, Wendy's hit a high of 13-3/8 before dropping back
  to 12-3/8, up 5/8 in heavy trading.
