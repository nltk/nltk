  well 39 miles east of Galeota Point on Trinidad's east coast
  flowed 24 mln cubic feet of natural gas and 500 barrels of
  condensate daily from one zone and 29 mln cubic feet of natural
  gas and 600 barrels of condensate daily from a second.
      The company said both flows were through 40/64 inch chokes

  well, in 260 feet of water, was drilled to a total depth of
  14,629 feet, it said.  It said the discovery was made in sands
