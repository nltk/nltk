AUSTRALIAN UNIONS LAUNCH NEW SOUTH WALES STRIKES
  Australian trade unions said they have
  launched week-long strikes and other industrial action in New
  South Wales (NSW) to protest against new laws that would reduce
  injury compensation payments.
      Union sources said talks with the state government broke
  down last night, but the two sides are scheduled to meet later
  today in an attempt to find a compromise.
      Rail freight and shipping cargo movements in the country's
  most populous state were the first to be affected, and union
  officials said almost every business sector will be hit unless
  there is a quick settlement.
      The state government recently introduced a new workers'
  compensation act which would cut the cash benefits to injured
  workers by up to a third. The act is now awaiting parliamentary
  ratification.
      NSW state premier Barrie Unsworth has said workers'
  compensation has risen steeply in recent years and the proposed
  cuts would save hundreds of mlns of dollars a year.
      Union officials said industrial action could spread to
  other states as the federal government also plans to make sharp
  cuts in workers' compensation.
