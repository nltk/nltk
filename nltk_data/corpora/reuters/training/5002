COLOMBIA OPENS APRIL/MAY COFFEE REGISTRATIONS
  Colombia opened coffee export
  registrations for April and May with the National Coffee
  Growers' Federation setting no limit, Gilberto Arango,
  president of the private exporters' association, said.
      He told Reuters the decision not to put any limit responded
  to "new factors" which have emerged from recent International
  Coffee Organisation talks in London, where producers and
  consumers failed to agree on a re-introduction of export quotas.
