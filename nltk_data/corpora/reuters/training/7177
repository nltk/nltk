U.K. REVISES RETAIL PRICE INDEX FROM FEBRUARY
  The U.K. Government tomorrow will
  release the first of its Retail Price Index (RPI) figures
  calculated on a revised group of components and rebased on
  January 1987, as previously announced, the Employment
  Department said.
      The index, Britain's measure of inflation, is for February.
  Earlier data will not be revised as there are no equivalent
  figures including the new components, a spokesman said.
      Previously, the RPI base was January, 1974.
      Market forecasts centre on a 0.4-0.5 pct monthly rise in
  February and a year on year rate about 4.0 pct. The government
  forecasts annual inflation will be 4.0 pct at the end of 1987.
