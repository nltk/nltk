ITALY SHOWS INTEREST IN U.K. NEW CROP WHEAT
  Italy has shown interest in British new
  crop wheat recently but the actual volume booked so far by
  Italian buyers has not been large, traders said.
      They put purchases at around 50,000 tonnes for Sept/Dec
  shipments but said some of the business was transacted at the
  start of the year.
      Italian interior home markets have been active in recent
  weeks and traders said around 200,000 tonnes have traded
  between dealers and home consumers. Some of this has been
  covered in the market here and more possibly will be, traders
  said.
