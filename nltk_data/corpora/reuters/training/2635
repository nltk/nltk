SOME SHIPPING RESTRICTIONS REMAIN ON RHINE
  Limited shipping restrictions due to high
  water remain in force on parts of the West German stretch of
  the Rhine river between the Dutch border and the city of Mainz
  but most are expected to be lifted this weekend.
      water authority officials said The restrictions, caused by
  high water levels, include speed limits and directives to keep
  to the middle of the river to prevent damage to the river
  banks. The high water was expected to recede within two days to
  below levels at which the restrictions come into force.
      Traffic was halted briefly late Tuesday night, Wednesday
  and parts of Thursday on stretches of the Rhine between Bonn
  and Koblenz but the shipping bans were lifted, the officials
  said. Shipping is now permitted on all parts of the West German
  section of the Rhine, with restrictions in some areas.
