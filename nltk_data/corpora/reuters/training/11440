CPL REAL ESTATE &lt;CNTRS> SEES LOWER DIVIDENDS
  CPL Real Estate Trust
  Investment said its regular quarterly dividend distribution
  will be lower than its present 26 cts per share, and could be
  significantly lower starting with the third quarter of 1987.
      The company, which lowered the payout from 27 cts to 26 cts
  this current quarter, said it did not know how low the payout
  would go.
      The company said the reason for the cutbacks was because it
  would not be purchasing a property it had anticipated, and
  alternative investments will produce significantly lower yields
  than anticipated.
