FED EXPECTED TO ADD TEMPORARY RESERVES
  The Federal Reserve is expected to
  enter the U.S. Government securities market to add temporary
  reserves, economists said.
      They expect it to supply the reserves indirectly by
  arranging around 1.5 of customer repurchase agreements.
      Federal funds, which averaged 6.22 pct yesterday, opened at
  six pct and remained there in early trading.
