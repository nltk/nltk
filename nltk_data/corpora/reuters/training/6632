LATIN COFFEE MEETING TO BE HELD IN MANAGUA
  Representatives from Brazil, Colombia,
  Mexico and Nicaragua will meet here Friday to discuss the
  economic impact of falling coffee prices, a Nicaraguan official
  announced.
      Vice-minister of foreign trade Bernardo Chamorro said that
  participating in the meeting will be the heads of the coffee
  associations from the four countries.
      He did not say if the meeting would continue beyond friday.
      Chamorro said Nicaragua supports the establishment of
  export quotas in an effort to boost sagging world prices.
