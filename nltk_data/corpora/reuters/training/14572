WESTMIN TO RAISE MYRA FALLS CAPACITY BY 33 PCT
  Westmin Resources Ltd said it
  plans to increase capacity at its Myra Falls, British Columbia,
  base and precious metal mine and mill complex by 33 pct to
  4,400 short tons of ore a day, subject to regulatory approvals.
      The company said the expansion will cost about 24 mln dlrs
  and could be in operation by 1988.
      Economies of scale from the expansion should pay back net
  expansion cost in less than one year, Westmin said.
      The Myra Falls complex processed 3,257 tons of ore a day
  during 1986. Myra Falls 1986 production was 44,000 ounces of
  gold, 966,266 ounces of silver, 45.5 mln lbs of copper, 96.2
  mln lbs of zinc and 777,000 lbs of lead, a company spokesman
  said.
