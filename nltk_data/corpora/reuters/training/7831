COOPER &lt;CBE> ASKS FTC TO END ACQUISITION LIMITS
  Cooper Industries Inc asked the
  Federal Trade Commission to vacate a 1979 order that requires
  the company to get FTC approval before making certain
  acquisitions, the FTC said.
      The order was issued as part of a settlement of FTC charges
  that Cooper's merger with Gardner-Denver Co would lessen
  competion and increase concentration in the gas compressor and
  industrial air tool industries, the FTC said.
      The order requires that, until 1989, Cooper must get FTC
  approval before acquiring companies in the natural gas
  compressor or hand-held industrial pneumatic tool businesses.
