USDA REPORTS 10.572 MLN ACRES IN CONSERVATION
  The U.S. Agriculture Department has
  accepted 10,572,402 more acres of highly erodable cropland into
  the Conservation Reserve Program, USDA announced.
      In the latest signup, farmers on 101,020 farms submitted
  bids on a total of 11,254,837 acres.
      The accepted bids for annual rental payments ranged up to
  90 dlrs per acre with an average of 51.17 dlrs per acre.
      Land entered into the Conservation Reserve Program will be
  ineligible for farming for ten years and must be planted with
  permanent vegetative cover.
      Producers enrolled 1,894,764 acres of corn base acreage in
  the conservation program to take advantage of a corn "bonus"
  rental payment that was offered by USDA.
      The corn bonus, to be paid in generic comodity
  certificates, amounts to two dlrs per bushel, based on the ASCS
  program payment yield for corn, for each acre of corn based
  accepted into the reserve.
