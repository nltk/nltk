SIEMENS REBUTTS U.S. CRITICISM ON CGCT OFFER
  Siemens AG &lt;SIEG.F> rebutted U.S.
  Criticism it is blocking American Telephone and Telegraph
  Corp's &lt;T.N>, AT and T, entry into French telecommunications
  firm &lt;Compagnie Generale Constructions Telephoniques>, CGCT.
      Management board member Hans Baur told journalists that the
  acquisition of a joint 20 pct stake in CGCT by AT and T and
  Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken NV &lt;PGLO.AS> had not been decided
  on two years ago as claimed by AT and T.
      The French government, which owns CGCT, had asked Siemens
  at the start of 1986 to submit an offer for the stake in CGCT.
  The result of the negotiations was still open.
      Baur said Siemens had first made an offer last summer.
      The Handelsblatt newspaper today quoted AT and T chairman
  James E. Olson as saying that Siemens' attempt to stop AT and T
  and Philips could lead to a resurgence of protectionism in the
  U.S.
      Baur said he expected the French government to decide on
  the winning bid by the end of April. CGCT's share of the French
  switchboard market amounts to around 16 pct.
      The French government has limited CGCT participation by
  foreign companies to 20 pct and set a price of 500 mln francs
  for the whole company.
      Bauer said the 20 pct limitation would only apply to the
  initial stake. He did not rule out a stake increase later but
  said Siemens' aim was to introduce its technology.
      Bauer said Siemens and French telecommunications firm
  &lt;Jeumont-Schneider SA> submitted a joint offer at the start of
  March because of the 20 pct limitation. Both companies will
  form a joint venture to take over the whole of CGCT.
     Siemens will have a 20 pct stake in the new company while
  Jeumont-Schneider will own 80 pct. Apart from investing 100 mln
  francs for the modernisation of CGCT, a new research centre
  with was also being planned.
