STRUTHERS WELLS &lt;SUW> SEES 1986 NOV 30 LOSS
  Struthers Wells Corp said it expects
  to report a loss, without tax benefit, of about 16 mln dlrs for
  the fiscal year ended November 30, 1986, versus a profit of
  295,000 dlrs in fiscal 1985.
      The company added, however, that about 13.6 mln dlrs of the
  loss relates to discontinued operations and disposal of
  subsidiaries.
      The company said the loss is part of its previously
  announced restructuring that includes the sale of its foreign
  and domestic units.
      Struthers added that it has filed with the Securities and
  Exchange Commission for an extension to file its annual report
  on form 10-K as a result of delays caused by the restructuring.
