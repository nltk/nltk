FED EXPECTED TO SET CUSTOMER REPURCHASES
  The Federal Reserve is expected to
  intervene in the government securities market to supply
  temporary reserves indirectly via customer repurchase
  agreements, economists said.
      They said the Fed is expected to execute anywhere from
  1.5-2.0 billion dlrs of customer repos to offset seasonal
  pressures on bank reserves.
      Federal funds, which averaged 6.20 pct yesterday, opened at
  6-1/8 pct and remained there in early trading.
