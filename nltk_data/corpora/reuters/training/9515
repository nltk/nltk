TREASURY'S BAKER OUTLINES TRADE BILL CRITICISMS
  Treasury Secretary James Baker said
  that some of the trade bills proposed by Congress conflict
  significantly with certain basic principles the Reagan
  administration considers critical.
      Baker told a Senate committee that the administration would
  resist such measures as a general import surcharge,
  sector-specific protection such as import quotas for individual
  products, mandatory retaliation, and limits on presidential
  discretion in negotiating more open markets abroad and other
  trade steps.
