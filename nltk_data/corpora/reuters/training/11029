BASS GROUP SAYS IT HAS HAD TALKS ON TAFT &lt;TFB>
  A group led by members of the
  wealthy Bass family of Fort Worth, Texas, which holds a 24.9
  pct stake in Taft Broadcasting Co, said it has had talks about
  taking part in a move to take control of the company.
      In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
  the group said it has had discussions with other Taft
  stockholders and some company managers and directors
  "concerning participation in a group to acquire control" of the
  company.
      The Bass group, which did not identify any of the other
  people with whom it said it has had talks, said it plans to
  continue evaluating Taft and "will be involved in further
  discussions relating to the future control and direction" of
  the company.
      The group, which holds 2,291,210 Taft common shares, said
  its members may buy more shares of Taft common stock, or may
  decide to sell some or all of its stake.
      On Friday Taft said it would negotiate with a group led by
  its vice chairman, Dudley Taft, and a Rhode Island investment
  firm, which had offered 150 dlrs a share for the company.
      The Dudley Taft group, Theta Corp, which also includes
  Narragansett Capital Corp, a Providence, R.I., investment firm,
  is seeking to take the company private in a leveraged buyout
  valued at 1.38 billion dlrs.
      Besides the Bass group, another major Taft shareholder,
  Cincinnati, Ohio, financier Carl Lindner, has also said he has
  had talks about increasing his stake in the company, taking
  part in a takeover effort, or launching one himself.
      Lindner controls 1,489,298 shares of Taft common stock, or
  16.2 pct of the total.
