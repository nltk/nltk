YEUTTER CONCERNED ABOUT U.S. EXPORT PICTURE
  U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
  Yeutter said he expects imports to fall soon but he was
  concerned about the lack of improvement in U.S. exports given
  the dollar's decline in the last 18 months.
      "I'm convinced we're about to see an improvement on the
  import side. I'm more concerned about the export side," he told
  a House Appropriations subcommittee.
      Part of the blame goes on other countries which have not
  generated the economic growth to increase demand for U.S. goods
  and part to some U.S. companies which are not generating
  competitive exports, he said.
