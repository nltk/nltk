BRITISH, FRENCH MINISTERS DISCUSS PUBLIC SPENDING
  French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur
  discussed the need to control public spending in talks here
  today with British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, a
  Treasury spokesman said.
      The spokesman said the ministers reviewed their economies,
  and public spending, domestic and European Community-wide.
      He declined to comment on whether the subject of concerted
  action to shore up the dollar had arisen. The U.S. Currency
  dipped sharply earlier this week after a month of relative
  stability after an agreement by six major industrialised
  nations in Paris on February 22 to stabilise their currencies.
