LYNG TO MEET WITH EXPORTERS, EEP LIKELY TOPIC
  Secretary of Agriculture Richard
  Lyng will meet with representatives from major grain exporting
  companies today, and the subject of subsidized wheat to the
  Soviet Union will likely be discussed, an aide to Lyng said.
      Today's meeting, set to begin at 1500 EST (2000 gmt), was
  scheduled at the request of the exporters, the aide said.
      "The EEP (export enhancement program) is pretty obviously
  one of the things they (the exporters) want to talk about, but
  they haven't any agenda as far as I know," Lyng's aide said.
      Private industry export officials have met periodically
  with Lyng to discuss farm policies and the export situation.
  Whether this meeting will prompt any U.S. action on the issue
  of whether Moscow will be offered export bonus wheat is
  uncertain, the aide said.
      "I don't know what they'll tell us that we don't already
  knwo, but we'll hear what they have to say," Lyng's aide said.
      The USDA official said that as far as he knows there has
  been no further action on offering the Soviet Union wheat under
  the EEP.
