MARK IV CORRECTS AGREEMENT WITH BAIRD &lt;BATM>
  Mark IV Industries Inc &lt;IV>, which
  has said it may consider a bid to seek control of Baird Corp,
  said Baird has not agreed to hold off on any defensive measures
  without giving Mark IV at least 24 hours notice.
      In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
  Mark IV corrected a statement it made yesterday in another SEC
  filing in which it listed several agreements reached with
  Baird, including that Baird would not take any anti-takeover
  steps without providing at least 24 hours notice.
      Mark IV said it was later told by Baird that Baird had
  given no such assurance.
