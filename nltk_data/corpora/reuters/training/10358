BANK OF FRANCE AGAIN BUYING DOLLARS, SOURCES SAY
  The Bank of France intervened in the
  Paris foreign exchange market this morning for the third
  successive day, banking sources said.
      Like yesterday, it bought dollars and sold yen in small
  amounts, they said.
      One dealer said it was seen in the market twice in early
  dealing, buying five mln dlrs each time.
      Other dealers also reported small-scale intervention to
  stabilise the dollar after aggressive selling overnight in
  Tokyo, where the Bank of Japan also intervened again.
      The dollar steadied at around 6.0650/0700 francs after
  easing in early trading to 6.0615/35 from an opening 6.0700/50.
  It closed yesterday at 6.0800/30.
      One major french bank said it bought 10 mln dlrs for the
  central bank, selling yen, within a trading range of 148.20/30
  yen to the dollar, compared with yesterday's 149.28 rate at
  which intervention was carried out here.
      The yen later firmed to around 147.90/148.00.
