BIFFEX MEMBERS TO BALLOT ON MERGER
  Members of the Baltic International
  Freight Futures Exchange (BIFFEX) are to be balloted at the end
  of this week on whether it will merge with the London Commodity
  Exchange or come under a new umbrella of Baltic futures
  exchanges, a BIFFEX official said.
      The final decision will be left with the BIFFEX board,
  which will meet at the end of this month, he said.
      Last week three exchanges currently trading on the Baltic
  Exchange, the London Potato Futures Association, the GAFTA Soya
  Bean Meal Futures Association and the London Meat Futures
  Exchange, instructed legal advisers to implement a merger.
