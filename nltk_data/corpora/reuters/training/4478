USDA SAYS WHEAT PURCHASED FROM FOREIGN SELLERS
  The U.S. Agriculture Department said
  private U.S. exporters reported purchases from foreign sellers
  of 120,000 tonnes of wheat for delivery to unknown
  destinations.
      The wheat, consisting of 60,000 tonnes of hard red winter
  and 60,000 tones of soft red winter, is for delivery during the
  1987/88 season, which begins June 1.
      A purchase from a foreign seller is a transaction in which
  a U.S. exporter contracts to buy U.S.-produced commodities from
  a foreign firm, the department said.
