HEALTHMATE &lt;HMTE> EXPECTS QUALIFIED OPINION
  HealthMate Inc said its
  auditors, Laventhol and Horwath, indicated they will issue a
  qualified opinion on the company's financial statements.
      The company, which went public in March 1985, earlier
  reported losses for the fourth quarter.
      It said the auditor's statement, known as a "subject to"
  opinion, cautions that, because of continuing operating losses
  and negative cash flow, it must achieve profitable operations
  or acquire additional equity capital or other financing to
  continue in existence.
      HealthMate reported a loss for the year of 1,512,534 dlrs,
  or 17 cts a share on revenues of 1.4 mln dlrs. A year ago, it
  had a loss of 1,553,592 dlrs, or 20 cts a share on revenues of
  515,225 dlrs.
      It said the increased sales reflect initial shipments of
  its FluoroScan Imaging Systems, low radiation X-ray imaging
  devices that recently were classified by Underwriters
  Laboratories Inc.
