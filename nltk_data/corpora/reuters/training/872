JAPANESE ECONOMIST SEES STABLE YEN/DOLLAR RATES
  The yen should stabilize at around
  152 to 153 to the U.S. Dollar for about a year, the Bank of
  Tokyo's economic adviser Koei Narusawa said.
      "Both sides are showing clear interest to secure stability
  of the currencies. The major target of the Japanese government
  is to maintain the yen at above 150, at least for the rest of
  the year," he told reporters during a brief visit to Malaysia.
      Narusawa said the U.S. Is unlikely to push the yen up
  further because this might spark off inflation and depress the
  U.S. Economy before the 1988 presidential election.
      The yen is trading at around 153.70 to the dollar.
