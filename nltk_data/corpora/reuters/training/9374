NY TRADERS SAY TURKEY MADE LARGE SUGAR PURCHASE
  Turkey bought an estimated 100,000
  tonnes of white sugar from three trade houses today for April
  to June shipment, according to trade sources.
      They said a large U.K. trade house sold 50,000 tonnes, a
  U.S. house traded 25,000 tonnes, and a Swiss-based dealer house
  25,000 tonnes.
      Price details were unclear but reports this morning
  suggested that Turkey was offered sugar at prices ranging down
  to 212 dlrs a tonne, c and f basis.
