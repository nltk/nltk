  Bell Petroleum Services Inc said
  Regal International Inc has doubled its offer for Bell stock to
  one Regal share for each Bell share from half a share
  previously.
      The company said it is seriously considering the new offer
  but has also received an expression of interest for a possible
  merger into a Fortune 500 company it did not identify that will
  be investigated at meetings to be held later this week.
      It said it will explore all possibilities before
  recommending a final course of action.
