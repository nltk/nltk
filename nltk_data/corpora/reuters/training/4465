ALLEGHNEY INTERNATIONAL &lt;AG> FACES ADDED COUNT
  Alleghney International Inc said the
  plaintiffs in the existing lawsuits opposing its sale requested
  an amendment to their complaint to include a class action
  count.
      Alleghney said the suit, filed in the U.S. District Court
  for the Western District of Pennsylvania, was aimed at blocking
  the sale of Alleghney to an affiliate of First Boston Inc.
      Allegheney said the additional count sought by the
  plaintiffs alleges the price to be offered for AI's common
  stock, 24.60 dlrs, is grossly unfair and one the purposes of
  the proposed sale is to absolve the individual defendants of
  liability in the lawsuit.
       The additional count among other forms of relief, requests
  an injunction against the defendants from taking any steps to
  accomplish the proposed sale, Alleghney said.
