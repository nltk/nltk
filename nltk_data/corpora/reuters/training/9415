BALDRIGE SAYS JAPAN MUST OPEN ITS MARKETS
  Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige
  said the United States will not stand idly by and let Japan
  dominate the world electronics market.
      Baldrige told the Senate Finance Committee the United
  States would insist Japan open its markets to U.S. products as
  the U.S. market is open to Japanese products.
      Asked after his testimony if this meant the United States
  would close its markets to Japan if they did not open theirs,
  Baldrige said, "I'm not prepared to say that, but it certainly
  would be one of the alternatives studied."
      Baldrige said in his testimony Japan had a closed
  supercomputer market and a restricted telecommunications
  market.
      "I can only conclude that the common objective of the
  Japanese government and industry is to dominate the world
  electronics market. Given the importance of this market to U.S.
  industry in general and our defense base in particular, we
  cannot stand by idly," he said.
      He said it was these concerns about national security which
  led him to express reservations over the proposed acquisition
  of Fairchild Semiconductor by Fujitsu of Japan.
