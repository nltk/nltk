UNOFFICIAL STRIKE HITS ROTTERDAM GRAIN SECTOR
  About 220 men in Rotterdam port's
  grain sector stopped work this afternoon in an unofficial
  protest at the slow progress of negotiations over a new work
  practice agreement, a spokesman for the port and transport
  union FNV said.
      Negotiations between the union and employers, which are due
  to resume early next week, are currently stalemated with the
  union refusing to accept sweeping changes in working hours and
  practices in return for a 1.5 pct pay increase.
      The FNV spokesman said the action did not yet have official
  backing, but added that next week matters might be different.
