EXOTIC NEWCASTLE DISEASE IN MD/NEW YORK-USDA
  Exotic Newcastle, a highly contagious
  disease of pet birds and poultry, has been confirmed in two
  pet-bird dealer facilities in Maryland, and New York, the U.S.
  Agriculture Department said.
      The department said no domestic poultry are involved in the
  outbreak.
      State quarantines have been placed on the two facilities,
  in Hunt Valley, Maryland, and Schenectady, New York.
      The most serious U.S. outbreak of the disease occurred in
  1971-73 in southern California, where the disease spread from
  infected pet birds to a dense poultry population and nearly 12
  mln birds, mostly laying hens, were destroyed at a cost of 56
  mln dlrs, the department said.
