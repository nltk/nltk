UNION VOTES TO STRIKE DAKOTA CITY IBP PLANT
  The United Food and Commercial Workers
  union, Local 222 said its members voted Sunday to strike the
  Iowa Beef Processors Inc Dakota City, Neb., plant, effective
  Tuesday.
      The company said it submitted its latest offer to the union
  at the same time announcing that on Tuesday it would end a
  lockout that started December 14.
      Union members unanimously rejected the latest company offer
  that was submitted to the union late last week, UFCW union
  spokesman Allen Zack said.
