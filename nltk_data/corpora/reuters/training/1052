MCLEAN INDUSTRIES &lt;MII> UNIT TRANSERS SERVICE
  McLean Industries Inc said its
  shipping subsidiary, United States Lines Inc, reached an
  agreement in principle to transfer its South American service
  to American Transport Lines Inc, a subsidiary of &lt;Crowley
  Maritime Corp>.
      Under the terms of the agreement, United States Lines will
  lease five vessels to American Transport for 15 months with an
  option to extend the period up to 10 years, the company said.
      In return, U.S. Lines will receive a fixed payment and a
  percentage of revenues for at least three years and possibly as
  long as American Transport utilizes its vessels and conducts
  trade in South America, the company said.
      The companies will consummate the transactions as soon as
  the required approvals are obtained, McLean said.
