BANK OF JAPAN BUYS SMALL QUANTITY DOLLARS -DEALERS
  The Bank of Japan was thought to have
  bought a small amount of dollars at around 149.30/40 yen,
  dealers said.
      The dollar fluctuated marginally after the small-scale
  intervention, believed to total several tens of mlns of dlrs,
  they said. Large-scale buying by foreign banks or by a life
  insurance company earlier pushed the dollar upwards, they said.
      Trading was not very active and dealers were watching for
  further central bank intervention to smooth out any sharp
  movements, but underlying dollar sentiment is still bearish.
