PERU'S CENTROMIN SAYS NO COPPER FORCE MAJEURE
  Peru's biggest state mining firm,
  Centromin SA, said today there was no immediate force majeure
  possibility on its copper shipments after guerrillas blew up a
  railway line, interrupting train traffic from the Cobriza
  copper mine to the Pacific coast.
      A Centromin spokesman said the managers of the mine at
  Cobriza could always ship the the mineral by road to the coast
  for export if the train line continued interrupted. Cobriza
  produced the equivalent of around 40,600 fine tonnes of copper
  last year.
      Maoist guerrillas using dynamite interrupted train traffic
  two days ago when they blew up railway tracks and derailed a
  train laden with minerals 225 km (135 miles) east of Lima at
  Chacapalca, between the coast and Cobriza.
      An official at Minero Peru Comercial, Minpeco, Peru's state
  minerals marketing firm, confirmed there had been no
  declaration of force majeure on the shipments from Cobriza.
      Officials at National Train Company, Enafer, headquarters
  in Lima, the Peruvian capital, declined to comment on when
  train traffic would be restored to Cobriza.
      But an Enafer official, reached by telephone in the central
  Andean city of Huancayo, near Chacapalca, said traffic could be
  restored by Saturday.
