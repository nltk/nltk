CASTLE AND COOKE &lt;CKE> TAKES FOURTH QTR LOSS
  Castle and Cooke Inc said it would
  take a fourth quarter after-tax loss of 33.9 mln dlrs from the
  previously reported sale of its Flexi-Van container leasing
  business to Itel Corp &lt;ITEL> for about 215 mln dlrs.
      Earlier, the company reported a loss for the fourth quarter
  ended January 3 of 31.9 mln dlrs, or 76 cts a share, compared
  with a loss of 3.3 mln dlrs, or 21 cts per share, in 1985's
  fourth quarter.
      For the year, however, the diversified holding company
  reported a net profit of 43.9 mln dlrs, or 56 cts a share,
  versus 46.4 mln dlrs, or 56 cts a share, in 1985.
      David Murdock, chairman and chief executive officer, said,
  "Both our food business and our real estate operations
  increased their earnings during the year (1986)."
      But, he added that Flexi-Van's 1986 results were hit by
  depressed daily rental rates for leased equipment caused by
  oversupplies.
      The company also reported that George Elkas, formerly
  executive vice president,  has been named president and chief
  operating officer of Flexi-Van Corp, while William Burns has
  been named executive vice president of Flexi-Van.
