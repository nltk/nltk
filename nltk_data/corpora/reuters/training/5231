ISRAELI INFLATION RATE IS 1.0 PCT IN FEBRUARY
  Israel's inflation rate for February
  was one pct, compared to 2.1 pct in January and 1.6 pct in
  February 1986, a spokesman for the Central Bureau of Statistics
  said.
      Inflation for the 12 months ending in February was 23 pct,
  the spokesman said.
      February price rises were mostly in housing, health,
  education, entertainment and transport.
      Wage and price controls have been in force since August
  1985. Officials said the controls have helped soften the effect
  of a recent 10 pct devaluation of the shekel.
