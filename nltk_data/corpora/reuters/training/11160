JAPAN UNEMPLOYMENT FALLS IN FEBRUARY
  Japan's seasonally adjusted unemployment
  rate fell to 2.9 pct in February from the record 3.0 pct in
  January, the government's Management and Coordination Agency
  said.
      The January level was the worst since the Goverment started
  compiling unemployment statistics under the current system in
  1953.
      Unemployment was up from 2.8 pct a year earlier.
      Unadjusted February unemployment totalled 1.86 mln people,
  up from 1.82 mln in January and 1.64 mln a year earlier.
      Male unemployment in February remained at 2.9 pct, equal to
  the second-highest level set in January and December. Record
  male unemployment of 3.1 pct was set in July 1986.
      Female unemployment rose to a record 3.1 pct in February
  from the previous record 3.0 pct marked in January 1987 and in
  April, August, September and December last year.
      "Japan's employment condition was still severe in February
  as the non-rounded rate of unemployment in February fell only
  0.03 percentage points to 2.93 pct from 2.96 pct in January," an
  agency official said.
      Employment in manufacturing industries fell 430,000 from a
  year earlier to 14.22 mln people in February due to the yen's
  continued appreciation, while employment in non-manufacturing
  industries rose 380,000 to 12.11 mln.
      In manufacturing industries, employment in the textile
  industry fell 180,000 to 1.94 mln in February, while in
  ordinary and precision machinery industries it fell 160,000 to
  1.50 mln.
