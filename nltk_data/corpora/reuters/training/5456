MRS FIELDS PLANS TO OPEN MORE STORES
  U.S. Based speciality food retailer &lt;Mrs
  Fields Inc>, which earlier announced pre-tax profits of 17.1
  mln dlrs in 1986 against 6.8 mln in 1985, said it plans further
  growth this year with the opening of 125 new stores in the U.S.
      The company, which is quoted on London's Unlisted
  Securities Market (USM), said it also planned to expand its
  outlets internationally.
      However, chairman Randall Fields told a news conference the
  company would not move into any new countries during 1987 but
  would intensify its efforts where it already had stores.
      During 1986 the company opened 81 new stores, including 76
  in the U.S., Two in Australia and one each in Japan, Canada and
  the U.K.
      "We intend to open a minimum of five more units in London
  for example and it is reasonable that we might open other
  stores in other European countries in 1988," Fields said.
      He said the company acquired competitive businesses as a
  matter of routine, and might add others in 1987, but declined
  to say how much the company planned to spend on them.
      Last year turnover rose by 20.8 pct to 87.1 mln dlrs from
  72.6 mln dlrs in 1985.
