BENETTON OF ITALY SEES EXPANSION, ACQUISITIONS
  &lt;Benetton SpA> of Italy expects to
  further diversify into financial services and is weighing 
  possible acquisitions, a Benetton spokeswoman here said.
      "We are thinking of diversification outside of the retail
  line," the spokeswoman said. "We are looking at financial
  services and other manfacturing companies."
      However, she said the company was not targeting the U.S.
  for its planned expansion, but was looking at a number of
  different countries.
      The company's shares are traded in the U.S. as American
  Depository Receipts, which were issued through an offering by
  Morgan Stanley Group Inc &lt;MS> earlier this month.
      Benetton is now holding talks with Wall Street firms about
  the possibility of receiving a quotation of its shares on the
  New York Stock Exchange. "There's absolutely no timetable. It
  may not even happen," the spokeswoman said.
      She also denied reports that the company was considering an
  issue of convertible bonds with warrants in the U.S. "We're not
  thinking of issuing bonds," she said.
      In line with its planned Global expansion efforts, Benetton
  is also holding talks with the Soviet Union to explore the
  possibility of opening up to 150 stores in the country. But the
  spokeswoman pointed out that many companies are holding talks
  with the Soviets.
      "We are in discussions and are looking forward to some
  response," she said. She added the company had no firm
  timetable on when a response might be received.
