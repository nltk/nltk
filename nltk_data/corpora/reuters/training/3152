UAW SAYS IT BACK CHRYSLER &lt;C>, AMC &lt;AMO> MERGER
  The United Auto Workers &lt;UAW> union said
  it supports Chrysler Corp's proposal to buy American Motors
  Corp as creating "a good match that potentially points the way
  to a more secure future for workers at both companies."
      "We believe our members' interests can be well served
  within the Chrysler family, and we are committed to making that
  happen," UAW president Owen Bieber and vice president Marc
  Stepp said in a statement.
      "We believe Chrysler's purchase is a logical and sound step
  for all concerned," the union said.
      The UAW is negotiating with AMC over the carmaker's demand
  for economic concessions covering workers at its Wisconsin
  operations, without which AMC has said it would cease vehicle
  production at its Kenosha, Wisconsin, assembly plant by 1989.
