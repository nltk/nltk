REAGAN UPBEAT ABOUT LATEST GNP FIGURES
  President Reagan said the 1.1 pct
  U.S. economic growth rate during the final quarter of 1986
  "wasn't all that bad."
      The Commerce Department said the rate of growth of the
  Gross National Product in the October-December period was only
  slightly less than a preliminary estimate of 1.3 pct made
  earlier.
      At the same time, it said inflation, as measured by the GNP
  price deflator, rose by 0.7 pct during the period.
      Asked his reaction to the GNP report during a White House
  photo session, Reagan replied, "It wasn't all that bad."
