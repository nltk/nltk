KODAK &lt;EK> BUYS STAKE IN ENZON &lt;ENZN>
  Eastman Kodak Co said it has
  acquired an 18.7 pct equity interest in Enzon Inc, a
  pharmaceutical company specializing in protein therapy.
      Kodak said it secured worldwide marketing rights for three
  of Enzon's PEG enzymes used in the treatment of oxygen toxicity
  disorders, hyperuricemia and gout.
      The company said it acquired two mln Enzon shares for 15
  mln dlrs, with loans to Enzon of two mln dlrs and interest of
  30,000 dlrs credited against the purchase price.
      Kodak said the drugs covered by the marketing rights are in
  initial stages of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
  approval process.  It said the investment should provide the
  necessary capital to complete the FDA review process and
  provide a marketing outlet for the drugs.
      The drugs are PEG-superoxide disdmutase and PEG-catalase,
  for use against oxygen toxicity disorders that cause the
  often-fatal tissue damage associated with severe burns, organ
  transplants, heart attacks and trauma, and PEG-uricase, for
  treatment of gout and other conditions caused by the buildup of
  high levels of uric acid in the body.
