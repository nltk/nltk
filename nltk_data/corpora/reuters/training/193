USDA SAID UNLIKELY TO BROADEN CORN BONUS OFFER
  The U.S. Agriculture Department
  probably will not offer a two dlr per bushel bonus payment to
  corn farmers for any erodible cropland they enrolled in the
  conservation reserve program last year, an aide to USDA
  Secretary Richard Lyng said.
      Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) said yesterday that Lyng had
  indicated he would consider giving those farmers the same two
  dlr bonus offered corn farmers who are signing up for the 1987
  program this month.
      But the aide to Lyng said it was doubtful that the
  department would offer a retroactive bonus to farmers who
  enrolled land in the 10-year conservation reserve last year.
      "How are you going to stop the tide," he said, referring to
  demands that would follow from other commodity groups.
