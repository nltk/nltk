CSCE ALTERS RULES ON TRADING LIMITS
  The Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange
  amended regulations governing expanded trading limits on
  coffee, cocoa and sugar contracts to provide uniformity.
      Effective today, the exchange will permit normal daily
  price limits in those commodities to expand whenever the first
  two limited contract months move the limit in the same
  direction for two consecutive sessions.
      The normal daily limits will be reinstated once the first
  two limited deliveries close by less than the normal limit for
  two successive trading days.
      Previously exchange rules required the first three limited
  months to move the limit in coffee and cocoa. It had required
  the first two limited sugar deliveries to make such moves for
  three consecutive sessions.
