COFFEE QUOTA TALKS CONTINUE BUT NO AGREEMENT YET
  Coffee quota talks at the International
  Coffee Organization council meeting here continued this
  afternoon, but producers and consumers still had not reached
  common ground on the key issue of how to estimate export
  quotas, delegates said.
      The 54 member contact group was examining a Colombian
  proposal to resume quotas April 1 under the ad hoc system used
  historically, with a pledge to meet again in September to
  discuss how quotas would be worked out in the future, they
  said.
      Delegates would not speculate on the prospects for
  agreement at this time.
      "Anything could happen," one delegate said.
