for timing reasons having to do with baby sitters , we recently went to a multiplex and saw undercover blues . 
i would give it one half of a star for guts . 
anyone in a movie this bad would have to have guts . 
i later read a ny times review that said kathleen turner and dennis quaid had gotten so plump they looked like they had the mumps in the show . 
the script was the worst part . 
they had characters who talked with funny accents in an attempt to make you laugh . 
they had lots of " great " sight gags like two people trying to go in a door together and therefore bumping shoulders against the door . 
turner and quaid both kept smiling like some idiots on a game show . 
the good news is that we were smart enough to vote with our feet and left . 
buy some tickets and give them to your worst enemies . 
tell them the show is great and smile a lot . 
 * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . 
a must see film . 
 * * * = excellent show . 
look for it . 
 * * = average movie . 
kind of enjoyable . 
 * = poor show . 
don't waste your money . 
0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . 
totally unbearable .
