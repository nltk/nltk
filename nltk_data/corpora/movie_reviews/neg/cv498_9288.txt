i think we should , as responsible citizens , all get together and stop jim carrey from making another movie . 
he's changing the cinema as we know it--and for the worst . 
i would willingly rewatch batman and robin rather then again sit through this miserable collection of filmic moments--prologues , epilogues , etc . the premise : a lawyer can't lie for a day . 
ho , ho . 
normally a movie made from this premise would be terrible--mr . 
carrey suceeds in making it unwatchable . 
i laughed once--and i was laughing at the sight of everyone else laughing . 
grinding doesn't begin to describe . 
it pounds on your head so forcefully and so unstoppably that , if you are a normal person , you leave feeling sick . 
when it's not trying to be funny , it's trying to be melodramatic--but it's just annoying , stupid and sappy . 
at best . 
this movie is intended to make people laugh , yes , not to be voted best picture of all time by sight and sound . 
but , it fails on every possible level . 
it fails to be funny . 
it fails to be insightful . 
it fails to be suspensful . 
it fails to be fun . 
they should pay people to see it . 
it suceeds on one level--it makes me want to get down on the ground and start thanking orson welles , for having lived . 
if you go in with the intention of coming out alive , please make sure that you are overly fond of boob , fart , pimple and fat jokes--otherwise you will go insane . 
yes , literally insane . 
stark , raving mad . 
it is boring , stupid , melodramatic and in the end ugly . 
i reccemond it strongly . 
to ed wood .
