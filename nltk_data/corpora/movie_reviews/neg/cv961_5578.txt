barb wire , pamela anderson lee's first foray into films , highlights the fact that her only talent lies in her silicone enhanced assets . 
being the only notable member of the cast , the camera lingers lustily o n her body at every opportunity , making her character's catch line , " don't call me babe , " sound very ironic indeed . 
from the very opening of the movie , we are treated to a striptease routine from anderson , ending in her hurling her stiletto smack between the eyes of a lusty male who happened to call her babe . 
throughout the movie , there is ample footage of enormous breasts and cleavage , if not of anderson's , then at least of the female extras . 
this alone is enough to retitle the movie babe wire . 
for a plot , barb wire rehashes the casablanca storyline . 
it is 2017 , the middle of the second american civil war , and barb wire , a former resistance fighter , runs a joint in steel harbour called hammerhead ( ! ! ) . 
known for attracting resistance fighters an d characters of all sorts , the bar attracts the attention of the government forces who appear dressed in nazi-style uniforms . 
in between bashing up helpless males and showing off her trademark breasts , barb wire has to help a former lover and his wife get to the airport on the other side of the town , past the government-controlled areas , and to freedom . 
even the airport looks like the one in casablanca , except that the plane in the background is a modern , private jet . 
there are hardly any significant moments in this film , and one gets the impression that it was designed for young teenagers familiar with the dark horse comics version of " barb wire . " 
if anything , one leaves the film with the confirmation that anderson di d not do her own stunts . 
who could fight and jump in a skimpy , strapless leather top , and yet keep her breasts from spilling out ? 
only a stuntwoman . 
not pamela anderson lee .
