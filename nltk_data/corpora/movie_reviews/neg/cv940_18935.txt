yet another brainless teen flick , this one is about , surprise , drugs and sex . 
stars katie holmes and sarah polly couldn't look more bored . 
their characters are cardboard cut-outs of every cliched teenager out there . 
one thing you need to know is i really hated this movie . 
everything about it annoyed the hell out of me . 
the acting , and script , the plot , and ending . 
the director ( of the fluke hit swingers ) could have very well directed a bunch of no-name actors and had a watchabe film . 
the " big " stars of go pretty much drown the project of any originality . 
i felt like i was watching dawson's creek episode 200 . 
although the film still would have stayed at red despite its cast . 
the " surprise " ending was sooo predictable . 
since when is a male character's sudden outing of the closet considered a surprise in hollywood anymore ? ? 
go is dawson's creek + varsity blues - she's all that = go home and watch something else .
