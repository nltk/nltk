bob the happy bastard's quickie review : 
the odd couple ii 
grumpy old men , it ain't . 
hell , my fellow americans , it ain't . 
walter matthau and jack lemmon team up again for an even more worn out vehicle than any of their films over the past few years . 
odd couple ii feels terribly generic , where in the first movie , made thirty one years ago , feels like a wonderful tale . 
that's like repackaging campbell's soup in a generic food can , really . 
how writer neil simon could've made such a horrible mistake in screen writing is beyond me . 
throughout the movie , i really didn't laugh once . 
honestly . 
i mean , there were dumb situations , yeah , like the cropduster who let these old geezers have it without any notice , but they just really didn't seem funny to me . 
and that car rolling off the cliff ? 
the only way i would've seen humor in that is if they were still in it . 
and the ending gets all super-mushy , too . 
in the final twenty minutes or so , lemmon meets a girl he thinks is the one , then loses her ; matthau talks to his son ( a wasted jonathan silverman ) about his amrriage to lemmon's daughter ; and , of course , lemmon and matthau have another roomie situation on their hands . 
ooh , i really gave a lot away there , i'm sure . 
consider it a hospitable gester , you won't waste your time renting this muck .
