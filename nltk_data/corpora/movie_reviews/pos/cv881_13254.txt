the word 'rest' in the title should be stressed since this is a movie that lacks any action scenes at all . 
what does takes place is more based on character development . 
the film starts right in the middle of the lives of four people : nick , beth , carol and sid . 
what they have done earlier is for the most part only hinted at . 
nick and beth have a relationship and have decided to move from enfield , arizona to butte , montana . 
 ( and i who thought that butte was pronounced slightly different . . . ) 
carol is nick's ex-girlfriend and beth's best friend , sid is a joint-smoking painter that comes to repaint their house before the new tenants move in . 
obviously based on a stage play , the problem with the movie is that there's a lot of things left out . 
it's not obvious that nick and beth are in love with each other , the reason why nick was fired from his job isn't mentioned . 
and why nick suddenly decide to go visit his parents remain a mystery , when he hasn't seen them for many years . 
set in a small ( fictional ? ) 
town in arizona was a good move , since this makes the film focus on the four characters and not on their surroundings . 
the name of the city is not important , this could take place anywhere with four young people in a house discussing life and the future . 
particularly impressive is bridget fonda as beth who end up in bed with sid when her fiance nick leaves her . 
not an actress that i have found interesting earlier or seen many pictures with , but i'll keep an eye on her in the future . 
interesting trivia : this was rated r in the us but rated 'barntill ? ten' in sweden wich means that anyone at any age can see it .
