                       TIMIT Lexicon Documentation


The dictionary found in the file "timitdic.txt" contains entries for all of
the words in the TIMIT prompts.  There are a total of 6229 entries in the
lexicon.  The lexicon was derived in part from the MIT adapted version of the
Merriam-Webster Pocket Dictionary of 1964 ("Pocket") and a preliminary version
of a general English lexicon under development at CMU.  The pronunciations in
the MIT pocket lexicon have been verified and modified over the years by
various people.  However, many of the words in the TIMIT scripts did not
appear in the pocket lexicon, and needed to be added.  These include other
forms of words found in "Pocket" and words not found in any form.  Rules were
used to generate pronunciations in the former case and the derived
pronunciations were hand-checked.  In the latter case, consisting mainly of
proper names and abbreviated forms (such as "takin'" instead of "taking" or
"'em"), the pronunciations were added by hand.

The symbols in the lexical representation are abstract, quasi-phonemic marks
representing the underlying sounds and typically correspond to a variety of
different sounds in the actual recordings.  The term quasi-phonemic is used
because some differences represented in the lexicon are often found in speech,
even though they are not really phonemically distinctive in English, such as
the /er/~/axr/ in which /er/ co-occurs with stress.



Format of the Lexicon
---------------------

All entries have been converted to lower case.  Stress markers are given as 1
for primary stress and 2 for secondary stress, tacked on to the end of the
vowel symbol.  Hyphenated words such as "head-in-the-clouds" can be found as a
single entry and as the individual words "head", "in", "the", and "clouds".
One pronunciation is provided per entry except in the case where the same
orthography corresponds to different parts of speech with different
pronunciations, and both forms exist in the TIMIT scripts.  To differentiate
these words, multiple entries are given, with the syntactic class following
the symbol ~.  The classes found in the lexicon are:  ~n noun ~v verb ~adj
adjective ~pres present tense ~past past tense.

An example is the word "live", with the entries:
   live~v  l ih v
   live~adj l ay v 



Pronunciation Conventions
-------------------------

The pronunciation is specified using the the CMU symbol set (see "phoncode.doc"
for a description of the symbols).  While it is realized that one
pronunciation is often not sufficient, many of the alternate pronunciations
may be predicted by use of phonological rules and may be highly dialect
dependent.  Using only one pronunciation per word forced the somewhat vexing
decision of which one to use.  We did not put extensive study into such
issues, and do not make any claims of the theoretical correctness of our
decisions on particular words.  Our tendency has been to use the more marked
alternate because we think it is harder to predict.  We tried to make the
pronunciations as consistent as possible.  In a number of cases we referred to
the authorities Kenyon and Knott (1953) and Webster's Third New International
Dictionary (1966).


1) Vowel variability:

Many of the pronunciation differences for vowels occur in semi-vowel
environments and in unstressed syllables.

- The vowel in words like "for", "pour", and "more" are often transcribed
using either the vowel /ow/ or the vowel /ao/.  This lexicon uses /ao/.

- The vowel in words like "air" and "care" has been transcribed using /ae/, so
as to differentiate this vowel from the /eh/ in "berry".  Some speakers
actually make a three-way distinction ("Mary" "merry" "marry"), with the vowel
in Mary being somewhat in between an /eh/, /ae/, and /ey/.  These speakers may
use the same vowel in words like "care".

 - The vowel /ih/ (as opposed to /iy/) has been systematically used in the
transcription of words like "fear" and "year". 

- unstressed schwa alternation /ix/~/ax/:  /ix/ is usually used for schwas
between 2 alveolars ("roses" /r ow1 z ix z/), otherwise /ax/ is used ("ahead"
/ax hh eh1 d/).  

- /r/ following the diphthongs /aw/ ("hour") and /ay/ ("fire") have been
transcribed as /axr/, except where the /r/ is syllable-initial as in words
like "irate" and "virus".

- vowel reduction:  In some cases the pronunciation of a word may alternate
between a full vowel and a highly reduced one.  In these cases preference was
given to the pronunciation with the more marked vowel instead of the schwa.
For example, the pronunciation of "accept" is given as /ae1 k s eh p t/, not
/ax1 k s eh p t/.



2) Stress differences:

- /er/~/axr/ alternation -- /axr/ is used in unstressed syllables and /er/ in
stressed syllables.

- /ih/~/ix/, /ah/~/ax/ -- once again the distinction is based on stress.  The
forms /ix/ and /ax/ are used in reduced syllables.  

- /y uw/~/y uh/ -- the tendency is to use /y uw/ in stressed positions as in
"attribution" /ae t r ih b y uw1 sh ix n/, and /y uh/ in unstressed position
as in "attribute~v" /ax t r ih2 b y uh t/.



3) Syllabics: 

The transcriptions are fairly liberal in the use of the syllabics /em/, /en/,
and /el/, even though they may be pronounced as a sequence of a schwa followed
by /m/, /n/, or /l/.  For example, words ending in "-ism" are transcribed as
/ih z em/ even though a short schwa often appears in the transition from the
/z/ to the /em/.

- /en/ must follow a coronal, except in rare occurrences such as "cap'n" 
/k ae1 p en/ and "haven't" /h ae1 v en t/.

- in general, /el/ is used instead of /ax l/ except before a stressed vowel.
Some exceptions are found in words ending in the "-ly" suffix.  For example,
"angrily" is transcribed /ae1 ng g r ax l iy/, not /ae1 ng g r el iy/.  The
only occurrences of /el l/ are found in compound words such as "jungle-like"
and "liberal-led".
