Introduction/nn-hl 
Because/rb of/in the/at simplicity/nn of/in the/at molecules/nns ,/, isotopic/jj exchange/nn reactions/nns between/in elemental/jj halogens/nns and/cc the/at corresponding/jj carbon/nn tetrahalides/nns would/md appear/vb to/to offer/vb particularly/ql fruitful/jj possibilities/nns for/in obtaining/vbg unambiguous/jj basic/jj kinetic/jj data/nn ./.
It/pps would/md appear/vb that/cs it/pps should/md be/be possible/jj to/to determine/vb unique/jj mechanisms/nns for/in the/at thermal/jj and/cc photochemical/jj reactions/nns in/in both/abx the/at liquid/jj and/cc gas/nn phases/nns and/cc to/to determine/vb values/nns for/in activation/nn energies/nns of/in some/dti of/in the/at intermediate/jj reactions/nns of/in atoms/nns and/cc free/jj radicals/nns ,/, as/ql well/rb as/cs information/nn on/in the/at heat/nn of/in dissociation/nn of/in the/at carbon-halogen/nn bond/nn ./.
The/at reaction/nn of/in chlorine/nn with/in carbon/nn tetrachloride/nn seemed/vbd particularly/ql suited/vbn for/in such/jj studies/nns ./.
It/pps should/md be/be possible/jj to/to prepare/vb very/ql pure/jj chlorine/nn by/in oxidation/nn of/in inorganic/jj chlorides/nns on/in a/at vacuum/nn system/nn followed/vbn by/in multiple/jj distillation/nn of/in the/at liquid/nn ./.
It/pps should/md be/be possible/jj to/to free/vb carbon/nn tetrachloride/nn of/in any/dti interfering/vbg substances/nns by/in the/at usual/jj purification/nn methods/nns followed/vbn by/in prechlorination/nn prior/rb to/in addition/nn of/in radioactive/jj chlorine/nn ./.
Furthermore/rb ,/, the/at exchange/nn would/md not/* be/be expected/vbn to/to be/be sensitive/jj to/in trace/jj amounts/vbz of/in impurities/nns because/cs it/pps would/md not/* be/be apt/jj to/to be/be a/at chain/nn reaction/nn since/cs the/at activation/nn energy/nn for/in abstraction/nn of/in chlorine/nn by/in a/at chlorine/nn atom/nn would/md be/be expected/vbn to/to be/be too/ql high/jj ;/. ;/.
also/rb it/pps would/md be/be expected/vbn that/dt Af/nn would/md compete/vb very/ql effectively/rb with/in any/dti impurities/nns as/cs a/at scavenger/nn for/in Af/nn radicals/nns ./.
Contrary/jj to/in these/dts expectations/nns we/ppss have/hv found/vbn it/ppo impossible/jj to/to obtain/vb the/at degree/nn of/in reproducibility/nn one/pn would/md wish/vb ,/, even/rb with/in extensive/jj efforts/nns to/to prepare/vb especially/ql pure/jj reagents/nns ./.
We/ppss are/ber reporting/vbg these/dts investigations/nns here/rb briefly/rb because/rb of/in their/pp$ relevancy/nn to/in problems/nns of/in the/at study/nn of/in apparently/rb simple/jj exchange/nn reactions/nns of/in chlorine/nn and/cc because/cs the/at results/nns furnish/vb some/dti information/nn on/in the/at activation/nn energy/nn for/in abstraction/nn of/in chlorine/nn atoms/nns from/in carbon/nn tetrachloride/nn ./.

--/-- Matheson/np highest/jjt purity/nn tank/nn chlorine/nn was/bedz passed/vbn through/in a/at tube/nn of/in resublimed/vbn Af/nn into/in an/at evacuated/vbn Pyrex/np system/nn where/wrb it/pps was/bedz condensed/vbn with/in liquid/jj air/nn ./.
It/pps was/bedz then/rb distilled/vbn at/in least/ap three/cd times/nns from/in a/at trap/nn at/in -78-degrees/nns to/in a/at liquid/jj air/nn trap/nn with/in only/rb a/at small/jj middle/nn fraction/nn being/beg retained/vbn in/in each/dt distillation/nn ./.
The/at purified/vbn product/nn was/bedz stored/vbn at/in -78-degrees/nns in/in a/at tube/nn equipped/vbn with/in a/at break/nn seal/nn ./.


	Of/in several/ap methods/nns employed/vbn for/in tagging/vbg chlorine/nn with/in radiochlorine/nn ,/, the/at exchange/nn of/in inactive/jj chlorine/nn with/in tagged/vbn aluminum/nn chloride/nn at/in room/nn temperature/nn was/bedz found/vbn to/to be/be the/at most/ql satisfactory/jj ./.
To/to prepare/vb the/at latter/ap ,/, silver/nn chloride/nn was/bedz precipitated/vbn from/in a/at solution/nn containing/vbg Af/nn obtained/vbn from/in the/at Oak/nn-tl Ridge/nn-tl National/jj-tl Laboratory/nn-tl ./.

The/at radiochlorine/nn was/bedz stored/vbn at/in -78-degrees/nns in/in a/at tube/nn equipped/vbn with/in a/at break/nn seal/nn ./.


	Liter/nn quantities/nns of/in Mallinckrodt/np ,/, low/jj sulfur/nn ,/, reagent/nn grade/nn carbon/nn tetrachloride/nn were/bed saturated/vbn with/in Af/nn and/cc Af/nn and/cc illuminated/vbn for/in about/rb 50/cd hours/nns with/in a/at 1000/cd watt/nn tungsten/nn lamp/nn at/in a/at distance/nn of/in a/at few/ap inches/nns ./.

This/dt chlorine-carbon/nn tetrachloride/nn solution/nn was/bedz illuminated/vbn for/in a/at day/nn following/vbg which/wdt the/at flask/nn was/bedz resealed/vbn onto/in a/at vacuum/nn system/nn and/cc the/at excess/nn chlorine/nn distilled/vbn off/rp ./.
The/at required/vbn amount/nn of/in carbon/nn tetrachloride/nn was/bedz distilled/vbn into/in a/at series/nn of/in reaction/nn cells/nns on/in a/at manifold/nn on/in a/at vacuum/nn line/nn ./.
The/at desired/vbn amounts/nns of/in inactive/jj chlorine/nn and/cc radioactive/jj chlorine/nn were/bed likewise/rb condensed/vbn in/in these/dts cells/nns on/in the/at vacuum/nn line/nn following/vbg which/wdt they/ppss were/bed frozen/vbn down/rp and/cc the/at manifold/nn as/cs a/at whole/nn was/bedz sealed/vbn off/rp ./.
The/at contents/nns of/in the/at manifold/nn for/in liquid/jj phase/nn experiments/nns were/bed then/rb mixed/vbn by/in shaking/vbg ,/, redistributed/vbn to/in the/at reaction/nn tubes/nns ,/, frozen/vbn down/rp ,/, and/cc each/dt tube/nn was/bedz then/rb sealed/vbn off/rp ./.
The/at reactants/nns for/in the/at gas/nn phase/nn experiments/nns were/bed first/rb frozen/vbn out/rp in/in a/at side-arm/nn attached/vbn to/in the/at manifold/nn and/cc then/rb allowed/vbn to/to distil/vb slowly/rb into/in the/at manifold/nn of/in pre-cooled/jj reaction/nn cells/nns before/cs sealing/vbg off/rp ./.

--/-- The/at samples/nns for/in liquid/jj phase/nn thermal/jj reaction/nn studies/nns were/bed prepared/vbn in/in Pyrex/np capillary/nn tubing/nn 2.5/cd mm./nns i.d./nn and/cc about/rb 15/cd cm./nns long/jj ./.
In/in a/at few/ap experiments/nns the/at tubes/nns were/bed made/vbn from/in standard/jj 6/cd mm./nn i.d./nn Pyrex/np tubing/nn of/in 1/cd mm./nn wall/nn thickness/nn ./.
Both/abx types/nns of/in tube/nn withstood/vbd the/at pressure/nn of/in approximately/rb 20/cd atmospheres/nns exerted/vbn by/in the/at carbon/nn tetrachloride/nn at/in 220-degrees/nns ./.

These/dts cells/nns were/bed used/vbn rather/rb than/in square/jj Pyrex/np tubing/nn because/rb of/in the/at tendency/nn of/in the/at latter/ap to/to shatter/vb when/wrb thawing/vbg frozen/vbn carbon/nn tetrachloride/nn ./.
The/at round/jj cells/nns were/bed reproducibly/rb positioned/vbn in/in the/at light/nn beam/nn which/wdt entered/vbd the/at thermostated/jj mineral/nn oil-bath/nn through/in a/at window/nn ./.

The/at light/nn was/bedz filtered/vbn by/in the/at soft/jj glass/nn window/nn of/in the/at thermostat/nn thus/rb ensuring/vbg that/cs only/ap light/nn absorbed/vbn by/in the/at chlorine/nn and/cc not/* by/in the/at carbon/nn tetrachloride/nn could/md enter/vb the/at reaction/nn cell/nn ./.

Carrier/nn Af/nn was/bedz added/vbn and/cc the/at aqueous/jj and/cc organic/jj phases/nns were/bed separated/vbn (/( cells/nns containing/vbg gaseous/jj reactants/nns were/bed immersed/vbn in/in liquid/jj air/nn before/cs opening/vbg under/in sodium/nn iodide/nn )/) ./.
After/in titration/nn of/in the/at liberated/vbn Af/nn with/in Af/nn ,/, aliquots/nns of/in the/at aqueous/jj and/cc of/in the/at organic/jj phase/nn were/bed counted/vbn in/in a/at solution-type/jj Geiger/np tube/nn ./.
In/in the/at liquid/jj phase/nn runs/nns the/at amount/nn of/in carbon/nn tetrachloride/nn in/in each/dt reaction/nn tube/nn was/bedz determined/vbn by/in weighing/vbg the/at tube/nn before/cs opening/vbg and/cc weighing/vbg the/at fragments/nns after/cs emptying/vbg ./.
The/at fraction/nn of/in exchange/nn was/bedz determined/vbn as/cs the/at ratio/nn of/in the/at counts/nns //in minute/nn observed/vbn in/in the/at carbon/nn tetrachloride/nn to/in the/at counts/nns //in minute/nn calculated/vbn for/in the/at carbon/nn tetrachloride/nn fractions/nns for/in equilibrium/nn distribution/nn of/in the/at activity/nn between/in the/at chlorine/nn and/cc carbon/nn tetrachloride/nn ,/, empirically/rb determined/vbn correction/nn being/beg made/vbn for/in the/at difference/nn in/in counting/vbg efficiency/nn of/in Af/nn in/in Af/nn and/cc Af/nn ./.
