Emotional/jj-hl characteristics/nns-hl 
How/wrb a/at child/nn feels/vbz about/in himself/ppl ,/, about/in other/ap people/nns ,/, and/cc about/in the/at tasks/nns confronting/vbg him/ppo in/in school/nn may/md have/hv as/ql much/ap influence/nn on/in his/pp$ success/nn in/in school/nn as/cs his/pp$ physical/jj and/cc intellectual/jj characteristics/nns ./.
A/at considerable/jj amount/nn of/in evidence/nn exists/vbz to/to show/vb that/cs an/at unhappy/jj and/cc insecure/jj child/nn is/bez not/* likely/jj to/to do/do well/rb in/in school/nn subjects/nns ./.
Emotional/jj maturity/nn is/bez the/at result/nn of/in many/ap factors/nns ,/, the/at principal/jjs ones/nns being/beg the/at experiences/nns of/in the/at first/od few/ap years/nns of/in the/at child's/nn$ life/nn ./.

The/at following/vbg generalizations/nns about/in the/at emotional/jj characteristics/nns of/in elementary-school/nn children/nns may/md be/be helpful/jj ./.
1/cd-hl ./.-hl

Typically/rb ,/, the/at young/jj child's/nn$ emotional/jj reactions/nns last/vb for/in a/at relatively/rb short/jj time/nn ,/, as/cs contrasted/vbn to/in those/dts of/in an/at adult/nn ./.
2/cd-hl ./.-hl

As/cs the/at child/nn grows/vbz older/jjr ,/, his/pp$ emotional/jj reactions/nns lead/vb to/in ``/`` moods/nns ''/'' ,/, or/cc emotional/jj states/nns drawn/vbn out/rp over/in a/at period/nn of/in time/nn and/cc expressed/vbn slowly/rb ,/, rather/rb than/cs in/in short/jj ,/, abrupt/jj outbursts/nns ./.
3/cd-hl ./.-hl

Studies/nns of/in the/at growth/nn and/cc decline/nn of/in children's/nns$ fears/nns indicate/vb that/cs fears/nns due/jj to/in strange/jj objects/nns ,/, noises/nns ,/, falling/vbg ,/, and/cc unexpected/jj movement/nn decline/vb during/in the/at preschool/jj years/nns ,/, but/cc that/cs fears/nns of/in the/at dark/nn ,/, of/in being/beg alone/rb ,/, and/cc of/in imaginary/jj creatures/nns or/cc robbers/nns increase/vb ./.
4/cd-hl ./.-hl

Ridiculing/vbg a/at child/nn for/in being/beg afraid/jj or/cc forcing/vbg him/ppo to/to meet/vb the/at feared/vbn situation/nn alone/rb are/ber poor/jj ways/nns of/in dealing/vbg with/in the/at problem/nn ;/. ;/.

5/cd-hl ./.-hl

Children/nns need/vb help/nn in/in learning/vbg to/to control/vb their/pp$ emotions/nns ./.
The/at young/jj child/nn learns/vbz from/in parents/nns and/cc teachers/nns that/cs temper/nn tantrums/nns ,/, screaming/vbg ,/, kicking/vbg ,/, and/cc hitting/vbg will/md not/* get/vb him/ppo what/wdt he/pps wants/vbz ;/. ;/.
the/at older/jjr child/nn learns/vbz that/cs intense/jj emotional/jj outbursts/nns will/md not/* win/vb approval/nn by/in his/pp$ peers/nns ,/, and/cc ,/, therefore/rb ,/, makes/vbz a/at real/jj effort/nn to/to control/vb his/pp$ emotions/nns ./.
6/cd-hl ./.-hl

Children/nns differ/vb widely/rb in/in their/pp$ emotional/jj responses/nns ./.
Among/in infants/nns the/at patterns/nns of/in emotional/jj responses/nns are/ber similar/jj ;/. ;/.
as/cs the/at influence/nn of/in learning/vbg and/cc environment/nn are/ber felt/vbn ,/, emotional/jj behavior/nn becomes/vbz individualized/vbn ./.
Social/jj-hl characteristics/nns-hl 
Although/cs no/at national/jj norms/nns exist/vb for/in the/at social/jj development/nn of/in children/nns ,/, the/at teacher/nn can/md find/vb a/at great/jj deal/nn of/in information/nn concerning/in types/nns of/in social/jj behavior/nn normally/rb displayed/vbn by/in children/nns at/in various/ap age/nn levels/nns ./.

The/at elementary-school/nn child/nn grows/vbz gradually/rb in/in his/pp$ ability/nn to/to work/vb in/in groups/nns ./.

Why/wrb-hl the/at-hl teacher/nn-hl should/md-hl study/vb-hl the/at-hl individual/jj-hl pupil/nn-hl 
Much/ap progress/nn has/hvz been/ben made/vbn in/in the/at last/ap two/cd decades/nns in/in developing/vbg techniques/nns for/in understanding/vbg children/nns ,/, yet/cc in/in almost/rb any/dti classroom/nn today/nr can/md be/be found/vbn children/nns whose/wp$ needs/nns are/ber not/* being/beg met/vbn by/in the/at school/nn program/nn ./.
Some/dti are/ber failing/vbg to/to achieve/vb as/ql much/ap as/cs their/pp$ ability/nn would/md permit/vb ;/. ;/.
others/nns never/rb seem/vb able/jj to/to enter/vb fully/rb into/in the/at life/nn of/in the/at classroom/nn ./.
These/dts children/nns have/hv been/ben described/vbn as/cs those/dts who/wps were/bed trying/vbg to/to say/vb something/pn to/in adults/nns who/wps did/dod not/* understand/vb ./.


	Many/ap school/nn systems/nns now/rb employ/vb school/nn psychologists/nns and/cc child/nn guidance/nn specialists/nns ./.
These/dts specialists/nns perform/vb valuable/jj services/nns by/in helping/vbg teachers/nns learn/vb to/to identify/vb children/nns who/wps need/vb special/jj attention/nn ,/, by/in suggesting/vbg ways/nns of/in meeting/vbg the/at needs/nns of/in individual/jj children/nns in/in the/at regular/jj classroom/nn ,/, and/cc by/in providing/vbg clinical/jj services/nns for/in severely/ql maladjusted/jj children/nns ./.
It/pps is/bez the/at classroom/nn teacher/nn ,/, however/rb ,/, who/wps has/hvz daily/jj contacts/nns with/in pupils/nns ,/, and/cc who/wps is/bez in/in a/at unique/jj position/nn to/to put/vb sound/jj psychological/jj principles/nns into/in practice/nn ./.
Indeed/rb ,/, a/at study/nn of/in the/at individual/jj child/nn is/bez an/at integral/jj part/nn of/in the/at work/nn of/in the/at elementary-school/nn teacher/nn ,/, rather/rb than/cs merely/rb an/at additional/jj chore/nn ./.


	Teachers/nns and/cc administrators/nns in/in many/ap elementary/jj schools/nns have/hv assumed/vbn that/cs dividing/vbg the/at pupils/nns in/in any/dti grade/nn into/in groups/nns on/in the/at basis/nn of/in test/nn scores/nns solves/vbz the/at problem/nn of/in meeting/vbg the/at needs/nns of/in individuals/nns ./.
What/wdt they/ppss should/md recognize/vb is/bez that/cs children/nns who/wps have/hv been/ben placed/vbn in/in one/cd of/in these/dts groups/nns on/in a/at narrow/jj academic/jj basis/nn still/rb differ/vb widely/rb in/in attributes/nns that/wps influence/vb success/nn ,/, and/cc that/cs they/ppss still/rb must/md be/be treated/vbn as/cs individuals/nns ./.

Factors/nns-hl that/wps-hl inhibit/vb-hl learning/vbg-hl and/cc-hl lead/vb-hl to/in-hl maladjustment/nn-hl 
Studies/nns conducted/vbn in/in various/ap sections/nns of/in the/at United/vbn-tl States/nns-tl indicate/vb that/cs many/ap children/nns in/in elementary/jj schools/nns are/ber maladjusted/jj emotionally/rb ,/, and/cc that/cs many/ap of/in them/ppo are/ber failing/vbg to/to make/vb satisfactory/jj progress/nn in/in school/nn subjects/nns ./.
One/cd study/nn ,/, which/wdt involved/vbd 1,524/cd pupils/nns in/in grades/nns one/cd to/in six/cd ,/, found/vbd that/cs 12/cd percent/nn of/in the/at pupils/nns were/bed seriously/ql maladjusted/jj and/cc that/cs 23/cd percent/nn were/bed reading/vbg a/at year/nn below/in capacity/nn ./.

When/wrb a/at child/nn fails/vbz to/to meet/vb the/at standards/nns of/in the/at school/nn in/in his/pp$ rate/nn of/in learning/vbg ,/, insecurity/nn ,/, unhappiness/nn ,/, and/cc other/ap forms/nns of/in maladjustment/nn frequently/rb follow/vb ./.

	It/pps is/bez easy/jj for/cs the/at teacher/nn to/to rationalize/vb that/cs the/at child/nn who/wps is/bez not/* achieving/vbg in/in accordance/nn with/in his/pp$ known/vbn ability/nn is/bez just/rb plain/ql lazy/jj ,/, or/cc that/cs the/at child/nn who/wps lacks/vbz interest/nn in/in school/nn ,/, who/wps dislikes/vbz the/at teacher/nn ,/, or/cc who/wps is/bez overaggressive/jj is/bez a/at hopeless/jj delinquent/nn ./.

A/at vision/nn handicap/nn that/wps may/md produce/vb nervous/jj tension/nn and/cc reading/vbg disability/nn for/in one/cd child/nn may/md spur/vb another/dt child/nn on/rp to/in even/ql greater/jjr achievement/nn in/in reading/vbg ./.
