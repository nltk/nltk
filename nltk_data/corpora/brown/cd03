	Now/rb again/rb in/in 1961/cd ,/, in/in England/np ,/, there/ex is/bez perhaps/rb nothing/pn in/in the/at religious/jj sphere/nn so/ql popularly/rb discussed/vbn as/cs Christian/jj unity/nn ./.
The/at Church/nn-tl Unity/nn-tl Octave/nn-tl ,/, January/np 18-25/cd ,/, was/bedz enthusiastically/rb devoted/vbn to/in prayer/nn and/cc discussion/nn by/in the/at various/jj churches/nns ./.

But/cc it/pps must/md be/be readily/rb seen/vbn that/cs the/at religious/jj picture/nn in/in England/np has/hvz so/ql greatly/rb changed/vbn during/in these/dts hundred/cd years/nns as/in to/in engender/vb hope/nn ,/, at/in least/ap on/in the/at Catholic/jj side/nn ./.
For/cs the/at ``/`` tide/nn is/bez well/rb on/in the/at turn/nn ''/'' ,/, as/cs the/at London/np Catholic/jj weekly/nn Universe/nn-tl has/hvz written/vbn ./.


	I/ppss came/vbd to/in England/np last/ap summer/nn to/to do/do research/nn on/in the/at unpublished/jj letters/nns of/in Cardinal/nn-tl Newman/np ./.
As/cs an/at American/jj Catholic/jj of/in Irish/jj ancestry/nn ,/, I/ppss came/vbd with/in certain/jj preconceptions/nns and/cc expectations/nns ;/. ;/.

Since/cs arriving/vbg here/rb ,/, however/rb ,/, I/ppss have/hv formed/vbn a/at far/ql different/jj religious/jj picture/nn of/in present-day/jj England/np ./.
In/in representing/vbg part/nn of/in this/dt new/jj picture/nn ,/, I/ppss will/md be/be recounting/vbg some/dti of/in my/pp$ own/jj personal/jj experiences/nns ,/, reactions/nns and/cc judgments/nns ;/. ;/.

	Since/cs the/at Protestant/jj clergy/nn for/in the/at most/ap part/nn wear/vb gray/jj or/cc some/dti variant/nn from/in the/at wholly/ql black/jj suit/nn ,/, my/pp$ Roman/jj collar/nn and/cc black/jj garb/nn usually/rb identify/vb me/ppo in/in England/np as/cs a/at Roman/jj Catholic/jj cleric/nn ./.
In/in any/dti case/nn ,/, I/ppss have/hv always/rb been/ben treated/vbn with/in the/at utmost/jjs courtesy/nn by/in Englishmen/nps ,/, even/rb in/in Devonshire/np and/cc Cornwall/np ,/, where/wrb anti-Catholic/jj feeling/nn has/hvz supposedly/rb existed/vbn the/at strongest/jjt and/cc longest/jjt ./.


	Nowhere/rb have/hv I/ppss seen/vbn public/jj expression/nn of/in anti-Catholicism/nn ./.
On/in my/pp$ first/od Guy/np-tl Fawkes/np-tl Day/nn-tl here/rb ,/, I/ppss found/vbd Catholics/nps as/ql well/rb as/cs non-Catholics/nps celebrating/vbg with/in the/at traditional/jj fireworks/nns and/cc bonfires/nns ,/, and/cc was/bedz told/vbn that/cs most/ap Englishmen/nps either/cc do/do not/* know/vb or/cc are/ber not/* concerned/vbn with/in the/at historical/jj significance/nn of/in the/at day/nn ./.
A/at Birmingham/np newspaper/nn printed/vbd in/in a/at column/nn for/in children/nns an/at article/nn entitled/vbn ``/`` The/at-tl True/jj-tl Story/nn-tl of/in-tl Guy/np-tl Fawkes/np-tl ''/'' ,/, which/wdt began/vbd :/:

In/in the/at 355/cd years/nns since/in the/at first/od Guy/np-tl Fawkes/np-tl Night/nn-tl ,/, much/ap of/in the/at story/nn has/hvz been/ben forgotten/vbn ,/, so/rb here/rb is/bez a/at reminder/nn ''/'' ./.
The/at article/nn proceeded/vbd to/to give/vb an/at inaccurate/jj account/nn of/in a/at Catholic/jj plot/nn to/to kill/vb King/nn-tl James/np 1/cd-tl ./.




In/in spite/nn of/in the/at increase/nn in/in numbers/nns and/cc prestige/nn brought/vbn about/rb by/in the/at conversions/nns of/in Newman/np and/cc other/ap Tractarians/nps of/in the/at 1840's/nns and/cc 1850's/nns ,/, the/at Catholic/jj segment/nn of/in England/np one/cd hundred/cd years/nns ago/rb was/bedz a/at very/ql small/jj one/cd (/( four/cd per/in cent/nn ,/, or/cc 800,000/cd )/) which/wdt did/dod not/* enjoy/vb a/at gracious/jj hearing/nn from/in the/at general/jj public/nn ./.
The/at return/nn of/in the/at Catholic/jj hierarchy/nn in/in 1850/cd was/bedz looked/vbn upon/rb with/in indignant/jj disapprobation/nn and/cc ,/, in/in fact/nn ,/, was/bedz charged/vbn with/in being/beg a/at gesture/nn of/in disloyalty/nn ./.
In/in 1864/cd Newman/np professedly/rb had/hvd to/to write/vb his/pp$ Apologia/np with/in his/pp$ keenest/jjt feelings/nns in/in order/nn to/to be/be believed/vbn and/cc to/to command/vb a/at fair/jj hearing/nn from/in English/jj readers/nns ./.


	Now/rb ,/, in/in 1961/cd ,/, the/at Catholic/jj population/nn of/in England/np is/bez still/rb quite/ql small/jj (/( ten/cd per/in cent/nn ,/, or/cc 5/cd million/cd )/) ;/. ;/.
yet/cc it/pps represents/vbz a/at very/ql considerable/jj percentage/nn of/in the/at churchgoing/jj population/nn ./.
A/at Protestant/jj woman/nn marveled/vbd to/in me/ppo over/in the/at large/jj crowds/nns going/vbg in/in and/cc out/in of/in the/at Birmingham/np-tl Oratory/nn-tl (/( Catholic/jj )/) Church/nn-tl on/in Sunday/nr mornings/nns ./.
She/pps found/vbd this/dt a/at marvel/nn because/cs ,/, as/cs she/pps said/vbd ,/, only/rb six/cd per/in cent/nn of/in English/jj people/nns are/ber churchgoers/nns ./.
She/pps may/md not/* have/hv been/ben exact/jj on/in this/dt number/nn ,/, but/cc others/nns here/rb feel/vb quite/ql certain/jj that/cs the/at percentage/nn would/md be/be less/ap than/in ten/cd ./.
From/in many/ap sides/nns come/vb remarks/nns that/cs Protestant/jj churches/nns are/ber badly/rb attended/vbn and/cc the/at large/jj medieval/jj cathedrals/nns look/vb all/abn but/in empty/jj during/in services/nns ./.
A/at Catholic/jj priest/nn recently/rb recounted/vbd how/wrb in/in the/at chapel/nn of/in a/at large/jj city/nn university/nn ,/, following/vbg Anglican/jj evensong/nn ,/, at/in which/wdt there/ex was/bedz a/at congregation/nn of/in twelve/cd ,/, he/pps celebrated/vbd Mass/nn-tl before/in more/ap than/in a/at hundred/cd ./.


	The/at Protestant/jj themselves/ppls are/ber the/at first/od to/to admit/vb the/at great/jj falling/nn off/rp in/in effective/jj membership/nn in/in their/pp$ churches/nns ./.
According/in to/in a/at newspaper/nn report/nn of/in the/at 1961/cd statistics/nns of/in the/at Church/nn-tl of/in-tl England/np-tl ,/, the/at ``/`` total/nn of/in confirmed/vbn members/nns is/bez 9,748,000/cd ,/, but/cc only/rb 2,887,671/cd are/ber registered/vbn on/in the/at parochial/jj church/nn rolls/nns ''/'' ,/, and/cc ``/`` over/rp 27/cd million/cd people/nns in/in England/np are/ber baptized/vbn into/in the/at Church/nn-tl of/in-tl England/np-tl ,/, but/cc roughly/rb only/rb a/at tenth/od of/in them/ppo continue/vb ''/'' ./.
An/at amazing/jj article/nn in/in the/at Manchester/np-tl Guardian/nn-tl of/in last/ap November/np ,/, entitled/vbn ``/`` Fate/nn-tl Of/in-tl Redundant/jj-tl Churches/nns-tl ''/'' ,/, states/vbz than/cs an/at Archbishops'/nns$-tl Commission/nn-tl ``/`` reported/vbd last/ap month/nn that/cs in/in the/at Church/nn-tl of/in-tl England/np-tl alone/rb there/ex are/ber 790/cd churches/nns which/wdt are/ber redundant/jj now/rb ,/, or/cc will/md be/be in/in 20/cd years'/nns$ time/nn ./.
A/at further/jjr 260/cd Anglican/jj churches/nns have/hv been/ben demolished/vbn since/in 1948/cd ''/'' ./.

	While/cs it/pps must/md be/be said/vbn that/cs these/dts same/ap Protestants/nps have/hv built/vbn some/dti new/jj churches/nns during/in this/dt period/nn ,/, and/cc that/cs religious/jj population/nn shifts/nns have/hv emptied/vbn churches/nns ,/, a/at principal/jjs reason/nn for/in this/dt phenomenon/nn of/in redundancy/nn is/bez that/cs fewer/ap Protestants/nps are/ber going/vbg to/in church/nn ./.
It/pps should/md be/be admitted/vbn ,/, too/rb ,/, that/cs there/ex is/bez a/at good/jj percentage/nn of/in lapsed/vbn or/cc nonchurchgoing/jj Catholics/nps (/( one/cd paper/nn writes/vbz 50/cd per/in cent/nn )/) ./.
Still/rb ,/, it/pps is/bez clear/jj from/in such/jj reports/nns ,/, and/cc apparently/rb clear/jj from/in the/at remarks/nns of/in many/ap people/nns ,/, that/cs Protestants/nps are/ber decreasing/vbg and/cc Catholics/nps increasing/vbg ./.


	An/at Anglican/jj clergyman/nn in/in Oxford/np sadly/rb but/cc frankly/rb acknowledged/vbd to/in me/ppo that/cs this/dt is/bez true/jj ./.
A/at century/nn ago/rb ,/, Newman/np saw/vbd that/dt liberalism/nn (/( what/wdt we/ppss now/rb might/md call/vb secularism/nn )/) would/md gradually/rb but/cc definitely/rb make/vb its/pp$ mark/nn on/in English/jj Protestantism/np ,/, and/cc that/cs even/rb high/jj Anglicanism/np would/md someday/rb no/ql longer/rbr be/be a/at ``/`` serviceable/jj breakwater/nn against/in doctrinal/jj errors/nns more/ql fundamental/jj than/cs its/pp$ own/jj ''/'' ./.
That/dt day/nn is/bez perhaps/rb today/nr ,/, 1961/cd ,/, and/cc it/pps seems/vbz no/ql longer/rbr very/ql meaningful/jj to/to call/vb England/np a/at ``/`` Protestant/jj country/nn ''/'' ./.
One/cd of/in the/at ironies/nns of/in the/at present/jj crusade/nn for/in Christian/jj unity/nn is/bez that/cs there/ex are/ber not/* ,/, relatively/rb speaking/vbg ,/, many/ap real/jj Christians/nps to/to unite/vb ./.


	Many/ap English/jj Catholics/nps are/ber proud/jj of/in their/pp$ Catholicism/nn-tl and/cc know/vb that/cs they/ppss are/ber in/in a/at new/jj ascendancy/nn ./.
The/at London/np-tl Universe/nn-tl devoted/vbd its/pp$ centenary/nn issue/nn last/ap December/np 8/cd to/in mapping/vbg out/rp various/jj aspects/nns of/in Catholic/jj progress/nn during/in the/at last/ap one/cd hundred/cd years/nns ./.
With/in traditional/jj nationalistic/jj spirit/nn ,/, some/dti Englishmen/nps claim/vb that/cs English/np Catholicism/nn-tl is/bez Catholicism/nn-tl at/in its/pp$ best/jjt ./.
I/ppss have/hv found/vbn myself/ppl saying/vbg with/in other/ap foreigners/nns here/rb that/cs English/np Catholics/nps are/ber good/jj Catholics/nps ./.
It/pps has/hvz been/ben my/pp$ experience/nn to/to find/vb as/ql many/ap men/nns as/cs women/nns in/in church/nn ,/, and/cc to/to hear/vb almost/rb everyone/pn in/in church/nn congregations/nns reciting/vbg the/at Latin/jj prayers/nns and/cc responses/nns at/in Mass/nn-tl ./.


	They/ppss hope/vb ,/, of/in course/nn ,/, to/to reclaim/vb the/at non-Catholic/jj population/nn to/in the/at Catholic/jj faith/nn ,/, and/cc at/in every/at Sunday/nr Benediction/nn-tl they/ppss recite/vb by/in heart/nn the/at ``/`` Prayer/nn-tl for/in England/np-tl ''/'' :/:

''/'' A/at hymn/nn often/rb to/to be/be heard/vbn in/in Catholic/jj churches/nns is/bez ``/`` Faith/nn-tl Of/in-tl Our/pp$-tl Fathers/nns-tl ''/'' ,/, which/wdt glories/vbz in/in England's/np$ ancient/jj faith/nn that/wps endured/vbd persecution/nn ,/, and/cc which/wdt proclaims/vbz :/: ``/`` Faith/nn of/in our/pp$ Fathers/nns-tl :/: Mary's/np$ prayers/nns Shall/md win/vb our/pp$ country/nn back/rb to/in thee/ppo ''/'' ./.

	Because/cs they/ppss have/hv kept/vbn the/at faith/nn of/in their/pp$ medieval/jj fathers/nns ,/, English/jj Catholics/nps have/hv always/rb strongly/rb resented/vbn the/at charge/nn of/in being/beg ``/`` un-English/jj ''/'' ./.
I/ppss have/hv not/* seen/vbn this/dt charge/nn made/vbn during/in my/pp$ stay/nn here/rb ,/, but/cc apparently/rb it/pps is/bez still/rb in/in the/at air/nn ./.
For/in example/nn ,/, a/at writer/nn in/in a/at recent/jj number/nn of/in The/at Queen/nn-tl hyperbolically/rb states/vbz that/cs ``/`` of/in the/at myriad/jj imprecations/nns the/at only/ap one/cd which/wdt the/at English/jj Catholics/nps really/rb resent/vb is/bez the/at suggestion/nn that/cs they/ppss are/ber '/' un-English/jj '/' ''/'' ./.
In/in this/dt connection/nn ,/, it/pps has/hvz been/ben observed/vbn that/cs the/at increasing/vbg number/nn of/in Irish/jj Catholics/nps ,/, priests/nns and/cc laity/nn ,/, in/in England/np ,/, while/cs certainly/rb seen/vbn as/cs good/jj for/in Catholicism/nn-tl ,/, is/bez nevertheless/rb a/at source/nn of/in embarrassment/nn for/in some/dti of/in the/at more/ql nationalistic/jj English/jj Catholics/nps ,/, especially/rb when/wrb these/dts Irishmen/nps offer/vb to/to remind/vb their/pp$ Christian/jj brethren/nns of/in this/dt good/nn ./.




One/cd of/in the/at more/ql noteworthy/jj changes/nns that/wps have/hv taken/vbn place/nn since/in the/at mid-19th/od century/nn is/bez the/at situation/nn of/in Catholics/nps at/in Oxford/np and/cc Cambridge/np-tl Universities/nns-tl ./.
At/in Oxford/np one/cd hundred/cd years/nns ago/rb there/ex were/bed very/ql few/ap Catholics/nps ,/, partly/rb because/cs religious/jj tests/nns were/bed removed/vbn only/rb in/in 1854/cd ./.

	Further/jjr evidence/nn that/cs Roman/jj-tl Catholicism/nn-tl enjoys/vbz a/at more/ql favorable/jj position/nn today/nr than/cs in/in 1861/cd is/bez the/at respectful/jj attention/nn given/vbn to/in it/ppo in/in the/at mass/nn media/nns of/in England/np ./.

On/in successive/jj Sundays/nrs during/in October/np ,/, 1960/cd ,/, Paul/np Ferris/np (/( a/at non-Catholic/np )/) wrote/vbd articles/nns in/in the/at Observer/nn-tl depicting/vbg clergymen/nns of/in the/at Church/nn-tl of/in-tl England/np-tl ,/, the/at Church/nn-tl of/in-tl Rome/np-tl and/cc the/at Nonconformist/nn-tl Church/nn-tl ./.
The/at Catholic/jj priest/nn ,/, though/cs somewhat/ql superficially/rb drawn/vbn ,/, easily/rb came/vbd out/rp the/at best/jjt ./.
