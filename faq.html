      What are the plans for further development of NLTK?

In 2007 there will be releases every 1-2 months, according to the
development schedule </index.php/Development>. The toolkit will be
continued to be supported in 2008 and beyond with bugfixes and
additional functionality, at a rate depending on the level of community
support.

[edit </index.php?title=FAQ&action=edit&section=3>]


      What is the difference between NLTK and NLTK-Lite?

Since mid-2005, the NLTK developers have been creating a lightweight
version of NLTK, called NLTK-Lite. NLTK-Lite is simpler and faster than
NLTK. Once it is complete, NLTK-Lite will provide the same functionality
as NLTK (in fact, all of NLTK functionality is now in NLTK-Lite 0.9, and
the package is called nltk). Unlike the old NLTK, NLTK-Lite does not
impose such a heavy burden on the programmer. Wherever possible,
standard Python objects are used instead of custom NLP versions, so that
students learning to program for the first time will be learning to
program in Python with some useful libraries, rather than learning to
program in NLTK. Once it reaches version 1.0 (in late 2007), NLTK-Lite
will take over the original NLTK name, and become NLTK 2.0.

      I'm planning some long-term research using NLTK; how long is the
      toolkit going to be supported?

We plan to continue supporting the toolkit for as long as possible.
We're publishing a book on NLTK in 2008 and plan to support the toolkit
for several years while the book is in active use, and while the
developers are employed to teach natural language processing. In
particular, bug reports will be attended to as quickly as possible.

[edit </index.php?title=FAQ&action=edit&section=5>]


      I think I found a bug; where do I report it?

Please report any bugs to the NLTK Bug Tracker
<http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=400896&group_id=30982&func=browse>,
giving as much detail as possible. Please include a code sample that
permits us to replicate the problem.

[edit </index.php?title=FAQ&action=edit&section=6>]


      Why is Python giving me a syntax error when I use NLTK?

NLTK requires Python version 2.4 or later. If you use an earlier version
of Python you will see lots of syntax errors.

[edit </index.php?title=FAQ&action=edit&section=7>]


      How can I install NLTK from the source code repository?

Most users should install NLTK from a distribution. Please see the
installation instructions </index.php/Installation>. However, if you
need an up-to-the-minute version, then you will have to install NLTK
from the source repository. You'll need to have a Subversion client
installed on your machine, then check out the main branch from
https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/nltk/trunk/nltk. For more details,
please see the NLTK Subversion Instructions
<http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=30982>. Once you've downloaded
this, you'll need to run the top level setup.py program to install this
version of NLTK on your machine.

[edit </index.php?title=FAQ&action=edit&section=8>]


      How can I find out where NLTK is installed on my system?

Do the following in a Python interpreter session. In this case we see
that NLTK is installed in /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/nltk

>>> import nltk
>>> print nltk
<module 'nltk' from '/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/nltk/__init__.pyc'>

      What papers have been published about NLTK?

NLTK has been presented at several academic conferences, and reviewed in
online forums. Please see the Documentation </index.php/Documentation>
page for more information.

      How is NLTK development supported?

NLTK is an open source project that depends mainly on the efforts of
volunteers. Occasionally we have funds for a summer intern or TA to work
on specified projects. Students and teachers also donate code. Recently,
we have received support from /Google Summer of Code/. We strongly
encourage volunteers to get involved: find out more about contributing
to NLTK </index.php/Contribute>. If you find the toolkit useful, please
make a donation </index.php/Donate> to support further development.

      How did NLTK start?

The NLTK project began when Steven Bird was teaching CIS-530 at the
University of Pennsylvania in 2001, and hired his star student, Edward
Loper, from the previous offering of the course to be the teaching
assistant (TA). They agreed a plan for developing software
infrastructure for NLP teaching that could be easily maintained over
time. Edward wrote up the plan
<http://nltk.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/*checkout*/nltk/trunk/nltk-old/doc/technical/proposal/proposal.tex?revision=2975&content-type=text%2Fplain>,
and both began work on it right away. Here is the Version 0.2 release
announcement
<http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=22772&forum_id=960>
that appeared in September 2001.

      If I just "use" NLTK using import statements in Python, am I
      obliged to publish my source code as well?

No, there is no such obligation. Please see section 2 /Basic
Permissions/ in the Gnu Public License
