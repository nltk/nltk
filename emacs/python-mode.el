;;; Commentary:

;; This is a major mode for editing Python programs.  It was developed by Tim
;; Peters after an original idea by Michael A. Guravage.  Tim subsequently
;; left the net and in 1995, Barry Warsaw inherited the mode.  Tim's now back
;; but disavows all responsibility for the mode.  In fact, we suspect he
;; doesn't even use Emacs any more.  In 2003, python-mode.el was moved to its
;; own SourceForge project apart from the Python project, and now is
;; maintained by the volunteers at the python-mode@python.org mailing list.

;; pdbtrack support contributed by Ken Manheimer, April 2001.  Skip Montanaro
;; has also contributed significantly to python-mode's development.

;; Please use the SourceForge Python project to submit bugs or
;; patches:
;;
;;     http://sourceforge.net/projects/python

;; INSTALLATION:

;; To install, just drop this file into a directory on your load-path and
;; byte-compile it.  To set up Emacs to automatically edit files ending in
;; ".py" using python-mode add the following to your ~/.emacs file (GNU
;; Emacs) or ~/.xemacs/init.el file (XEmacs):
;;    (setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.py$" . python-mode) auto-mode-alist))
;;    (setq interpreter-mode-alist (cons '("python" . python-mode)
;;                                       interpreter-mode-alist))
;;    (autoload 'python-mode "python-mode" "Python editing mode." t)
;;
;; In XEmacs syntax highlighting should be enabled automatically.  In GNU
;; Emacs you may have to add these lines to your ~/.emacs file:
;;    (global-font-lock-mode t)
;;    (setq font-lock-maximum-decoration t)

;; FOR MORE INFORMATION:

;; There is some information on python-mode.el at

;;     http://www.python.org/emacs/python-mode/
;;
;; It does contain links to other packages that you might find useful,
;; such as pdb interfaces, OO-Browser links, etc.

;; BUG REPORTING:

;; As mentioned above, please use the SourceForge Python project for
;; submitting bug reports or patches.  The old recommendation, to use
;; C-c C-b will still work, but those reports have a higher chance of
;; getting buried in my mailbox.  Please include a complete, but
;; concise code sample and a recipe for reproducing the bug.  Send
;; suggestions and other comments to python-mode@python.org.

;; When in a Python mode buffer, do a C-h m for more help.  It's
;; doubtful that a texinfo manual would be very useful, but if you
;; want to contribute one, I'll certainly accept it!

When this variable is non-nil, two things happen when a buffer is set

       Only guessed values between 2 and 8 are considered.  If a valid
       guess can't be made (perhaps because you are visiting a new
       file), then the value in `py-indent-offset' is used.

    2. `indent-tabs-mode' is turned off if `py-indent-offset' does not
       equal `tab-width' (`indent-tabs-mode' is never turned on by
       Python mode).  This means that for newly written code, tabs are
       only inserted in indentation if one tab is one indentation
       level, otherwise only spaces are used.

Note that both these settings occur *after* `python-mode-hook' is run,
so if you want to defeat the automagic configuration, you must also
set `py-smart-indentation' to nil in your `python-mode-hook'."

  "Start an interactive Python interpreter in another window.
This is like Shell mode, except that Python is running in the window
instead of a shell.  See the `Interactive Shell' and `Shell Mode'
sections of the Emacs manual for details, especially for the key
bindings active in the `*Python*' buffer.

With optional \\[universal-argument], the user is prompted for the
flags to pass to the Python interpreter.  This has no effect when this
command is used to switch to an existing process, only when a new
process is started.  If you use this, you will probably want to ensure
that the current arguments are retained (they will be included in the
prompt).  This argument is ignored when this function is called
programmatically, or when running in Emacs 19.34 or older.

Note: You can toggle between using the CPython interpreter and the
Jython interpreter by hitting \\[py-toggle-shells].  This toggles
buffer local variables which control whether all your subshell
interactions happen to the `*Jython*' or `*Python*' buffers (the
latter is the name used for the CPython buffer).

Warning: Don't use an interactive Python if you change sys.ps1 or
sys.ps2 from their default values, or if you're running code that
prints `>>> ' or `... ' at the start of a line.  `python-mode' can't
distinguish your output from Python's output, and assumes that `>>> '
at the start of a line is a prompt from Python.  Similarly, the Emacs
Shell mode code assumes that both `>>> ' and `... ' at the start of a
line are Python prompts.  Bad things can happen if you fool either
mode.

Warning:  If you do any editing *in* the process buffer *while* the
buffer is accepting output from Python, do NOT attempt to `undo' the
changes.  Some of the output (nowhere near the parts you changed!) may
be lost if you do.  This appears to be an Emacs bug, an unfortunate
interaction between undo and process filters; the same problem exists in
non-Python process buffers using the default (Emacs-supplied) process
filter."

is called!  This function does not compute proper indentation from
scratch (that's impossible in Python), it merely adjusts the existing
indentation to be correct in context.

Warning: This function really has no idea what to do with
non-indenting comment lines, and shifts them as if they were indenting
comment lines.  Fixing this appears to require telepathy.

Special cases: whitespace is deleted from blank lines; continuation
lines are shifted by the same amount their initial line was shifted,

;; Functions for marking regions
(defun py-mark-block (&optional extend just-move)
  "Mark following block of lines.  With prefix arg, mark structure.
Easier to use than explain.  It sets the region to an `interesting'
block of succeeding lines.  If point is on a blank line, it goes down to
the next non-blank line.  That will be the start of the region.  The end
of the region depends on the kind of line at the start:

 - If a comment, the region will include all succeeding comment lines up
   to (but not including) the next non-comment line (if any).

 - Else if a prefix arg is given, and the line begins one of these
   structures:

     if elif else try except finally for while def class

   the region will be set to the body of the structure, including
   following blocks that `belong' to it, but excluding trailing blank
   and comment lines.  E.g., if on a `try' statement, the `try' block
   and all (if any) of the following `except' and `finally' blocks
   that belong to the `try' structure will be in the region.  Ditto
   for if/elif/else, for/else and while/else structures, and (a bit
   degenerate, since they're always one-block structures) def and
   class blocks.

 - Else if no prefix argument is given, and the line begins a Python
   block (see list above), and the block is not a `one-liner' (i.e.,
   the statement ends with a colon, not with code), the region will
   include all succeeding lines up to (but not including) the next
   code statement (if any) that's indented no more than the starting
   line, except that trailing blank and comment lines are excluded.
   E.g., if the starting line begins a multi-statement `def'
   structure, the region will be set to the full function definition,
   but without any trailing `noise' lines.

 - Else the region will include all succeeding lines up to (but not
   including) the next blank line, or code or indenting-comment line
   indented strictly less than the starting line.  Trailing indenting
   comment lines are included in this case, but not trailing blank
   lines.

area; or do `\\[exchange-point-and-mark]' to flip down to the end.

  "Set region to body of def (or class, with prefix arg) enclosing point.
Pushes the current mark, then point, on the mark ring (all language
modes do this, but although it's handy it's never documented ...).

In most Emacs language modes, this function bears at least a
hallucinogenic resemblance to `\\[py-end-of-def-or-class]' and
`\\[py-beginning-of-def-or-class]'.

And in earlier versions of Python mode, all 3 were tightly connected.
Turned out that was more confusing than useful: the `goto start' and
`goto end' commands are usually used to search through a file, and
people expect them to act a lot like `search backward' and `search
forward' string-search commands.  But because Python `def' and `class'
can nest to arbitrary levels, finding the smallest def containing
point cannot be done via a simple backward search: the def containing
point may not be the closest preceding def, or even the closest
preceding def that's indented less.  The fancy algorithm required is
appropriate for the usual uses of this `mark' command, but not for the
`goto' variations.

So the def marked by this command may not be the one either of the
`goto' commands find: If point is on a blank or non-indenting comment
line, moves back to start of the closest preceding code statement or
indenting comment line.  If this is a `def' statement, that's the def
we use.  Else searches for the smallest enclosing `def' block and uses
that.  Else signals an error.

When an enclosing def is found: The mark is left immediately beyond
the last line of the def block.  Point is left at the start of the
def, except that: if the def is preceded by a number of comment lines
followed by (at most) one optional blank line, point is left at the
start of the comments; else if the def is preceded by a blank line,
point is left at its start.

The intent is to mark the containing def/class and its associated
documentation, to make moving and duplicating functions and classes
pleasant."

%v:py-python-command
%v:py-temp-directory
%v:py-beep-if-tab-change

@KINDS OF LINES

Each physical line in the file is either a `continuation line' (the
preceding line ends with a backslash that's not part of a comment, or
the paren/bracket/brace nesting level at the start of the line is
non-zero, or both) or an `initial line' (everything else).

An initial line is in turn a `blank line' (contains nothing except
possibly blanks or tabs), a `comment line' (leftmost non-blank
character is `#'), or a `code line' (everything else).

Comment Lines

Although all comment lines are treated alike by Python, Python mode
recognizes two kinds that act differently with respect to indentation.

An `indenting comment line' is a comment line with a blank, tab or
nothing after the initial `#'.  The indentation commands (see below)
treat these exactly as if they were code lines: a line following an
indenting comment line will be indented like the comment line.  All
other comment lines (those with a non-whitespace character immediately
following the initial `#') are `non-indenting comment lines', and
their indentation is ignored by the indentation commands.

Indenting comment lines are by far the usual case, and should be used
whenever possible.  Non-indenting comment lines are useful in cases
like these:

\ta = b   # a very wordy single-line comment that ends up being
\t        #... continued onto another line

\tif a == b:
##\t\tprint 'panic!' # old code we've `commented out'
\t\treturn a

Since the `#...' and `##' comment lines have a non-whitespace
character following the initial `#', Python mode ignores them when
computing the proper indentation for the next line.

Continuation Lines and Statements

The Python-mode commands generally work on statements instead of on
individual lines, where a `statement' is a comment or blank line, or a
code line and all of its following continuation lines (if any)
considered as a single logical unit.  The commands in this mode
generally (when it makes sense) automatically move to the start of the
statement containing point, even if point happens to be in the middle
of some continuation line.


@INDENTATION

Primarily for entering new code:
\t\\[indent-for-tab-command]\t indent line appropriately
\t\\[py-newline-and-indent]\t insert newline, then indent
\t\\[py-electric-backspace]\t reduce indentation, or delete single character

Primarily for reindenting existing code:
\t\\[py-guess-indent-offset]\t guess py-indent-offset from file content; change locally
\t\\[universal-argument] \\[py-guess-indent-offset]\t ditto, but change globally

\t\\[py-indent-region]\t reindent region to match its context
\t\\[py-shift-region-left]\t shift region left by py-indent-offset
\t\\[py-shift-region-right]\t shift region right by py-indent-offset

Unlike most programming languages, Python uses indentation, and only
indentation, to specify block structure.  Hence the indentation supplied
automatically by Python-mode is just an educated guess:  only you know
the block structure you intend, so only you can supply correct
indentation.

The \\[indent-for-tab-command] and \\[py-newline-and-indent] keys try to suggest plausible indentation, based on
the indentation of preceding statements.  E.g., assuming
py-indent-offset is 4, after you enter
\tif a > 0: \\[py-newline-and-indent]
the cursor will be moved to the position of the `_' (_ is not a
character in the file, it's just used here to indicate the location of
the cursor):
\tif a > 0:
\t    _
If you then enter `c = d' \\[py-newline-and-indent], the cursor will move
to
\tif a > 0:
\t    c = d
\t    _
Python-mode cannot know whether that's what you intended, or whether
\tif a > 0:
\t    c = d
\t_
was your intent.  In general, Python-mode either reproduces the
indentation of the (closest code or indenting-comment) preceding
statement, or adds an extra py-indent-offset blanks if the preceding
statement has `:' as its last significant (non-whitespace and non-
comment) character.  If the suggested indentation is too much, use
\\[py-electric-backspace] to reduce it.

Continuation lines are given extra indentation.  If you don't like the
suggested indentation, change it to something you do like, and Python-
mode will strive to indent later lines of the statement in the same way.

If a line is a continuation line by virtue of being in an unclosed
paren/bracket/brace structure (`list', for short), the suggested
indentation depends on whether the current line contains the first item
in the list.  If it does, it's indented py-indent-offset columns beyond
the indentation of the line containing the open bracket.  If you don't
like that, change it by hand.  The remaining items in the list will mimic
whatever indentation you give to the first item.

If a line is a continuation line because the line preceding it ends with
a backslash, the third and following lines of the statement inherit their
indentation from the line preceding them.  The indentation of the second
line in the statement depends on the form of the first (base) line:  if
the base line is an assignment statement with anything more interesting
than the backslash following the leftmost assigning `=', the second line
is indented two columns beyond that `='.  Else it's indented to two
columns beyond the leftmost solid chunk of non-whitespace characters on
the base line.

Warning:  indent-region should not normally be used!  It calls \\[indent-for-tab-command]
repeatedly, and as explained above, \\[indent-for-tab-command] can't guess the block
structure you intend.
%c:indent-for-tab-command
%c:py-newline-and-indent
%c:py-electric-backspace


The next function may be handy when editing code you didn't write:
%c:py-guess-indent-offset


The remaining `indent' functions apply to a region of Python code.  They
assume the block structure (equals indentation, in Python) of the region
is correct, and alter the indentation in various ways while preserving
the block structure:
%c:py-indent-region
%c:py-shift-region-left
%c:py-shift-region-right

@MARKING & MANIPULATING REGIONS OF CODE

\\[py-mark-block]\t mark block of lines
\\[py-mark-def-or-class]\t mark smallest enclosing def
\\[universal-argument] \\[py-mark-def-or-class]\t mark smallest enclosing class
\\[comment-region]\t comment out region of code
\\[universal-argument] \\[comment-region]\t uncomment region of code
%c:py-mark-block
%c:py-mark-def-or-class
%c:comment-region

@MOVING POINT

\\[py-previous-statement]\t move to statement preceding point
\\[py-next-statement]\t move to statement following point
\\[py-goto-block-up]\t move up to start of current block
\\[py-beginning-of-def-or-class]\t move to start of def
\\[universal-argument] \\[py-beginning-of-def-or-class]\t move to start of class
\\[py-end-of-def-or-class]\t move to end of def
\\[universal-argument] \\[py-end-of-def-or-class]\t move to end of class

The first two move to one statement beyond the statement that contains
point.  A numeric prefix argument tells them to move that many
statements instead.  Blank lines, comment lines, and continuation lines
do not count as `statements' for these commands.  So, e.g., you can go
to the first code statement in a file by entering
\t\\[beginning-of-buffer]\t to move to the top of the file
\t\\[py-next-statement]\t to skip over initial comments and blank lines
Or do `\\[py-previous-statement]' with a huge prefix argument.
%c:py-previous-statement
%c:py-next-statement
%c:py-goto-block-up
%c:py-beginning-of-def-or-class
%c:py-end-of-def-or-class

@LITTLE-KNOWN EMACS COMMANDS PARTICULARLY USEFUL IN PYTHON MODE

`\\[indent-new-comment-line]' is handy for entering a multi-line comment.

`\\[set-selective-display]' with a `small' prefix arg is ideally suited for viewing the
overall class and def structure of a module.

`\\[back-to-indentation]' moves point to a line's first non-blank character.

`\\[indent-relative]' is handy for creating odd indentation.

@OTHER EMACS HINTS

If you don't like the default value of a variable, change its value to
whatever you do like by putting a `setq' line in your .emacs file.
E.g., to set the indentation increment to 4, put this line in your
.emacs:
\t(setq  py-indent-offset  4)
To see the value of a variable, do `\\[describe-variable]' and enter the variable
name at the prompt.

When entering a key sequence like `C-c C-n', it is not necessary to
release the CONTROL key after doing the `C-c' part -- it suffices to
press the CONTROL key, press and release `c' (while still holding down
CONTROL), press and release `n' (while still holding down CONTROL), &
then release CONTROL.

Entering Python mode calls with no arguments the value of the variable
`python-mode-hook', if that value exists and is not nil; for backward
compatibility it also tries `py-mode-hook'; see the `Hooks' section of
the Elisp manual for details.

Obscure:  When python-mode is first loaded, it looks for all bindings
to newline-and-indent in the global keymap, and shadows them with
local bindings to py-newline-and-indent."))
