"""
A collection of methods for tree (grammar) transformations used
in parsing natural language.  

Although many of these methods are technically grammar transformations
(ie. Chomsky Norm Form), when working with treebanks it is much more
natural to visualize these modifications in a tree structure.  Hence,
we will do all transformation directly to the tree itself.
Transforming the tree directly also allows us to do parent annotation.
A grammar can then be simply induced from the modified tree.

The following is a short tutorial on the available transformations.

1) Chomsky Normal Form (binarization)

  It is well known that any grammar has a Chomsky Normal Form (CNF)
  equivalent grammar where CNF is defined by every production having
  either two non-terminals or one terminal on its right hand side.
  When we have hierarchically structured data (ie. a treebank), it is
  natural to view this in terms of productions where the root of every
  subtree is the head (left hand side) of the production and all of
  its children are the right hand side constituents.  In order to
  convert a tree into CNF, we simply need to ensure that every subtree
  has either two subtrees as children (binarization), or one leaf node
  (non-terminal).  In order to binarize a subtree with more than two
  children, we must introduce artificial nodes.

  There are two popular methods to convert a tree into CNF: left
  factoring and right factoring.  The following example demonstrates
  the difference between them.

  |          Original       Right-Factored     Left-Factored
  |
  |  Example:     A              A                      A 
  |             / | \          /   \                  /   \
  |            B  C  D   ==>  B    A|<C-D>   OR   A|<B-C>  D 
  |                                 /  \          /  \
  |                                C    D        B    C

2) Parent Annotation

  In addition to binarizing the tree, there are two standard
  modifications to node labels we can do in the same traversal: parent
  annotation and Markov order-N smoothing (or sibling smoothing).

  The purpose of parent annotation is to refine the probabilities of
  productions by adding a small amount of context.  With this simple
  addition, a CYK (inside-outside, dynamic programming chart parse)
  can improve from 74% to 79% accuracy.  A natural generalization from
  parent annotation is to grandparent annotation and beyond.  The
  tradeoff becomes accuracy gain vs. computational complexity.  We
  must also keep in mind data sparcity issues.

  |          Original       Parent Annotation 
  |
  |  Example:     A                A^<?>            
  |             / | \             /   \            
  |            B  C  D   ==>  B^<A>    A|<C-D>^<?>     where ? is the parent of A
  |                                      /  \        
  |                                  C^<A>   D^<A>   


3) Markov order-N smoothing

  Markov smoothing combats data sparcity issues as well as decreasing
  computational requirements by limiting the number of children
  included in artificial nodes.  In practice, most people use an order
  2 grammar.

  |             Original          No Smoothing        Markov order 1     Markov order 2   etc...
  |
  |  Example:       A                A                       A                A 
  |            /  / | \  \         /   \                   /   \            /   \
  |           B  C  D  E  F  ==>  B    A|<C-D-E-F>   ==>  B   A|<C>  ==>   B  A|<C-D>
  |                                      /   \                /   \            /   \
  |                                     C    ...             C    ...         C    ...

  Annotation decisions can be thought about in the vertical direction
  (parent, grandparent, etc) and the horizontal direction (number of
  siblings to keep).  Parameters to the following functions specify
  these values.  For more information see:

  Dan Klein and Chris Manning (2003) "Accurate Unlexicalized Parsing", ACL-03.
  http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P03-1054
    
4) Unary Collapsing  

  Collapse unary productions (ie. subtrees with a single child) into a
  new non-terminal (Tree node).  This is useful when working with
  algorithms that do not allow unary productions, yet you do not wish
  to lose the parent information.

  |              A         
  |              |
  |  Example:    B   ==>   A+B
  |             / \        / \
  |            C   D      C   D
