| 
| 4. Relevant Information:n
|       Vina conducted a comparison test of her rule-based system, BEAGLE, the
|       nearest-neighbor algorithm, and discriminant analysis.  BEAGLE is 
|       a product available through VRS Consulting, Inc.; 4676 Admiralty Way,
|       Suite 206; Marina Del Ray, CA 90292 (213) 827-7890 and FAX: -3189.
|       In determining whether the glass was a type of "float" glass or not,
|       the following results were obtained (# incorrect answers):
| 
|              Type of Sample                            Beagle   NN    DA
|              Windows that were float processed (87)     10      12    21
|              Windows that were not:            (76)     19      16    22
| 
|       The study of classification of types of glass was motivated by 
|       criminological investigation.  At the scene of the crime, the glass left
|       can be used as evidence...if it is correctly identified!
