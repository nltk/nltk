Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Python
    ~~~~~~
    The natural language toolkit requires Python 2.4 or higher.  To
    check what version of Python you are running, run:
        % python -V

    Alternatively, run an interactive Python installation session, and
    check which version it reports.

    You can download the latest version of Python from:
        <http://www.python.org/download>

    Other Packages
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    The natural language toolkit makes use of several other open
    source Python packages.  These packages are not required to use
    much of Python's core functionality.  However, without them you
    won't be able to use some features (such as graphical demos).  The
    following packages are currently used by the natural language
    toolkit:

        - Tkinter ("Tk interface"): the standard Python interface to
          the Tk GUI toolkit.  This is usually installed by default
          under Windows, but you may need to install it separately
          if you are using Unix or a Macintosh.  Tkinter should be 
          included in your version of Python.  A RedHat 7.1 RPM is
          also available:
            <http://www.python.org/2.1.1/rpms.html>
        - Numarray: adds a fast array facility to the Python language. 
            <http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1369&package_id=32367>
 
Windows Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    After you have installed Python, run the NLTK installation file
    (nltk-??.??.win32.exe).  The installation wizard will guide you
    through the installation process.

    Upgrading
    ~~~~~~~~~
    When upgrading the version of NLTK you are using, the installation
    wizard will ask you if you wish to overwrite the old NLTK files.
    Answer "yes."

RPM Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    If you are running a RedHat, SuSE, or a compatible Linux distribution,
    you can install NLTK from the RPM:

        % rpm -i nltk-??.??-1.noarch.rpm

    If you wish to build an RPM for NLTK on other Linux systems,
    you can use the SRPM:

        % rpm --rebuild nltk-??.??-1.noarch.rpm

Unix and Macintosch (OS X) Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    You can manually install the toolkit from the .tar.gz file:

        gunzip nltk-??.??.tar.gz 
        tar -xvf nltk-??.??.tar
        cd nltk-??.??
        python setup.py install

    You can also manually install the toolkit from the .zip file:

        unzip nltk-??.??.zip
        cd nltk-??.??
        python setup.py install

Alternate Install Locations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    If you are unable to install NLTK on your system (e.g., because
    you are not a system administrator), then you can install it to
    an alternate location, and use your PYTHONPATH to let Python
    know where to find it.  To install to an alternate location,
    use the "--prefix" argument to setup.py:

        python setup.py install --prefix=<dir>

    Once you have installed it, you will need to adjust your
    PYTHONPATH to point to the install directory:

        export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:<dir>     # for sh or bash
        setenv PYTHONPATH $PYTHONPATH:<dir>     # for csh or tcsh

    (For Windows, right click on "My Computer" and select "Properties
    -> Advanced -> Environment Variables -> New User Variable.")

    For more information on installing to an alternate location, see
    the distutils manual:
