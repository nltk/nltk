\item Capture constituency and ordering;
\item formalise descriptive linguistic work of the 1940s and '50s;
\item are widely used in linguistics.
%\item We'll need something else for capturing grammatical relations and dependency relations.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
% \item CFGs don't directly encode grammatical relations (such as \Em{subject}
% of a verb) or dependency relations (such as \Em{head} of a clause);
% however, to a certain extent, they can be defined in terms of
% constituency.

\item CFGs are somewhat biased towards languages like English which have
relatively fixed word order.

\item Most modern linguistic theories of grammar incorporate some notions from
context free grammar.
\end{itemize}


\end{frame}

\subsection{Some Definitions}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Context Free Grammars (CFGs)}

Formally, a CFG is a 4-tuple $\langle N, \Sigma, P, S\rangle$, where
\begin{itemize}
\item $N$ is a set of non-terminal symbols (e.g., syntactic categories)
\item $\Sigma$ a set of terminal symbols (e.g., words)
\item $P$ a set of productions (rules) of the form  $A \rightarrow \alpha$, where

\begin{itemize}
\item $A$ is a non-terminal, and
\item $\alpha$ is a string of symbols from the set
%$(\mysum \bigcup N )^\star$
$(\Sigma \cup N )^\star$ (i.e., both terminals and non-terminals)
\end{itemize}
\item  a designated start symbol $S$
\end{itemize}

%CFGs are equivalent to Backus-Naur form (BNF) grammars.


\end{frame}
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Example CFG}
Let $G = \langle N, \Sigma, P, S\rangle$, where
\begin{itemize}
\item $N$ = \{\Se, \NP, \VP, \Det, \Nom, \V, \N\}
\item $\Sigma$ = \{\ling{a}, \ling{flight}, \ling{left}\}
\item $P$ = \{
  \begin{tabular}[t]{l}
  \Se\ $\rightarrow$ \NP \,\, \VP,\\
  \NP\ $\rightarrow$ \Det \,\, \Nom,\\
  \Nom\ $\rightarrow$ \N,\\
  \VP\ $\rightarrow$ \V,\\
  \Det\ $\rightarrow$ \ling{a},\\
  \N\ $\rightarrow$ \ling{flight},\\
  \V\ $\rightarrow$ \ling{left} \,\, \}
  \end{tabular}

\item $S$ = \Se.
\end{itemize}

\NP\ = `noun phrase', \VP\ = `verb phrase', \Det\ = `determiner', \Nom\
= `Nominal', \N\ =
`noun', \V\ = `verb'.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Derivations}

\begin{itemize}
\item A \Em{derivation} of a string from non-terminal $A$ is the
  result of successively applying productions (from $G$) to $A$:\\

\bigskip
  \begin{tabular}[t]{|c||l|} \hline
    \NP &\\
    \Det \, \Nom &  by \NP $\rightarrow$ \Det \,\, \Nom\\
    \ling{a} \, \Nom & by \Det $\rightarrow$ \ling{a}\\
    \ling{a} \, \N & by \Nom $\rightarrow$ \N \\
    \ling{a} \, \ling{flight} & by \N $\rightarrow$ \ling{flight} \\\hline
  \end{tabular}
\bigskip
\item Can also write: \NP $\Rightarrow$ \Det \, \Nom $\Rightarrow$ 
\ling{a} \, \Nom $\Rightarrow$ \ling{a} \, \N $\Rightarrow$ \ling{a} \, \ling{flight}, where
$\Rightarrow$ means ``directly derives'' or ``yields in one rule application''.

\item $G$ generates \ling{a flight} (as a string of category \NP).

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Grammars and Languages}

\begin{itemize}
\item CFG is an abstract model for associating structures with
  strings;
\item \textbf{not} intended as model of how humans produce sentences.


\item Sentences that can be \Em{derived} by a grammar $G$ belong to the
  formal language defined by $G$, and are called
  \Em{Grammatical Sentences} with respect to $G$.

\item Sentences that cannot be derived by $G$ are \Em{Ungrammatical
    Sentences} with respect to $G$..

\item The language $L_G$ defined by grammar $G$ is the set
  of strings composed of terminal symbols that are derivable from the
  \Em{start symbol}: \( L_G \eq \{w | w \in \Sigma^\star \text{ and }
  S \; \text{derives} \; w\} \)


\end{itemize}
%(see Chapter 10).
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Trees}


\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Parse Trees}

\begin{itemize}

\item Derivations can also be visualized as \Em{parse trees} (or
  \Em{constituent structure} trees), e.g.  

{\small
  \medskip

  \synttree[\NP [\Det [\ling{a}]] [\Nom [\N [\ling{flight}]]]]

  \medskip
}

\item Trees express:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item hierarchical grouping into constituents
  \item grammatical category of constituents
  \item left-to-right order of constituents
  \end{itemize}


\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Parse Trees, cont.}

\begin{itemize}



\item Trees can also be written as labeled bracketings:\\

\begin{verbatim} 
[NP 
   [Det a] 
   [Nom [N flight]]]
\end{verbatim}

\item \textbf{Dominance}: node $x$ \Em{dominates} node $y$ if there's a
      connected sequence of branches descending from $x$ to $y$. E.g.
      \begin{itemize}
      \item \NP\ dominates non-terminals \Det, \Nom\ and \N
      \end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Immediate Dominance}: node $x$ \Em{immediately
      dominates} node $y$ if $x$ dominates $y$ and there's no distinct
      node between $x$ and $y$.
 E.g.
      \begin{itemize}
      \item \NP\ immediately dominates  \Det\ and \Nom.
      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Parse Trees, cont.}

{\small
\branchheight{4ex}
  \synttree[\NP [\Det [\ling{a}]] [\Nom [\N [\ling{flight}]]]]
}

\begin{itemize}

\item A node is called the \Em{daughter} of the node which immediately
      dominates it.
    
\item Distinct nodes immediately dominated by the same node are called
      \Em{sisters}.

\item A node which is not dominated by any other node is called the
      \Em{root} node.

\item Nodes which do not dominate any other nodes are called \Em{leaves}.


\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


% \begin{frame}[fragile]
% \frametitle{Equivalence and Normal Form}

% \Em{Strong Equivalence}

% \begin{itemize}
% \item Two grammars generate the same set of strings and assign the
%   same phrase structures
% \end{itemize}

% \Em{Weak Equivalence
% }
% \begin{itemize}
% \item  Two grammars generate the same set of strings but do
% \emph{not} assign the same phrase structures
% \end{itemize}

% \Em{Chomsky Normal Form} (CNF)
% \begin{itemize}
% \item All productions of the form $A \rightarrow B \, C$ or
%   $A \rightarrow a $, where 
% \item  upper case indicates non-­terminals, lowercase indicates
% terminals
% \end{itemize}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% %
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% \end{frame}
% \begin{frame}[fragile]
% \frametitle{Equivalence and Normal Form:  Example}

% Original
% \begin{itemize}
% \item  $A \rightarrow \,\, B \,\, C \,\, D$
% \end{itemize}

% CNF
% \begin{itemize}
% \item $A \rightarrow B \,\, X$
% \item $X \rightarrow C \,\, D$
% \end{itemize}

% What type of equivalence?
% \end{frame}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% %
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


% \begin{frame}[fragile]
% \frametitle{What's this `Context'?}

% \begin{itemize}
% \item The use of the term \Em{context free} in the description of CFGs
%   formalism has nothing to do with the ordinary use of the word
%   ``context''.


% \item All it really means is that there is a single non-terminal on the
%   left-hand side of the rule, e.g.,\\
%   $A \rightarrow B \,\, C$


% \item In other words, we can rewrite an $A$ as $B \,\,C$, regardless of
%   the (string/tree) context in which we find the $A$.

% \end{itemize}

% \end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{CFG: As opposed to what?}

\begin{itemize}
\item Regular Grammars:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item All rules of the form $A \rightarrow x B$ or $A \rightarrow x$.
  \item Equivalent to Regular Expressions.
  \item Regarded as too weak to capture lingistic
    generalizations.
  \end{itemize}
  
\item Context Sensitive Grammars:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Allows rules of the form $X A Y \rightarrow X \alpha Y$; i.e.,
        the way in which $A$ is expanded can depend on the context $X
        \underline{\,\,\,} Y$.
  \item Regarded as 'too strong' --- can describe languages that aren't possible human languages.
  \item Regular languages $\subset$ Context Free languages  $\subset$
        Context Sensitive languages
  \end{itemize}
  
% \item Recursively Enumerable (Type 0) Grammars --- generally regarded as
%   way too strong. 
% (But it has sometimes be suggested that NLs aren't
%   even RE!)
% \item RE vs.\ Recursive --- we seem to know when strings are ungrammatical.
\end{itemize}

% Approaches that are \Em{too strong} have the power to
% predict/describe/capture syntactic structures that don't exist in
% human languages. However, it is generally agreed that CFGs aren't quite
% strong enough.

% The computational processes associated with stronger formalisms are not
% as efficient as those associated with weaker methods.

\section{Example CFG for English}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Grammars and Constituency}

\begin{itemize}
\item A huge amount of skilled effort goes into the development of
  grammars for human languages --- can only scratch the surface here.

\item There's lot's of research into English syntactic structure --- but also lots of disagreement.

\item Various criteria for determining constituency:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item substitution by pro-forms
  \item preposing
  \item constituent answers
  \item coordination
  \end{itemize}

\item Some clear-cut decisions, but quite a lot of unclear ones too.


% \item Our primary question: What constitutes a constituent?

% \item \textbf{Answer}: A consistent, recurring, syntactic substructure.

\subsection{Agreement}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Number Agreement}

In English, some determiners agree in number with the head noun:
\begin{itemize}
\item \ling{This dog}
\item \ling{Those dogs}
\item \bad \ling{Those dog}
\item \bad \ling{This dogs}
\end{itemize}

And verbs agree in number with their subjects:
\begin{itemize}
\item \ling{What flights leave in the morning?}
\item \bad \ling{What flight leave in the morning?}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Number Agreement, cont.}

%\vspace{-2ex}

Expand our grammar with multiple sets of rules?

\NP$_\text{sg}$ $\rightarrow$ \Det$_\text{sg}$ \N$_\text{sg}$

\NP$_\text{pl}$ $\rightarrow$ \Det$_\text{pl}$ \N$_\text{pl}$

\Se$_\text{sg}$ $\rightarrow$ \NP$_\text{sg}$ \VP$_\text{sg}$

\Se$_\text{pl}$ $\rightarrow$ \NP$_\text{pl}$ \VP$_\text{pl}$

\VP$_\text{sg}$ $\rightarrow$ \V$_\text{sg}$ (\NP) (\NP) (\PP)

\VP$_\text{pl}$ $\rightarrow$ \V$_\text{pl}$ (\NP) (\NP) (\PP)

\begin{itemize}
\item worse when we add person and even worse in languages with richer
  agreement (e.g., three genders).
\item lose generalizations about nouns and verbs --- can't say
  property $P$ is true of all words of category \V.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\subsection{Subcategorization}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Subcategorization}

Verbs have preferences for the kinds of constituents (cf.\ arguments) they co-occur
with.
\begin{itemize}
\item \ling{I found the cat.}
\item \bad \ling{I disappeared the cat.}
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item \ling{It depends} [$_{\PP}$ \ling{on the question}].
\item \bad \ling{It depends}  [$_{\PP}$ \{\ling{to/from/by}\} \ling{the question}].
\end{itemize}


A traditional subcategorization of verbs:
\begin{itemize}
\item transitive (takes a direct object \NP)
\item intransitive
\end{itemize}

In more recent approaches, there might be as many as a hundred
subcategorizations of verb.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Subcategorization, cont.}
More examples:
\begin{itemize}
\item \ling{find} is subcategorized for an \NP\ (can take an \NP\
complement)
\item \ling{want} is subcategorized for an \NP\ or an infinitival \VP
\item \ling{bet} is subcategorized for  \NP\ \NP\ \Se
\end{itemize}

A listing of the possible sequences of complements is called the 
\Em{subcategorization frame} for the verb.

As with agreement, the obvious CFG solution yields rule
explosion:

\VP\ $\rightarrow$ \V$_\text{intr}$

\VP\ $\rightarrow$ \V$_\text{tr}$\ \NP

\VP\ $\rightarrow$ \V$_\text{ditr}$\ \NP\ \NP

%\VP\ $\rightarrow$ \V$_\text{ditrS}$\ \NP\ \NP\ \Se

\section{Summary}

  \frametitle{Summary}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item CFGs capture hierarchical structure of constituents in
          natural language.
        
    \item More powerful than REs, and can express recursive
          structure.

    \item Hard to get a variety of linguistic generalizations in
          'vanilla' CFGs, though this can be mitigated with use of
          features (not covered here).


     \item Building a CFG for a reasonably large set of English
           constructions is a lot of work!

  \end{itemize}
