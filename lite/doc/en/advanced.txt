Introduction
------------

This chapter introduces concepts in algorithms, data structures,
program design, and advanced Python programming.
It contains many working program fragments which you should try yourself.

List Operations
---------------

There are plenty of more sophisticated operations we can perform with
lists and strings, e.g.:

  >>> sent = ['The', 'dog', 'gave', 'John', 'the', 'newspaper']
  >>> map(len, sent)
  [3, 3, 4, 4, 3, 9]


List Comprehensions
-------------------

Many language processing tasks involve applying the same operation to
every item in a list.  Here we lowercase each word:

  >>> [word.lower() for word in sent]
  ['the', 'dog', 'gave', 'john', 'the', 'newspaper']

As another example, we could remove all determiners from a list of
words:

  >>> def is_lexical(word):
  ...     return word.lower() not in ('a', 'an', 'the', 'that', 'to')
  >>> [word for word in sent if is_lexical(word)]
  ['dog', 'gave', 'John', 'newspaper']

Or equivalently:

  >>> filter(is_lexical, sent)
  ['dog', 'gave', 'John', 'newspaper']


Combining the transformations...

  >>> [word.lower() for word in sent if is_lexical(word)]
  ['dog', 'gave', 'john', 'newspaper']


.. Another example: stemming each word:
..   >>> from nltk_lite import tokenize
..   >>> stemmer = tokenize.RegexpStemmer('ing$|s$|e$')

The following code builds a list of tuples, where each tuple consists
of a word and its length.

  >>> [(x, len(x)) for x in sent]
  [('The', 3), ('dog', 3), ('gave', 4), ('John', 4), ('the', 3), ('newspaper', 9)]

Program Development
-------------------

Programming is a skill which is acquired over several years of
experience with a variety of programming languages and tasks.  Key
high-level abilities are *algorithm design* and its manifestation in
*structured programming*.  Key low-level abilities include familiarity
with the syntactic constructs of the language, and knowledge of a
variety of diagnostic methods for trouble-shooting a program which
does not exhibit the expected behaviour.

Defining Functions
------------------

It often happens that part of a program needs to be used several times over.
For example, suppose we were writing a program that needed to be able to form
the plural of a singular noun, and that this needed to be done at various
places during the program.  Rather than repeating the same code several times
over, it is more efficient (and reliable) to localize this work inside a *function*.
A function is a programming construct which takes one or more inputs, and produces
an output.  In this case, we will take the singular noun as input, and generate a
plural form as output:

  >>> def plural(word):
  ...     if word[-1] == 'y':
  ...         return word[:-1] + 'ies'
  ...     elif word[-1] in 'sx':
  ...         return word + 'es'
  ...     elif word[-2:] in ['sh', 'ch']:
  ...         return word + 'es'
  ...     elif word[-2:] == 'an':
  ...         return word[:-2] + 'en'
  ...     return word + 's'
  >>> plural('fairy')
  'fairies'
  >>> plural('woman')
  'women'

Well-structured programs often make extensive use of functions.  Often when a block
of program code grows longer than a screenful, it is a great help to readability if
it is decomposed into one or more functions.

Algorithm Design
----------------

An *algorithm* is a "recipe" for solving a problem.  For example,
to multiply 16 by 12 we might use any of the following methods:

1. Add 16 to itself 12 times over
#. Perform "long multiplication", starting with the least-significant
   digits of both numbers
#. Look up a multiplication table
#. Repeatedly halve the first number and double the second,
   16*12 = 8*24 = 4*48 = 2*96 = 192
#. Do 10*12 to get 120, then add 6*12

Each of these methods is a different algorithm, and requires different
amounts of computation time and different amounts of intermediate
information to store.  A similar situation holds for many other
superficially simple tasks, such as sorting a list of words.  Now, as
we saw above, Python provides a built-in function ``sort()`` that
performs this task efficiently.  However, NLTK-Lite also provides
several algorithms for sorting lists, to illustrate the variety of
possible methods.  To illustrate the difference in efficiency, we
will create a list of 1000 numbers, randomize the list, then sort it,
counting the number of list manipulations required.

  >>> from random import shuffle
  >>> a = range(1000)                     # [0,1,2,...999]
  >>> shuffle(a)                          # randomize

Now we can try a simple sort method called *bubble sort*, which
scans through the list many times, exchanging adjacent items if
they are out of order.  It sorts the list ``a`` in-place, and returns
the number of times it modified the list:

  >>> from nltk_lite.misc import sort
  >>> sort.bubble(a)
  250918

We can try the same task using various sorting algorithms.  Evidently
*merge sort* is much better than bubble sort, and *quicksort* is better still.

  >>> shuffle(a); sort.merge(a)
  6175
  >>> shuffle(a); sort.quick(a)
  2378

Readers are encouraged to look at ``nltk_lite.misc.sort`` to see how
these different methods work.  The collection of NLTK-Lite modules
exemplify a variety of algorithm design techniques, including
brute-force, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy search.
Readers who would like a systematic introduction to algorithm design
should consult the resources mentioned at the end of this tutorial.

Programming Style
-----------------

We have just seen how the same task can be performed in different
ways, with implications for efficiency.  Another factor influencing
program development is *programming style*.  Consider the following
program to compute the average length of words in the Brown Corpus:

  >>> from nltk_lite.corpora import brown
  >>> count = 0
  >>> total = 0
  >>> for sent in brown.raw('a'):
  ...     for token in sent:
  ...         count += 1
  ...         total += len(token)
  >>> print float(total) / count
  4.2765382469

In this program we use the variable ``count`` to keep track of the
number of tokens seen, and ``total`` to store the combined length of
all words.  This is a low-level style, not far removed from machine
code, the primitive operations performed by the computer's CPU.
The two variables are just like a CPU's registers, accumulating values
at many intermediate stages, values which are almost meaningless. 
We say that this program is written in a *procedural* style, dictating
the machine operations step by step.  Now consider the following
program which computes the same thing:

  >>> tokens = [token for sent in brown.raw('a') for token in sent]
  >>> total = sum(map(len, tokens))
  >>> print float(total)/len(tokens)
  4.2765382469

The first line uses a list comprehension to construct the sequence of
tokens.  The second line *maps* the ``len`` function to this sequence,
to create a list of length values, which are summed.  The third line
computes the average as before.  Notice here that each line of code
performs a complete, meaningful action.  Moreover, they do not dictate
how the computer will perform the computations; we state high level
relationships like "``total`` is the sum of the lengths of the tokens"
and leave the details to the Python interpreter.  Accordingly, we say
that this program is written in a *declarative* style.

Here is another example to illustrate the procedural/declarative
distinction.  Notice again that the procedural version
involves low-level steps and a variable having meaningless
intermediate values:

  >>> word_list = []
  >>> for sent in brown.raw('a'):
  ...     for token in sent:
  ...         if token not in word_list:
  ...             word_list.append(token)
  >>> word_list.sort()

The declarative version (given second) makes use of higher-level
built-in functions:

  >>> tokens = [word for sent in brown.raw('a') for word in sent]
  >>> word_list = list(set(tokens))
  >>> word_list.sort()

What do these programs compute?  Which version was easier to
interpret?

Consider one further example, which sorts three-letter words by their
final letters.  The words come from the widely-used Unix word-list,
made available as an NLTK corpus called ``words``.  Two words ending
with the same letter will be sorted according to their second-last
letters.  The result of this sort method is that rhyming words will be
contiguous.  Two programs are given; Which one is more declarative,
and which is more procedural?

As an aside, for readability we define a function for reversing
strings that will be used by both programs:

  >>> def reverse(word):
  ...     return word[::-1]

Here's the first program.  We define a helper function ``reverse_cmp``
which calls the built-in ``cmp`` comparison function on reversed
strings.  The ``cmp`` function returns ``-1``, ``0``, or ``1``,
depending on whether its first argument is less than, equal to, or
greater than its second argument.  We tell the list sort function to
use ``reverse_cmp`` instead of ``cmp`` (the default).

  >>> from nltk_lite.corpora import words
  >>> def reverse_cmp(x,y):
  ...     return cmp(reverse(x), reverse(y))
  >>> word_list = [word for word in words.raw('en') if len(word) == 3]
  >>> word_list.sort(reverse_cmp)
  >>> print word_list[-12:]
  ['toy', 'spy', 'cry', 'dry', 'fry', 'pry', 'try', 'buy', 'guy', 'ivy', 'Paz', 'Liz']

Here's the second program.  In the first loop it collects up all the
three-letter words in reversed form.  Next, it sorts the list of
reversed words.  Then, in the second loop, it iterates over each
position in the list using the variable ``i``, and replaces each item
with its reverse.  We have now re-reversed the words, and can print
them out.

  >>> word_list = []
  >>> for word in words.raw('en'):
  ...     if len(word) == 3:
  ...         word_list.append(reverse(word))
  >>> word_list.sort()
  >>> for i in range(len(word_list)):
  ...     word_list[i] = reverse(word_list[i])
  >>> print word_list[-12:]
  ['toy', 'spy', 'cry', 'dry', 'fry', 'pry', 'try', 'buy', 'guy', 'ivy', 'Paz', 'Liz']

Choosing between procedural and declarative styles is just that, a
question of style.  There are no hard boundaries, and it is possible
to mix the two.  Readers new to programming are encouraged to
experiment with both styles, and to make the extra effort required to
master higher-level constructs, such as list comprehensions, and
built-in functions like ``map``.

Debugging
---------

This task is known as *debugging*, since the problems are usually
small relative to their impact, hard-to-find, and seem to take on a
life of their own as the programmer tries to hunt them down.

The first step is to isolate the problem.  If there was a run-time
error, the Python interpreter will exit, providing a *stack-trace*
which lists the most recently called functions with their line numbers.
The simplest way to deal with such errors is to add print statements
to the program just before the offending line, permitting you to inspect
the values of variables (sometimes they are different to what you expected).

Python also provides an interactive debugger called ``pdb``, which stands
for Python debugger.  If your program is saved in a file ``myscript.py``,
then you can access the debugger with ``python -m pdb myscript.py``.
