Introduction
------------

Parsing allows us to find tree structures representing the internal
organization of a text.  These trees are useful for a wide variety of
tasks, including semantic interpretation, information retrieval, and
machine translation.  Unfortunately, most texts have a large number of
possible structures.  This causes two problems for the symbolic
approaches discussed in the earlier chapter on parsing.

1. **Ambiguity**: There is no way to decide which of the tree
   structures are likely to correctly represent the text's internal
   organization.

2. **Efficiency**: Parsing a text requires searching a very large
   space of possible tree structures.  With no information about which
   subtrees are more likely to be included in a complete parse, it can
   take a long time to find even a single parse.

Probabilistic techniques provide tools to address both of these
problems.  We can assign probabilities to parses, and use them to
decide which structures are more likely to represent a text's internal
organization; and we can use probabilities to guide our search of the
space of possible tree structures.

-----------------------------------
Probabilistic Context Free Grammars
-----------------------------------
 
A *probabilistic context free grammar* (or *PCFG*) is a context free
grammar that associates a probability with each of its productions.
It generates the same set of parses for a text that the corresponding
context free grammar does, and assigns a probability to each parse.
The probability of a parse generated by a PCFG is simply the product
of the probabilities of the productions used to generate it.

Probabilistic context free grammars are implemented by the
``nltk_lite.parse.pcfg.Grammar`` class.  Like CFGs, each PCFG consists
of a start state and a list of productions.  But the productions are
represented by ``pcfg.Production``, a subclass of ``cfg.Production``
that associates a probability with a context free grammar
production.

PCFG Productions
----------------
      
Each PCFG production specifies that a nonterminal (the *left-hand
side*) can be expanded to a sequence of terminals and nonterminals
(the *right-hand side*).  In addition, each production has a
probability associated with it.  Productions are created using the
``nltk_lite.parse.pcfg.Production`` constructor, which takes a
probability, a nonterminal left-hand side, and zero or more terminals
and nonterminals for the right-hand side.

  >>> from nltk_lite.parse import cfg
  >>> S, VP, V, NP = cfg.nonterminals('S, VP, V, NP')

  >>> from nltk_lite.parse import pcfg
  >>> prod1 = pcfg.Production(VP, [V, NP], prob=0.23)
  >>> prod1
  VP -> V NP (p=0.23)

  >>> prod2 = pcfg.Production(V, ['saw'], prob=0.12)
  >>> prod2
  V -> 'saw' (p=0.12)

  >>> prod3 = pcfg.Production(NP, ['cookie'], prob=0.04)
  >>> prod3
  NP -> 'cookie' (p=0.04)

The probability associated with a production is returned by the
``prob`` method:

  >>> print prod1.prob(), prod2.prob(), prod3.prob() 
  0.23 0.12 0.04

As with CFG productions, the left-hand side of a PCFG production is
returned by the ``lhs`` method; and the right-hand side is returned by
the ``rhs`` method:

  >>> prod1.lhs() 
  <VP>
  >>> prod1.rhs() 
  (<V>, <NP>)


PCFGs
-----

PCFGs are created using the ``pcfg.Grammar`` constructor, which takes
a start symbol and a list of productions:

  >>> prods = [pcfg.Production(S, [NP, VP], prob=1.0),
  ...          pcfg.Production(VP, ['saw', NP], prob=0.4),
  ...          pcfg.Production(VP, ['ate'], prob=0.3),
  ...          pcfg.Production(VP, ['gave', NP, NP], prob=0.3),
  ...          pcfg.Production(NP, ['the', 'cookie'], prob=0.8),
  ...          pcfg.Production(NP, ['Jack'], prob=0.2)]

  >>> grammar = pcfg.Grammar(S, prods) 
  >>> print grammar
  Grammar with 6 productions (start state = S)
      S -> NP VP (p=1.0)
      VP -> 'saw' NP (p=0.4)
      VP -> 'ate' (p=0.3)
      VP -> 'gave' NP NP (p=0.3)
      NP -> 'the' 'cookie' (p=0.8)
      NP -> 'Jack' (p=0.2)

In order to ensure that the trees generated by the grammar form a
proper probability distribution, PCFG grammars impose the constraint
that all productions with a given left-hand side must have
probabilities that sum to one:

  for all *lhs*:
    `SIGMA`:subscript:`rhs` P(*lhs* |rarr| *rhs*) = 1

The example grammar given above obeys this constraint: for ``S``,
there is only one production, with a probability of 1.0; for ``VP``,
0.4+0.3+0.3=1.0; and for ``NP``, 0.8+0.2=1.0.

As with CFGs, the start state of a PCFG is returned by the ``start``
method; and the productions are returned by the ``productions``
method:

  >>> grammar.start()
  <S>
  >>> from pprint import pprint
  >>> pprint(grammar.productions())
  (S -> NP VP (p=1.0),
   VP -> 'saw' NP (p=0.4),
   VP -> 'ate' (p=0.3),
   VP -> 'gave' NP NP (p=0.3),
   NP -> 'the' 'cookie' (p=0.8),
   NP -> 'Jack' (p=0.2))

---------------------
Probabilistic Parsers
---------------------

The Probabilistic Parser Interface
----------------------------------

The parse trees returned by ``parse`` and ``get_parse_list`` include
probabilities:

  >>> from nltk_lite.parse import ViterbiParse
  >>> from nltk_lite import tokenize
  >>> viterbi_parser = ViterbiParse(grammar)
  >>> sent = list(tokenize.whitespace('Jack saw the cookie'))
  >>> viterbi_parser.get_parse(sent)
  (S: (NP: 'Jack') (p=0.2) (VP: 'saw' (NP: 'the' 'cookie') (p=0.8)) (p=0.32)) (p=0.064)

  >>> viterbi_parser.get_parse_list(sent)
  [(S: (NP: 'Jack') (p=0.2) (VP: 'saw' (NP: 'the' 'cookie') (p=0.8)) (p=0.32)) (p=0.064)]


Probabilistic Parser Implementations
------------------------------------

The next two sections introduce two probabilistic parsing algorithms
for PCFGs.  The first is a Viterbi-style algorithm that uses dynamic
programming to find the single most likely parse for a given text.
Whenever it finds multiple possible parses for a subtree, it discards
all but the most likely parse.  The second is a bottom-up chart parser
that maintains a queue of edges, and adds them to the chart one at a
time.  The ordering of this queue is based on the probabilities
associated with the edges, allowing the parser to expand more likely
edges before less likely ones.  Different queue orderings are used to
implement a variety of different search strategies.  These algorithms
are implemented in the ``nltk_lite.parse.viterbi`` and
``nltk_lite.parse.pchart`` modules.

A Viterbi-Style PCFG Parser
---------------------------

The ``ViterbiParse`` PCFG parser is a bottom-up parser that uses
dynamic programming to find the single most likely parse for a text.
It parses texts by iteratively filling in a *most likely constituents
table*.  This table records the most likely tree structure for each
span and node value.  In particular, it has an entry for every start
index, end index, and node value, recording the most likely subtree
that spans from the start index to the end index, and has the given
node value.  For example, after parsing the sentence "I saw John with
my cookie" with a simple grammar, the most likely constituents table
might be as follows:

===== ==== ==================================================================  =======
Most Likely Constituents Table
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Span  Node Tree                                                                Prob
===== ==== ==================================================================  =======
[0:1] NP   (NP: I)                                                             0.3
[2:3] NP   (NP: John)                                                          0.3
[4:6] NP   (NP: my cookie)                                                     0.2
[3:6] PP   (PP: with (NP: my cookie))                                          0.1
[2:6] NP   (NP: (NP: John) (PP: with (NP: my cookie)))                         0.01
[1:3] VP   (VP: saw (NP: John)))                                               0.03
[1:6] VP   (VP: saw (NP: (NP: John) (PP: with (NP: my cookie))))               0.001
[0:6] S    (S: (NP: I) (VP: saw (NP: (NP: John) (PP: with (NP: my cookie)))))  0.0001
===== ==== ==================================================================  =======

Once the table has been completely filled in, the parser simply
returns the entry for the most likely constituent that spans the
entire text, and whose node value is the start symbol.  For this
example, it would return the entry with a span of [0:6] and a node
value of "S".

Note that we only record the *most likely* constituent for any given
span and node value.  For example, in the table above, there are
actually two possible constituents that cover the span [1:6] and have
"VP" node values.
    
1. "saw John, who has my cookie":

  (VP: saw
     (NP: (NP: John)
          (PP: with (NP: my cookie))))

.. the above example is nonsense when we use a proper name;
   it only works when we use a common noun,
   e.g. "saw the man with my cookie"


2. "used my cookie to see John":

  (VP: saw
     (NP: John)
     (PP: with (NP: my cookie)))

Since the grammar we are using to parse the text indicates that the
first of these tree structures has a higher probability, the parser
discards the second one.

Filling in the Most Likely Constituents Table
*********************************************

Because the grammar used by ``ViterbiParse`` is a PCFG, the
probability of each constituent can be calculated from the
probabilities of its children.  Since a constituent's children can
never cover a larger span than the constituent itself, each entry of
the most likely constituents table depends only on entries for
constituents with *shorter* spans (or equal spans, in the case of
unary and epsilon productions).

``ViterbiParse`` takes advantage of this fact, and fills in the most
likely constituent table incrementally.  It starts by filling in the
entries for all constituents that span a single element of text.
After it has filled in all the table entries for constituents that
span one element of text, it fills in the entries for constituents
that span two elements of text.  It continues filling in the entries
for constituents spanning larger and larger portions of the text,
until the entire table has been filled.

To find the most likely constituent with a given span and node value,
``ViterbiParse`` considers all productions that could produce that
node value.  For each production, it checks the most likely
constituents table for sequences of children that collectively cover
the span and that have the node values specified by the production's
right hand side.  If the tree formed by applying the production to the
children has a higher probability than the current table entry, then
it updates the most likely constituents table with the new tree.

Handling Unary Productions and Epsilon Productions
**************************************************

A minor difficulty is introduced by unary productions and epsilon
productions: an entry of the most likely constituents table might
depend on another entry with the same span.  For example, if the
grammar contains the production ``V`` |rarr| ``VP``, then the table
entries for ``VP`` depend on the entries for ``V`` with the same span.
This can be a problem if the constituents are checked in the wrong
order.  For example, if the parser tries to find the most likely
constituent for a ``VP`` spanning [1:3] before it finds the most
likely constituents for ``V`` spanning [1:3], then it can't apply the
``V`` |rarr| ``VP`` production.
      
To solve this problem, ``ViterbiParse`` repeatedly checks each span
until it finds no new table entries.  Note that cyclic grammar
productions (e.g. ``V`` |rarr| ``V``) will *not* cause this procedure
to enter an infinite loop.  Since all production probabilities are
less than or equal to 1, any constituent generated by a cycle in the
grammar will have a probability that is less than or equal to the
original constituent; so ``ViterbiParse`` will discard it.

Using ``ViterbiParse``
----------------------

Viterbi parsers are created using the ``ViterbiParse`` constructor:

  >>> from nltk_lite.parse.viterbi import *
  >>> ViterbiParse(grammar)
  <ViterbiParser for <Grammar with 6 productions>>

Note that since ``ViterbiParse`` only finds the single most likely
parse, that ``get_parse_list`` will never return more than one parse.

  >>> viterbi_parser1 = ViterbiParse(pcfg.toy1)
  >>> sent1 = list(tokenize.whitespace('I saw John with my cookie'))
  >>> tree1 = viterbi_parser1.parse(sent1)
  >>> print tree1
  (S:
    (NP: 'I')
    (VP:
      (V: 'saw')
      (NP:
        (NP: 'John')
        (PP: (P: 'with') (NP: (Det: 'my') (N: 'cookie')))))) (p=5.2040625e-05)

      
  >>> viterbi_parser2 = ViterbiParse(pcfg.toy2)
  >>> sent2 = list(tokenize.whitespace('the boy saw Jack with Bob under the table with a telescope'))
  >>> trees = viterbi_parser2.get_parse_list(sent2)
  >>> for tree in trees:
  ...     print tree
  (S:
    (NP: (Det: 'the') (N: 'boy'))
    (VP:
      (V: 'saw')
      (NP:
        (NP: (Name: 'Jack'))
        (PP:
          (P: 'with')
          (NP:
            (NP:
              (NP: (Name: 'Bob'))
              (PP:
                (P: 'under')
                (NP: (Det: 'the') (N: 'table'))))
            (PP:
              (P: 'with')
              (NP: (Det: 'a') (N: 'telescope')))))))) (p=7.53678903935e-11)

The ``trace`` method can be used to set the level of tracing output
that is generated when parsing a text.  Trace output displays the
constituents that are considered, and indicates which ones are added
to the most likely constituent table.  It also indicates the
likelihood for each constituent.

  >>> viterbi_parser1.trace(3)
  >>> tree = viterbi_parser1.parse(sent1)

The level of tracing output can also be set with an optional argument to
the ``ViterbiParse`` constructor.  By default, no tracing output is generated.
Tracing output can be turned off by calling ``trace`` with a value of ``0``.

A Bottom-Up PCFG Chart Parser
-----------------------------

Introduction
------------

The Viterbi-style algorithm described in the previous section finds
the single most likely parse for a given text.  But for many
applications, it is useful to produce several alternative parses.
This is often the case when probabilistic parsers are combined with
other probabilistic systems.  In particular, the most probable parse
may be assigned a low probability by other systems; and a parse that
is given a low probability by the parser might have a better overall
probability.

For example, a probabilistic parser might decide that the most likely
parse for "I saw John with the cookie" is is the structure with the
interpretation "I used my cookie to see John"; but that parse would be
assigned a low probability by a semantic system.  Combining the
probability estimates from the parser and the semantic system, the
parse with the interpretation "I saw John, who had my cookie" would be
given a higher overall probability.

This section describes ``BottomUpChartParser``, a parser for PCFGs
that can find multiple parses for a text.  It assumes that you have
already read the chart parsing tutorial, and are familiar with the
data structures and productions used for chart parsing.

The Basic Algorithm
-------------------

``BottomUpChartParser`` is a bottom-up parser for PCFGs that uses
a ``Chart`` to record partial results.  It maintains a queue of
edges, and adds them to the chart one at a time.  The ordering
of this queue is based on the probabilities associated with the edges,
allowing the parser to insert more likely edges before exploring less
likely ones.  For each edge that the parser adds to the chart, it may
become possible to insert new edges into the chart; these are added to
the queue.  ``BottomUpChartParser`` continues adding the edges in the
queue to the chart until enough complete parses have been found, or
until the edge queue is empty.

Probabilistic Edges
-------------------

An ``Edge`` associates a dotted production and a location with a
(partial) parse tree.  A *probabilistic edge* can be formed by using a
``ProbabilisticTree`` to encode an edge's parse tree.  The probability
of this tree is the product of the probability of the production that
generated it and the probabilities of its children.  For example, the
probability associated with an edge ``[Edge: S`` |rarr| ``NP`` |dot|
``VP]@[0:2]`` is the probability of its NP child times the probability
of the PCFG production ``S`` |rarr| ``NP VP``.  Note that an edge's
tree only includes children for elements to the left of the
edge's dot.  Thus, the edge's probability does *not* include any
probabilities for the elements to the right of the edge's dot.

The Edge Queue
--------------

The edge queue is a sorted list of edges that can be added to the
chart.  It is initialized with a single edge for each token in the
text.  These *token edges* have the form [Edge: token |rarr| |dot|]
where *token* is the word.

As each edge from the queue is added to the chart, it may become
possible to insert new edges into the chart; these new edges are added
to the queue.  There are two ways that it can become possible to
insert new edges into the chart:

1. The *bottom-up initialization production* can be used to add a self-loop edge
   whenever an edge whose dot is in position 0 is added to the chart.

2. The *fundamental production* can be used to combine a new edge with edges already
   present in the chart.

The edge queue is implemented using a ``list``.  For efficiency
reasons, ``BottomUpChartParser`` uses ``pop`` to remove edges from the
queue.  Thus, the front of the queue is the *end* of the list.  This
needs to be kept in mind when implementing sorting orders for the
queue: edges that should be tried first should be placed at the end of
the list.

Sorting The Edge Queue
----------------------

By changing the sorting order used by the queue, we can control the
strategy that the parser uses to search for parses of a text.  Since
there are a wide variety of reasonable search strategies,
``BottomUpChartParser`` does not define the sorting order for the
queue.  Instead, ``BottomUpPCFGChartParser`` is defined as an abstract
class; and subclasses are used to implement a variety of different
queue orderings.  Each subclass is required to define the
``sort_queue`` method, which sorts a given queue.  The remainder of
this section describes four different subclasses of
``BottomUpChartParser`` that are defined in the
``nltk_lite.parse.pchart`` module.

InsideParse
***********

.. We should either explain "inside probabilities" or rename this parser (to
        ``LowestCostFirstParser``?). 

The simplest way to order the queue is to sort the edges by the
probabilities of their trees.  This ordering concentrates the
efforts of the parser on edges that are more likely to be correct
descriptions of the texts that they span.  This approach is
implemented by the ``InsideParse`` class.

The probability of an edge's tree provides an upper bound on the
probability of any parse produced using that edge.  The probabilistic
"cost" of using an edge to form a parse is one minus its tree's
probability.  Thus, inserting the edges with the most likely trees
first results in a *lowest-cost-first* search strategy.
Lowest-cost-first search is an *optimal* search strategy: the first
solution it finds is guaranteed to be the best solution.

However, lowest-cost-first search can be rather inefficient.  Since a
tree's probability is the product of the probabilities of all the
productions used to generate it, smaller trees tend to have higher
probabilities than larger ones.  Thus, lowest-cost-first search tends
to insert edges with small trees before moving on to edges with larger
ones.  But any complete parse of the text will necessarily have a
large tree; so complete parses will tend to be inserted after nearly
all other edges.

The basic problem with lowest-cost-first search is that it ignores the
probability that an edge's tree is part of a complete parse.  It will
try parses that are locally coherent, even if they are unlikely to
form part of a complete parse.  Unfortunately, it can be quite
difficult to calculate the probability that a tree is part of a
complete parse.  However, we can use a variety of techniques to
approximate that probability.

Since ``InsideParse`` is a subclass of ``BottomUpChartParse``, it only
needs to define a ``sort_queue`` method.  Thus, the implementation of
``InsideParse`` class is quite simple::

  class InsideParse(BottomUpChartParse):
    def sort_queue(self, queue, chart):
      # Sort the edges by the probabilities of their trees.
      queue.sort(lambda e1,e2:cmp(e1.tree().prob(), e2.tree().prob()))

LongestParse
************

``LongestParse`` sorts its queue in descending order of the edges'
lengths.  These lengths (properly normalized) provide a crude
approximations to the probabilities that trees are part of complete
parses.  Thus, ``LongestParse`` employs a *best-first* search
strategy, where it inserts the edges that are closest to producing
complete parses before trying any other edges.  Best-first search is
*not* an optimal search strategy: the first solution it finds is not
guaranteed to be the best solution.  However, it will usually find a
complete parse much more quickly than lowest-cost-first search.

Since ``LongestParse`` is a subclass of ``BottomUpChartParse``, its implementation
simply defines a ``sort_queue`` method::

  class LongestParse(BottomUpChartParse):
    def sort_queue(self, queue, chart):
      # Sort the edges by the lengths of their trees.
      queue.sort(lambda e1,e2: cmp(len(e1.loc()), len(e2.loc())))

BeamParse
*********

When large grammars are used to parse a text, the edge queue can grow
quite long.  The edges at the end of a large well-sorted queue are
unlikely to be used.  Therefore, it is reasonable to remove (or
*prune*) these edges from the queue.

``BeamParse`` provides a simple implementation of a pruning PCFG
parser.  It uses the same sorting order as ``InsideParse``.  But
whenever the edge queue grows beyond a pre-defined maximum length,
``BeamParse`` truncates it.  The resulting search strategy,
lowest-cost-first search with pruning, is a type of beam search.  (A
*beam search* is a search strategy that only keeps the best partial
results.)  The queue's predefined maximum length is called the *beam
size* (or simply the *beam*).  The parser's beam size is set by the
first argument to its constructor.

Beam search reduces the space requirements for lowest-cost-first
search, by discarding edges that are not likely to be used.  But beam
search also loses many of lowest-cost-first search's more useful
properties.  Beam search is not optimal: it is not guaranteed to find
the best parse first.  In fact, since it might prune a necessary edge,
beam search is not even *complete*: it is not guaranteed to return a
parse if one exists.

The implementation for ``BeamParse`` defines two methods.  First, it
overrides the constructor, since it needs to record the beam size.
And second, it defines the ``sort_queue`` method, which sorts the
queue and discards any excess edges::
        
  class BeamParse(BottomUpChartParse):
    def __init__(self, beam_size, grammar, trace=0):
      BottomUpChartParse.__init__(self, grammar, trace)
      self._beam_size = beam_size

    def sort_queue(self, queue, chart):
      # Sort the queue.
      queue.sort(lambda e1,e2:cmp(e1.tree().prob(), e2.tree().prob()))
      # Truncate the queue, if necessary.
      if len(queue) > self._beam_size:
        queue[:] = queue[len(queue)-self._beam_size:]

Note that when truncating the queue, ``sort_queue`` uses the
expression ``queue[:]`` to change the *contents* of the ``queue``
variable.  In particular, compare it to the following code, which
reassigns the local variable ``queue``, but does not modify the
contents of the given list::

  # WRONG: This does not change the contents of the edge queue. 
  if len(queue) > self._beam_size:
    queue = queue[len(queue) - self._beam_size:]

  # WRONG: The sort method returns None.
  return queue.sort(lambda e1,e2:cmp(e1.tree().prob(), e2.tree().prob()))

      
.. We plan to add an inside/outside parser; when we
   do, we'll add a description of it to this section. 

Using ``BottomUpChartParser``
-----------------------------

These parsers are created using the ``BottomUpChartParse``
subclasses's constructors.  These include: ``InsideParse``,
``LongestParse``, ``BeamParser``, and ``RandomParse``.

See the reference documentation for the ``BottomUpChartParse`` module
for a complete list of subclasses.  Unless a subclass overrides the
constructor, it takes a single PCFG:

  >>> from nltk_lite.parse.pchart import *
  >>> inside_parser = InsideParse(pcfg.toy1)
  >>> longest_parser = LongestParse(pcfg.toy1)
  >>> beam_parser = BeamParse(20, pcfg.toy1)

  >>> print inside_parser.parse(sent1)
  (S:
    (NP: 'I')
    (VP:
      (V: 'saw')
      (NP:
        (NP: 'John')
        (PP: (P: 'with') (NP: (Det: 'my') (N: 'cookie')))))) (p=5.2040625e-05)
      
  >>> for tree in inside_parser.get_parse_list(sent1):
  ...     print tree
  (S:
    (NP: 'I')
    (VP:
      (V: 'saw')
      (NP:
        (NP: 'John')
        (PP: (P: 'with') (NP: (Det: 'my') (N: 'cookie')))))) (p=5.2040625e-05)
  (S:
    (NP: 'I')
    (VP:
      (VP: (V: 'saw') (NP: 'John'))
      (PP: (P: 'with') (NP: (Det: 'my') (N: 'cookie'))))) (p=2.081625e-05)

.. Warning:: ``BottomUpChartParse`` is an abstract class; you should not directly
   instantiate it.  If you try to use it to parse a text, it will raise an exception,
   since ``sort_queue`` will be undefined.

The ``trace`` method can be used to set the level of tracing output
that is generated when parsing a text.  Trace output displays edges as
they are added to the chart, and shows the probability for each edges'
tree.
