Introduction
------------

This tutorial provides a non-technical overview of Python.  It
contains many working program fragments which you should try yourself.
For a more detailed overview, we recommend that you consult one of the
introductions listed in the further reading section below.

----------------------------
Processing lists and strings
----------------------------

In writing Python programs for natural language processing we make
heavy use of lists.  A list is simply an ordered sequence of items.
Each item could be a string, a number, or some more complex object
such as a list.  A Python list is represented as comma-separated
items, enclosed inside brackets, e.g. ``['John', 14, 'Sep', 1984]`` is
a list consisting of four elements.  We initialize a list by giving a
variable name, followed by the equals sign, followed by this square
bracket notation, e.g.:

  >>> a = ['colourless', 'green', 'ideas']

This command sets the value of variable ``a``.  To see the value of
this variable, we can give the command ``print a``.  In interactive
mode, we can just type the variable name:

  >>> a
  ['colourless', 'green', 'ideas']

To find out the length of a list, we can use the ``len()`` function,
which takes the list variable as its argument:

  >>> len(a)
  3

We can access the items of a list individually by using indexes.  Note
that list items are counted starting from zero.

  >>> a[0]
  'colourless'
  >>> a[1]
  'green'

We can also index from the *end* of the list, using negative numbers.
Thus, index ``-1`` returns the last item:

  >>> a[-1]
  'ideas'

Sometimes we mistakenly try to access an index position which does not exist.
If so, Python reports an error:

  >>> a[5]
  IndexError: list index out of range

It is often useful to access multiple items in a list.  In Python this is done using
a special construct called the *slice*.  In general, if ``a`` is a list, then
``a[m:n]`` is the slice starting at item ``m``, and going up to (but not including)
item ``n``.

  >>> a[1:3]
  ['green', 'ideas']

If we leave out the first number, it is assumed to be zero, the start of the list.
So ``a[:n]`` finds everything up to (but not including) item ``n``.
Similarly, ``a[m:]`` finds everything from item ``m`` to the end:

  >>> a[1:]
  ['green', 'ideas']
  >>> a[:2]
  ['colourless', 'green']

Lists can be concatenated, sorted and reversed, as we se below:

  >>> b = a + ['sleep', 'furiously']
  >>> print b
  ['colourless', 'green', 'ideas', 'sleep', 'furiously']
  >>> b.sort()
  >>> print b
  ['colourless', 'furiously', 'green', 'ideas', 'sleep']
  >>> b.reverse()
  >>> print b
  ['sleep', 'ideas', 'green', 'furiously', 'colourless']

.. Note:: If we access individual elements of the above list (which
   are strings), then concatenating them has a different result:

   >>> b[2] + b[1]
   'greenideas'

   This happens because ``b[2]`` is not a list, but an *element* of a list,
   in this case, a string.  Here is another example:

   >>> c = [1,2,3,4,5]
   >>> c[2] + c[1]
   5

   Thus, the behaviour of this ``+`` operator depends on the types of
   its arguments.

We can use the ``for item in list`` syntax to *iterate* over the items of
a list.  In the following fragment we iterate over each word in the above
``b`` list, and print the first character of each word:

  >>> for w in b:
  ...    print w[0]
  ...
  s
  i
  g
  f
  c

Observe that we used the bracket notation to access characters in
a string, just as we earlier used the notation to access items in a
list.  We can combine these two kinds of access, e.g. to find the
third word (at index 2), and print the second character (at index 1):

  >>> b[2]
  'green'
  >>> b[2][1]
  'r'

So far we have accessed items in a list by giving their index.  We
can also access them in terms of their content.  The ``index()``
function returns the first index where the specified item was found:

  >>> b.index('green')
  2

We have already seen the string concatenation operator, ``+``.
We can multiply strings:

  >>> 'sleep' * 3
  'sleepsleepsleep'

We can also join and split strings:

  >>> c = ' '.join(b)
  >>> c
  'sleep ideas green furiously colourless'
  >>> c.split('r')
  ['sleep ideas g', 'een fu', 'iously colou', 'less']

There are plenty of more sophisticated operations we can perform with
lists and strings, e.g.:

  >>> map(lambda x: len(x), b)
  [5, 5, 5, 9, 10]
  >>> [(x, len(x)) for x in b]
  [('sleep', 5), ('ideas', 5), ('green', 5), ('furiously', 9), ('colourless', 10)]

More information on lists and strings can be found by
typing ``help(list)`` and ``help(str)`` at the command prompt.
To find out about individual functions, you can type, e.g.
``help(list.append)``.

----------------------
Dictionaries in Python
----------------------

Lists and strings are accessed by indexes.  This turns out to be too
limiting for many applications.  Instead, we would like to access items
by their names.  For instance, we access a printed dictionary by looking
up an entry by its headword, not by its number.  Python provides a
*dictionary* data type.  We access it using the familiar bracket notation.
Here we declare that ``d`` is a dictionary, then add three entries to it:

  >>> d = {}
  >>> d['colourless'] = 'adj'
  >>> d['furiously'] = 'adv'
  >>> d['ideas'] = 'n'

The *keys* of the dictionary are just the "headwords".  However, they are
not in any predefined order.

  >>> d.keys()
  ['furiously', 'colourless', 'ideas']
  >>> d['ideas']
  'n'

We can iterate over the items in a dictionary using the
``for entry in dict`` syntax, as illustrated below:

  >>> for w in d:
  ...    print "%s [%s]," % (w, d[w]),
  furiously [adv], colourless [adj], ideas [n],

We can print an entire dictionary just by typing its name at the interactive
command prompt:

  >>> d
  {'furiously': 'adv', 'colourless': 'adj', 'ideas': 'n'}

If we try to access a non-existent entry, e.g. by typing
``d['sleep']``, the Python interpreter will report an error.
Two other functions are useful when we don't know if an
entry exists, ``has_key()``, and ``get()``, as illustrated below:

  >>> print d.has_key('ideas')
  True
  >>> print d.get('sleep')
  None

As a simple rule of thumb, dictionary entries are like variable names.
We can *create* them simply by assigning to them, e.g.
``x = 2`` (variable), ``d['x'] = 2`` (dictionary entry).
We can *access* them by reference, e.g.
``print x`` (variable), ``print d['x']`` (dictionary entry).

We can use dictionaries to count word occurrences.  For example, the
following code reads *Macbeth* and counts the frequency of each word::

  >>> from nltk_lite.corpora import gutenberg
  >>> count = {}                                        # initialize a dictionary
  >>> for word in gutenberg.raw('shakespeare-macbeth'): # tokenize Macbeth
  ...     word = word.lower()                           # normalize to lowercase
  ...     if word not in count:                         # seen this word before?
  ...         count[word] = 0                           # if not, set count to zero
  ...     count[word] += 1

Now we can inspect the dictionary::

  >>> print count['scotland']
  12
  >>> frequencies = [(freq, word) for (word, freq) in count.items()]
  >>> frequencies.sort()
  >>> frequencies.reverse()
  >>> print frequencies[:20]
  [(1986, ','), (1245, '.'), (692, 'the'), (654, "'"), (567, 'and'), (482, ':'), (399, 'to'), (365, 'of'), (360, 'i'), (255, 'a'), (246, 'that'), (242, '?'), (224, 'd'), (218, 'you'), (213, 'in'), (207, 'my'), (198, 'is'), (170, 'not'), (165, 'it'), (156, 'with')]

-------------------
Regular Expressions
-------------------

Finally, we look at Python's regular expression module ``re``, for
substituting and searching within strings.

  >>> import re
  >>> from nltk_lite.utilities import re_show
  >>> s = "colourless green ideas sleep furiously"

We use a utility function ``re_show`` to show how regular expressions
match against substrings.  First we search for all instances of a particular
character or character sequence:

  >>> re_show('l', s)
  co{l}our{l}ess green ideas s{l}eep furious{l}y
  >>> re_show('green', s)
  colourless {green} ideas sleep furiously

Now we can perform substitutions.  In the first instance we replace
all instances of ``l`` with ``s``.  Note that this generates a string
as output, and doesn't modify the original string.  Then we replace
any instances of ``green`` with ``red``.

  >>> re.sub('l', 's', s)
  'cosoursess green ideas sseep furioussy'
  >>> re.sub('green', 'red', s)
  'colourless red ideas sleep furiously'

So far we have only seen simple patterns, consisting of individual
characters or sequences of characters.  However, regular expressions can
also contain special syntax, such as ``|`` for disjunction, e.g.:

  >>> re_show('(green|sleep)', s)
  colourless {green} ideas {sleep} furiously
  >>> re.findall('(green|sleep)', s)
  ['green', 'sleep']

We can also disjoin individual characters.  For example,
``[aeiou]`` matches any of ``a``, ``e``, ``i``, ``o``, or ``u``,
that is, any vowel.  The expression ``[^aeiou]`` matches anything
that is not a vowel.  In the following example, we match sequences
consisting of non-vowels followed by vowels.

  >>> re_show('[^aeiou][aeiou]', s)
  {co}{lo}ur{le}ss g{re}en{ i}{de}as s{le}ep {fu}{ri}ously
  >>> re.findall('[^aeiou][aeiou]', s)
  ['co', 'lo', 'le', 're', ' i', 'de', 'le', 'fu', 'ri']

We can put parentheses around parts of an expression in order to
generate structured results.  For example, here we see all those
non-vowel characters which appear before a vowel:

  >>> re.findall('([^aeiou])[aeiou]', s)
  ['c', 'l', 'l', 'r', ' ', 'd', 'l', 'f', 'r']

We can even generate pairs (or *tuples*), which we may then go
on and tabulate.

  >>> re.findall('([^aeiou])([aeiou])', s)
  [('c', 'o'), ('l', 'o'), ('l', 'e'), ('r', 'e'), (' ', 'i'), ('d', 'e'), ('l', 'e'), ('f', 'u'), ('r', 'i')]

---------------------------
Accessing Files and the Web
---------------------------

It is easy to access local files, and web-pages in Python.  Here are some
examples:

  >>> print open('corpus.txt').read() 
  Hello world.  This is a test file.

  >>> from urllib import urlopen
  >>> page = urlopen("http://news.bbc.co.uk/").read()
  >>> page = re.sub('<[^>]*>', '', page)   # strip HTML markup
  >>> page = re.sub('\s+', ' ', page)      # strip whitespace
  >>> print page

--------------
Accessing NLTK
--------------

NLTK consists of a set of Python *modules*, each of which defines
classes and functions related to a single data structure or task.
Before you can use a module, you must ``import`` its contents.  The
simplest way to import the contents of a module is to use the ``from
module import *`` command.  For example, to import the contents of the
``nltk_lite.util`` module, which is discussed in this tutorial, type:

  >>> from nltk_lite.utilities import *

A disadvantage of this style of import statement is that it does not
specify what objects are imported; and it is possible that some of the
import objects will unintentionally cause conflicts.  To avoid this
disadvantage, you can explicitly list the objects you wish to import.
For example, to import the ``re_show`` function from the
``nltk_lite.util`` module, type::

  >>> from nltk_lite.utilities import re_show

Another option is to import the module itself, rather than
its contents.  Now its contents can then be accessed
using *fully qualified* dotted names:

  >>> from nltk_lite import utilities
  >>> utilities.re_show('green', s)
  colourless {green} ideas sleep furiously

For more information about importing, see any Python textbook.

NLTK is distributed with several corpora, listed in the introduction.
Many of these corpora are supported by the NLTK ``corpora`` module.
First we import the Gutenberg corpus (a selection of texts from
the Project Gutenberg electronic text archive).

  >>> from nltk_lite.corpora import gutenberg
  >>> gutenberg.items
  ['austen-emma', 'austen-persuasion', 'austen-sense', 'bible-kjv', 'blake-poems', 'blake-songs', 'chesterton-ball', 'chesterton-brown', 'chesterton-thursday', 'milton-paradise', 'shakespeare-caesar', 'shakespeare-hamlet', 'shakespeare-macbeth', 'whitman-leaves']

We access the text content using a special Python construct called an
*iterator*.  It produces a stream of words, which we can access using
the syntax ``for item in iterator``, as shown below:

  >>> count = 0
  >>> for word in gutenberg.raw('whitman-leaves'):
  ...     count += 1
  >>> print count
  154873

NLTK-Lite also includes the Brown Corpus, the first million word,
part-of-speech tagged electronic corpus of English, created in 1961 at
Brown University.  Each of the sections ``a`` through ``r`` represents
a different genre.

  >>> from nltk_lite.corpora import brown
  >>> brown.items
  ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'p', 'r']

We can extract individual sentences from the corpus iterator using the
``extract()`` function:

  >>> from nltk_lite.corpora import extract
  >>> print extract(0, brown.raw())
  ['The', 'Fulton', 'County', 'Grand', 'Jury', 'said', 'Friday', 'an', 'investigation', 'of', "Atlanta's", 'recent', 'primary', 'election', 'produced', '``', 'no', 'evidence', "''", 'that', 'any', 'irregularities', 'took', 'place', '.']

We can also access the tagged text using the ``brown.tagged()`` method:

  >>> print extract(0, brown.tagged())
  [('The', 'at'), ('Fulton', 'np-tl'), ('County', 'nn-tl'), ('Grand', 'jj-tl'), ('Jury', 'nn-tl'), ('said', 'vbd'), ('Friday', 'nr'), ('an', 'at'), ('investigation', 'nn'), ('of', 'in'), ("Atlanta's", 'np$'), ('recent', 'jj'), ('primary', 'nn'), ('election', 'nn'), ('produced', 'vbd'), ('``', '``'), ('no', 'at'), ('evidence', 'nn'), ("''", "''"), ('that', 'cs'), ('any', 'dti'), ('irregularities', 'nns'), ('took', 'vbd'), ('place', 'nn'), ('.', '.')]

NLTK-Lite includes a 5% fragment of the Penn Treebank.  This can be accessed using
``treebank.raw()`` for the raw text, and ``treebank.tagged()`` for the tagged text.

  >>> from nltk_lite.corpora import treebank
  >>> print extract(0, treebank.parsed())
  (S:
    (NP-SBJ:
      (NP: (NNP: 'Pierre') (NNP: 'Vinken'))
      (,: ',')
      (ADJP: (NP: (CD: '61') (NNS: 'years')) (JJ: 'old'))
      (,: ','))
    (VP:
      (MD: 'will')
      (VP:
        (VB: 'join')
        (NP: (DT: 'the') (NN: 'board'))
        (PP-CLR:
          (IN: 'as')
          (NP: (DT: 'a') (JJ: 'nonexecutive') (NN: 'director')))
        (NP-TMP: (NNP: 'Nov.') (CD: '29'))))
    (.: '.'))


-------------------
Program Development
-------------------

Programming is a skill which is acquired over several years of
experience with a variety of programming languages and tasks.  Key
high-level abilities are *algorithm design* and its manifestation in
*structured programming*.  Key low-level abilities include familiarity
with the syntactic constructs of the language, and knowledge of a
variety of diagnostic methods for trouble-shooting a program which
does not exhibit the expected behaviour.

Algorithm Design
----------------

An *algorithm* is a "recipe" for solving a problem.  For example,
to multiply 16 by 12 we might use any of the following methods:

1. Add 16 to itself 12 times over
#. Perform "long multiplication", starting with the least-significant
   digits of both numbers
#. Look up a multiplication table
#. Repeatedly halve the first number and double the second,
   16*12 = 8*24 = 4*48 = 2*96 = 192
#. Do 10*12 to get 120, then add 6*12

Each of these methods is a different algorithm, and requires different
amounts of computation time and different amounts of intermediate
information to store.  A similar situation holds for many other
superficially simple tasks, such as sorting a list of words.  Now, as
we saw above, Python provides a built-in function ``sort()`` that
performs this task efficiently.  However, NLTK-Lite also provides
several algorithms for sorting lists, to illustrate the variety of
possible methods.  To illustrate the difference in efficiency, we
will create a list of 1000 numbers, randomize the list, then sort it,
counting the number of list manipulations required.

  >>> from random import shuffle
  >>> a = range(1000)                     # [0,1,2,...999]
  >>> shuffle(a)                          # randomize

Now we can try a simple sort method called *bubble sort*, which
scans through the list many times, exchanging adjacent items if
they are out of order.  It sorts the list ``a`` in-place, and returns
the number of times it modified the list:

  >>> from nltk_lite.misc import sort
  >>> sort.bubble(a)
  250918

We can try the same task using various sorting algorithms.  Evidently
*merge sort* is much better than bubble sort, and *quicksort* is better still.

  >>> shuffle(a); sort.merge(a)
  6175
  >>> shuffle(a); sort.quick(a)
  2378

Readers are encouraged to look at ``nltk_lite.misc.sort`` to see how
these different methods work.  The collection of NLTK-Lite modules
exemplify a variety of algorithm design techniques, including
brute-force, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy search.
Readers who would like a systematic introduction to algorithm design
should consult the resources mentioned at the end of this tutorial.

Debugging
---------

This task is known as *debugging*, since the problems are usually
small relative to their impact, hard-to-find, and seem to take on a
life of their own as the programmer tries to hunt them down.

The first step is to isolate the problem.  If there was a run-time
error, the Python interpreter will exit, providing a *stack-trace*
which lists the most recently called functions with their line numbers.
The simplest way to deal with such errors is to add print statements
to the program just before the offending line, permitting you to inspect
the values of variables (sometimes they are different to what you expected).

Python also provides an interactive debugger called ``pdb``, which stands
for Python debugger.  If your program is saved in a file ``myscript.py``,
then you can access the debugger with ``python -m pdb myscript.py``.

---------------
NLTK Interfaces
---------------

``TokenizerI`` is the first "interface" class we've encountered; at
this point, we'll take a short digression to explain how interfaces
are implemented in NLTK.

An *interface* gives a partial specification of the behavior of a
class, including specifications for methods that the class should
implement.  For example, a "comparable" interface might specify that a
class must implement a comparison method.  Interfaces do not give a
complete specification of a class; they only specify a minimum set of
methods and behaviors which should be implemented by the class.  For
example, the ``TaggerI`` interface specifies that a tagger class must
implement a ``tag`` method, which takes a ``string``, and returns a
tuple, consisting of that string and its part-of-speech tag; but it
does not specify what other methods the class should implement (if
any).

.. note:: The notion of "interfaces" can be very useful in ensuring that
   different classes work together correctly.  Although the concept of
   "interfaces" is supported in many languages, such as Java, there is no
   native support for interfaces in Python.

NLTK therefore implements interfaces using classes, all of whose
methods raise the ``NotImplementedError`` exception.  To distinguish
interfaces from other classes, they are always named with a trailing
``I``.  If a class implements an interface, then it should be a
subclass of the interface.  For example, the ``Ngram`` tagger class
implements the ``TaggerI`` interface, and so it is a subclass of
``TaggerI``.

Exercises
---------

Using the Python interpreter in interactive mode, experiment with
words, texts, tokens, locations and tokenizers, and satisfy yourself
that you understand all the examples in the tutorial.  Now complete
the following questions.

1. Using the Python interpreter in interactive mode, experiment with
   the examples contained in this tutorial.  Think of a sentence and
   represent it as a list of strings, e.g. ['Hello', 'world'].
   Try the various operations for indexing, slicing and sorting the elements
   of your list.  Extract individual items (strings), and perform
   some of the string operations on them.

2. Create a dictionary ``d``, and add some entries.  What happens if
   you try to access a non-existent entry, e.g. ``d['xyz']``?

3. Define a string ``s = 'colourless'``.  Write a Python statement
   that changes this to 'colorless', using only the slice and
   concatenation operations.

4. Describe the class of strings matched by the following regular
   expressions:

   a) ``[a-zA-Z]+``
   #) ``[A-Z][a-z]*``
   #) ``\d+(\.\d+)?``
   #) ``([bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz][aeiou][bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz])*``
   #) ``\w+|[^\w\s]+``

5. Write regular expressions to match the following classes of strings:

  a) A single determiner (assume that *a*, *an*, and *the*
     are the only determiners).
  #) An arithmetic expression using integers, addition, and
     multiplication, such as ``2*3+8``.

6. Use the corpus module to tokenize ``austin-persuasion.txt``.
   How many words does this book have?

7. Try running the Eliza chat-bot.  Import it with
   ``from nltk_lite.chat import eliza``, then run the demonstration,
   ``demo()``.  How *intelligent* is this program?
   Take a look at the program code and see if you can
   discover how it works.
