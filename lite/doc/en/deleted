    [What is the relationship between linguistics and NLP?
    Goal of (generative) linguistics to account for the grammaticality
    judgements of the ideal monolingual speaker/hearer, vs goal of
    NLP to build systems to map between the (linguistic) systems of
    humans and machines.  Challenge of linguistics is to balance
    descriptive and explanatory adequacy; challenge of NLP to balance
    expressiveness and tractability.]

    In the late 1980s and early 1990s there was a promising
    convergence between the fields of linguistics and NLP.  (This had
    been a feature of the 1960s, e.g. with the application of the SPE
    model in speech synthesis systems.)  Computational linguists often
    looked to linguistics as a source of knowledge about language.
    Over the last decade we have seen a new divergence, as
    computational linguists have discovered that linguistic analyses
    often failed to account for the linguistic patterns attested in
    the large corpora used to develop their systems.  However, once
    linguists learn to work with these large datasets, their own
    analytical work will benefit, leading to broader coverage of their
    theories, and earlier refutation of false hypotheses.  The result,
    we expect, will be new opportunities for cross-fertilization
    between linguistics and NLP.

    In the following sections, we will give a more detailed account of
    the linguistic and practical issues that arise in the course of
    part-of-speech tagging, and then survey how tagging is carried out
    in NLTK. Before launching into this, however, we will give the
    reader a flavour of the uses of tagging. That is,
    we consider three kinds of language analysis where tags play
    an important role: parsing, morphological analysis, and
    stylistics.
  </para>

  <para>
    Most natural language parsers depend on <glossterm>part-of-speech
    tags</glossterm>.  Instead of writing rules like ``NP &rarr;
    the dog`` and ``NP &rarr; three red cars``,
    we can write ``NP &rarr; DT JJ* NN``.  In this way,
    the terminal symbols of the grammar can be word categories, instead
    of words, greatly reducing the size of the grammar.

  </para>



  <para>
    <glossterm>Morphological analysis</glossterm> is also assisted by part-of-speech tags.
    For instance, if we encounter the word ``deals``
    in running text, should this be analysed as the plural form of a
    noun, e.g., ``deal<subscript>N</subscript>+PL``
    or the third-person singular form of a verb, e.g.,
    ``deal<subscript>V</subscript>+3PS``?
    A tagger will consider the context in which this word appears,
    and will reliably determine whether it is a noun or a verb.
    Then the morphological analyser can be given either
    ``deals/NN`` or ``deals/VB``
    to process.
