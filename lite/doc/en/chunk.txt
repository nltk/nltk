Introduction
------------

Chunk parsing is an efficient and robust approach to parsing natural
language, and a popular alternative to the full parsing that we will
see in later chapters.  Chunks are non-overlapping regions of text,
usually consisting of a head word (such as a noun) and the adjacent
modifiers and function words (such as adjectives and determiners).

Motivation
----------

There are two chief motivations for chunking: to locate information,
or to ignore information.  In the former case, we may want to extract
all noun phrases so that they can be indexed.  A text retrieval system
could the use the index to support efficient retrieval for queries
involving terminological expressions.  A message understanding system
will extract salient chunks of text from a news story and populate a
database.

   The Message Understanding Process (from Abney 1996)

Consider the units that have been selected in this process:
a name (``Garcia Alvarado``), a verb cluster (``was killed``),
a locative prepositional phrase (``on his vehicle``).  These
are examples of ``NP``, ``VP`` and ``PP`` chunks.

The reverse side of the coin is to *ignore* information.  Suppose that
we want to study syntactic patterns, finding particular verbs in a
corpus and displaying their arguments.  For instance, here are uses of
the verb ``gave`` in the first 100 files of the Penn Treebank corpus.
NP-chunking has been used so that the internal details of each noun
phrase can be replaced with ``NP``::

  gave NP
  gave up NP in NP
  gave NP up
  gave NP help
  gave NP to NP
    
In this way we can acquire information about the complementation
patterns of a verb like ``gave``.  This information can then be used
in the development of a grammar.

Chunking: Analogy with Tokenization and Tagging
-----------------------------------------------

Two of the most common operations in language processing are
*segmentation* and *labelling*.  For example, tokenization *segments*
a sequence of characters into tokens, while tagging *labels* each of
these tokens.  Moreover, these two operations go hand in hand.  We
segment a stream of characters into linguistically meaningful pieces
(e.g.  as words) only so that we can classify those pieces (e.g. with
their part-of-speech categories) and then identify higher-level
structures.  The result of such classification is usually stored by
adding a label to the piece in question.  Now that we have mapped
characters to tagged-tokens, we will carry on with segmentation and
labelling at a higher level, as illustrated in the following diagram.
The solid boxes show word-level segmentation and labelling, while the
dashed boxes show a higher-level segmentation and labelling.  These
larger pieces are called *chunks*, and the process of identifying them
is called *chunking*, *chunk parsing*, *partial parsing*, or *light parsing*.

.. figure:: ../images/chunk-segmentation.png

   Segmentation and Labelling at both the Token and Chunk Levels

Chunking is like tokenization and tagging in other respects.  First,
chunking can skip over material in the input.  Observe that only some
of the tagged tokens have been chunked, while others are left out.
Compare this with the way that tokenization has omitted spaces and
punctuation characters.  Second, chunking typically uses
regular-expression based methods (also known as *finite-state
methods*) to identify material of interest.  For example, the chunk in
the above diagram could have been found by the expression
``<DT>?<JJ>*<NN>`` which matches an optional determiner, followed by
zero or more adjectives, followed by a noun.  Compare this with the
way that tokenization and tagging both make use of regular
expressions.  Third, chunking, like tokenization and tagging, is very
application-specific.  For example, while linguistic analysis and
information extraction both need to identify and label extents
of text, they typically require quite different definitions of those
extents.
    
Chunking vs Parsing
-------------------

Chunking is akin to parsing in the sense that it can be used to build
hierarchical structure over text.  There are several important
differences, however.  First, as noted above, chunking is not
exhaustive, and typically omits items in the surface string.  Second,
where parsing constructs nested deeply structures, chunking creates
structures of fixed depth (typically depth 2), and as fine-grained as
possible, as shown below::

  1. Parsing:
  [
    [ G.K. Chesterton ],
    [
      [ author ] of
      [
        [ The Man ] who was
        [ Thursday ]
      ]
    ]
  ]

  2. Chunking:
  [ G.K. Chesterton ],
  [ author ] of
  [ The Man ] who was
  [ Thursday ]

Another significant motivation for chunk parsing is its robustness and
efficiency relative to so-called full parsing.  The latter approach is
built around recursive phrase structure grammars, parsing strategies,
and arbitrary-depth trees.  Full parsing has problems with robustness,
given the difficulty in getting broad coverage and in resolving ambiguity.
Full parsing is also relatively inefficient, being O(`n`:superscript:`3`),
rather than O(n) as for chunk parsing.

Like tagging, chunking is an example of lightweight methodology in
natural language processing: how far can we get with identifying
linguistic structures (such as phrases, verb arguments, etc) with
recourse only to local, surface context.  Also like tagging, chunking
cannot be done perfectly.  For example, as pointed out by Abney
(1996), we cannot correctly analyze the structure of the sentence *I
turned off the spectroroute* without knowing the meaning of
*spectroroute*; is it a kind of road or a type of device?  Without
knowing this, we cannot tell whether *off* is part of a prepositional
phrase indicating direction, or whether *off* is part of the verb-particle
construction *turn off*::

  1. Prepositional phrase:
  [
    [ I ]
    [ turned ]
    [ off the spectroroute ]
  ]

  2. Verb-particle construction:
  [
    [ I ]
    [ turned off ]
    [ the spectroroute ]
  ]

However, we continue undeterred, to find out just how far we can get
with this lightweight parsing method.  We begin by considering the
representation of chunks and the available annotated corpora.  We then
show how chunks can be recognized using a chunk parser based on
matching regular expressions over sequences of part-of-speech tags.

Accessing Chunked Corpora
-------------------------

Representing Chunks: Tags vs Trees
----------------------------------

As befits its intermediate status between tagging and parsing,
chunk structures can be represented using either tags or trees.  The most
widespread file representation uses so-called ``IOB`` tags.  In this
scheme, each token is tagged with one of three special chunk tags,
``INSIDE``, ``OUTSIDE``, or ``BEGIN``.  A token is tagged as ``BEGIN``
if it is at the beginning of a chunk, and contained within that chunk.
Subsequent tokens within the chunk are tagged ``INSIDE``.  All other
tokens are tagged ``OUTSIDE``.  An example of this scheme is shown below:

.. figure:: ../images/chunk-tagrep.png

   Tag Representation of Chunk Structures

The other obvious representation for chunk structures is to use trees,
as shown below.  These have the benefit that each chunk is a
constituent that can be manipulated directly.  NLTK-Lite uses this
latter method for its internal representation of chunks:
    
.. figure:: ../images/chunk-treerep.png

   Tree Representation of Chunk Structures

A *chunk parser* finds contiguous, non-overlapping spans of related
tokens and groups them together into *chunks*.    
The chunk parser combines these individual chunks together, along with
the intervening tokens, to form a *chunk structure*.  A chunk
structure is a two-level tree that spans the entire text, and
contains both chunks and un-chunked tokens.  For example, the
following chunk structure captures the noun phrases in a sentence:

| (S: (NP: 'I')
|     'saw'
|     (NP: 'the' 'big' 'dog')
|     'on'
|     (NP: 'the' 'hill'))


Chunk parsers often operate on tagged texts, and use the tags to help
make chunking decisions.  A common string representation for chunked
tagged text is illustrated below.:
    
  [ the/DT little/JJ cat/NN ] sat/VBD on/IN [ the/DT mat/NN ]

This can be parsed using ``tree.chunk()`` function as shown.
    
  >>> from nltk_lite.parse import tree
  >>> tree.chunk("[ the/DT little/JJ cat/NN ] sat/VBD on/IN [ the/DT mat/NN ]")
  (S: (NP: ('the', 'DT') ('little', 'JJ') ('cat', 'NN')) ('sat', 'VBD') ('on', 'IN') (NP: ('the', 'DT') ('mat', 'NN')))
    
We usually want to read structured data from corpora, not strings.  In
the following sections we show how this is done for two popular
chunked corpus formats, namely bracketed text and IOB-tagged data.
    
Reading chunk structures from bracketed text
--------------------------------------------

We can obtain a larger quantity of chunked text from the tagged Wall
Street Journal in the Penn Treebank corpus.  NLTK-Lite includes a sample of
this corpus.  The tagged section of the corpus consists of chunked,
tagged text, such as the annotated sentence shown below::

| In/IN 
| [ happier/JJR news/NN ]
| ,/, 
| [ South/NNP Korea/NNP ]
| ,/, in/IN establishing/VBG 
| [ diplomatic/JJ ties/NNS ]
| with/IN 
| [ Poland/NNP yesterday/NN ]
| ,/, announced/VBD 
| [ $/$ 450/CD million/CD ]
| in/IN 
| [ loans/NNS ]
| to/TO 
| [ the/DT ]
| financially/RB strapped/VBN 
| [ Warsaw/NNP government/NN ]
| ./. 

We can read in a chunked sentence as follows:

    >>> from nltk_lite.corpora import treebank, extract
    >>> chunk_tree = extract(603, treebank.chunked())
    >>> print chunk_tree
    (S:
      ('In', 'IN')
      (NP: ('happier', 'JJR') ('news', 'NN'))
      (',', ',')
      (NP: ('South', 'NNP') ('Korea', 'NNP'))
      (',', ',')
      ('in', 'IN')
      ('establishing', 'VBG')
      (NP: ('diplomatic', 'JJ') ('ties', 'NNS'))
      ('with', 'IN')
      (NP: ('Poland', 'NNP') ('yesterday', 'NN'))
      (',', ',')
      ('announced', 'VBD')
      (NP: ('$', '$') ('450', 'CD') ('million', 'CD'))
      ('in', 'IN')
      (NP: ('loans', 'NNS'))
      ('to', 'TO')
      (NP: ('the', 'DT'))
      ('financially', 'RB')
      ('strapped', 'VBN')
      (NP: ('Warsaw', 'NNP') ('government', 'NN'))
      ('.', '.'))




We can display this tree graphically using the ``nltk_lite.draw.tree``
module::

  from nltk_lite.draw.tree import *
  chunk_tree.draw()

Reading chunked text from IOB-tagged data
-----------------------------------------

Using the ``nltk_lite.corpora`` module we can load files that have been
chunked using the IOB (``INSIDE/OUTSIDE/BEGIN``) notation, such as
that provided by the evaluation competitions run by CoNLL, the
*Conference on Natural Language Learning*.  In the CoNLL format, each
sentence is represented in a file as a multi-line string, as shown
below::
    
  he PRP B-NP
  accepted VBD B-VP
  the DT B-NP
  position NN I-NP
  ...

Each line consists of a word, its part-of-speech, the chunk category
``B`` (begin), ``I`` (inside) or ``O`` (outside), and the chunk type
``NP``, ``VP`` or ``PP``.  The CoNLL chunk reader ``parse.conll_chunk()`` parses this
information into a chunk structure.  Moreover, it permits us to choose
any subset of the three chunk types to use (by default it includes all
three).  The example below produces only ``NP`` chunks:
    
    >>> from nltk_lite import parse
    >>> text = """
    ... he PRP B-NP
    ... accepted VBD B-VP
    ... the DT B-NP
    ... position NN I-NP
    ... of IN B-PP
    ... vice NN B-NP
    ... chairman NN I-NP
    ... of IN B-PP
    ... Carlyle NNP B-NP
    ... Group NNP I-NP
    ... , , O
    ... a DT B-NP
    ... merchant NN I-NP
    ... banking NN I-NP
    ... concern NN I-NP
    ... . . O
    ... """
    >>> print parse.conll_chunk(text)
    (S:
      (NP: ('he', 'PRP'))
      ('accepted', 'VBD')
      (NP: ('the', 'DT') ('position', 'NN'))
      ('of', 'IN')
      (NP: ('vice', 'NN') ('chairman', 'NN'))
      ('of', 'IN')
      (NP: ('Carlyle', 'NNP') ('Group', 'NNP'))
      (',', ',')
      (NP:
        ('a', 'DT')
        ('merchant', 'NN')
        ('banking', 'NN')
        ('concern', 'NN'))
      ('.', '.'))
  
We can load the CoNLL 2000 corpus using the CoNLL corpus reader
``corpora.conll2000.chunked()``.

This concludes our discussion of loading chunked data.  In the rest of
this chapter we will see how chunked data can be created from
tokenized text, chunked using a chunk parser, then evaluated against
the so-called gold-standard data.
  
Exercises
---------

#. **IOB Tagging:**
   A common file representation of chunks uses the tags ``BEGIN``,
   ``INSIDE`` and ``OUTSIDE``.  Why are three tags necessary?  What
   problem would be caused if we used ``INSIDE`` and ``OUTSIDE`` tags
   exclusively?
        
#. **CoNLL 2000 Corpus:**
   In this section we saw how chunked data could be read from the Treebank
   corpus.  Write a similar program to access the first sentence of the
   CoNLL 2000 corpus.  You will need to import the ``conll2000`` module
   from the ``nltk_lite.corpora`` package.

#. **Format Conversion:**
   We have seen two file formats for chunk data, and NLTK-Lite provides corpus
   readers for both.

   a) Write functions ``chunk2brackets()`` and ``chunk2iob()`` which take a single
      chunk structure as their sole argument, and return the required multi-line string
      representation.
   b) Write command-line conversion utilities ``bracket2iob.py`` and ``iob2bracket.py``
      that take a file in Treebank or CoNLL format (resp) and convert it to the other
      format.

Chunk Parsing
-------------

Chunking with Regular Expressions
---------------------------------

Earlier we noted that chunking builds flat (or non-nested) structures.
In practice, the extents of text to be chunked are identified using
regular expressions over sequences of part-of-speech tags.  NLTK-Lite
provides a regular expression chunk parser, ``parse.RegexpChunk`` to
define the kinds of chunk we are interested in, and then to chunk a
tagged text.
    
``RegexpChunk`` works by manipulating a *chunk structure*, which
represents a particular chunking of the text.  The chunk parser begins
with a structure in which no tokens are chunked.  Each
regular-expression pattern (or *chunk rule*) is applied in turn,
successively updating the chunk structure.  Once all of the rules have
been applied, the resulting chunk structure is returned.
    
In order to define chunk rules, we first need to introduce the notion of 
"tag strings."  A *tag string* is a string consisting of tags
delimited with angle-brackets, e.g., ``<DT><JJ><NN><VBD><DT><NN>``.
(Note that tag strings do not contain any whitespace.)  We can now create 
a special kind of regular expression pattern over tag strings, called
a *tag pattern*.  An example of a tag pattern is 
``<DT><JJ>?<NN>``, which matches a determiner followed by an optional adjective,
followed by a noun. Tag patterns are similar to the regular expression
patterns we have already seen, except for three differences which make
them easier to use for chunk parsing.  First, the angle brackets group
their contents into atomic units, so "``<NN>+``" matches one or more
repetitions of the tag string "``<NN>``"; and "``<NN|JJ>``" matches the tag strings "``<NN>``" or
"``<JJ>``."  Second, the period wildcard operator is constrained not
to cross tag boundaries, so that "``<NN.*>``" matches any single
tag starting with "``NN``."

.. Finally, whitespace is ignored in tag
   patterns, so "``<DT> | <NN>``" is equivalent to
   "``<DT>|<NN>``"; this allows tag patterns to be formatted to
   improve readability. (Note however that ``<DT> <JJ> | <NN>`` is not permitted, since this
   introduces whitespace into the tag string to the left of the disjunction ``|``.) ????
    
Now that we can define tag patterns, it is a straightforward matter to
set up an chunk parser.  The simplest type of rule is
``ChunkRule``.  This chunks anything that matches a given tag pattern.
``ChunkRule`` takes a tag pattern and a description
string as arguments.  Here is a rule which chunks sequences consisting of one or
more words tagged as ``DT`` or ``NN`` (i.e. determiners and nouns).
    
    >>> rule = parse.ChunkRule('<DT|NN>+',
    ...                  'Chunk sequences of DT and NN')

Now we can define a regular expression chunk parser based on this rule as
follows:

    >>> chunkparser = parse.RegexpChunk([rule], chunk_node='NP', top_node='S')

Note that ``RegexpChunk`` has optional second and third arguments that
specify the node labels for chunks and for the top-level node,
respectively.  Now we can use this to chunk a tagged sentence, as
illustrated by the complete program below.

.. Note: Each rule must have a "description" associated with it, which
   provides a short explanation of the purpose or the effect of the rule.
   This description is accessed via the ``descr()`` method.
    
    >>> from nltk_lite import tag
    >>> sent = tag.string2tags("the/DT little/JJ cat/NN sat/VBD on/IN the/DT mat/NN")
    >>> rule = parse.ChunkRule('<NN|DT>+',
    ...                  'Chunk sequences of NN and DT')
    >>> parser = parse.RegexpChunk([rule], chunk_node='NP', top_node='S')
    >>> parser.parse(sent)
    (S: (NP: ('the', 'DT')) ('little', 'JJ') (NP: ('cat', 'NN')) ('sat', 'VBD') ('on', 'IN') (NP: ('the', 'DT') ('mat', 'NN')))

We can also use more complex tag patterns, such as
``<DT>?<JJ.*>*<NN.*>``.  This can be used to chunk any sequence of
tokens beginning with an optional determiner ``DT``, followed by zero
or more adjectives of any type ``JJ.*``, followed by a single noun of
any type ``NN.*``.

If a tag pattern matches at multiple overlapping locations, the first
match takes precedence.  For example, if we apply a rule that matches
two consecutive nouns to a text containing three consecutive nouns,
then the first two nouns will be chunked:

    >>> from nltk_lite import tag
    >>> text = "dog/NN cat/NN mouse/NN"
    >>> nouns = tag.string2tags(text)
    >>> rule = parse.ChunkRule('<NN><NN>', 'Chunk two consecutive nouns')
    >>> parser = parse.RegexpChunk([rule], chunk_node='NP', top_node='S')
    >>> parser.parse(nouns)
    (S: (NP: ('dog', 'NN') ('cat', 'NN')) ('mouse', 'NN'))


Developing Chunk Parsers
------------------------

Creating a good chunk parser usually requires several iterations of
development and testing, during which existing rules are refined and
new rules are added.  In a later section we will describe an automatic
evaluation method that can be used to support this development
process.  Here we show how to trace the execution of a chunk parser,
to help the developer diagnose any problems.

``RegexpChunk`` has an optional ``trace`` argument, which specifies
whether debugging output should be shown during parsing.  This output
shows the rules that are applied, and shows the chunking hypothesis at
each stage of processing.  In the execution trace, chunks are
indicated by braces.  In the following example, two chunking rules are
applied to the input sentence.  The first rule finds all sequences of
three tokens whose tags are ``DT``, ``JJ``, and ``NN``, and the second
rule finds any sequence of tokens whose tags are either ``DT`` or
``NN``.
      
    >>> sent = tag.string2tags("the/DT little/JJ cat/NN sat/VBD on/IN the/DT mat/NN")
    >>> rule1 = parse.ChunkRule('<DT><JJ><NN>', 'Chunk det+adj+noun')
    >>> rule2 = parse.ChunkRule('<DT|NN>+', 'Chunk sequences of NN and DT')
    >>> chunkparser = parse.RegexpChunk([rule1, rule2], chunk_node='NP', top_node='S')
    >>> chunk_tree = chunkparser.parse(sent, trace=1)
    Input:
                    <DT>  <JJ>  <NN>  <VBD>  <IN>  <DT>  <NN> 
    Chunk det+adj+noun:
                   {<DT>  <JJ>  <NN>} <VBD>  <IN>  <DT>  <NN> 
    Chunk sequences of NN and DT:
                   {<DT>  <JJ>  <NN>} <VBD>  <IN> {<DT>  <NN>}

When a ``ChunkRule`` is applied to a chunking hypothesis, it will only
create chunks that do not partially overlap with chunks already in the
hypothesis.  Thus, if we apply these two rules in reverse order, we
will get a different result:

    >>> chunkparser = parse.RegexpChunk([rule2, rule1], chunk_node='NP', top_node='S')
    >>> chunk_tree = chunkparser.parse(sent, trace=1)
    Input:
                    <DT>  <JJ>  <NN>  <VBD>  <IN>  <DT>  <NN> 
    Chunk sequences of NN and DT:
                   {<DT>} <JJ> {<NN>} <VBD>  <IN> {<DT>  <NN>}
    Chunk det+adj+noun:
                   {<DT>} <JJ> {<NN>} <VBD>  <IN> {<DT>  <NN>}

Here, rule 2 ("chunk det+adj+noun") did not find any chunks, since all
chunks that matched its tag pattern overlapped with chunks that were
already in the hypothesis.


Exercises
---------

#. **Chunker:**
   Pick one of the three chunk types in the CoNLL corpus.
   Inspect the CoNLL corpus and try to observe any patterns in the POS tag sequences
   that make up this kind of chunk.  Develop a simple chunker using
   ``ChunkRule`` and the regular-expression chunk parser ``RegexpChunk``.
   Discuss any tag sequences that are difficult to chunk reliably.

#. **Automatic Analysis:**
   Pick one of the three chunk types in the CoNLL corpus.  Write functions
   to do the following tasks for your chosen type:

   a) List all the tag sequences that occur with each instance of this chunk type.
   b) Count the frequency of each tag sequence, and produce a ranked list in
      order of decreasing frequency; each line should consist of an integer (the frequency)
      and the tag sequence.
   c) Inspect the high-frequency tag sequences.  Use these as the basis for
      developing a better chunker.


-------------------
More Chunking Rules
-------------------

Sometimes it is easier to define what we *don't* want to include in a
chunk than it is to define what we *do* want to include.  In these
cases, it may be easier to build a chunk parser using ``ChinkRule`` and ``UnChunkRule``.

The Chink Rule
--------------
      
The word *chink* initially meant a sequence of stopwords,
according to a 1975 paper by Ross and Tukey (cited by Abney in the
recommended reading for this chapter).
Following Abney, we define a *chink* is a sequence
of tokens that is not included in a chunk.
In the following example, ``sat/VBD on/IN`` is a chink::

  [ the/DT little/JJ cat/NN ] sat/VBD on/IN [ the/DT mat/NN ]

*Chinking* is the process of removing a sequence of tokens from a
chunk.  If the sequence of tokens spans an entire chunk, then the
whole chunk is removed; if the sequence of tokens appears in the
middle of the chunk, these tokens are removed, leaving two chunks
where there was only one before.  If the sequence is at the beginning
or end of the chunk, these tokens are removed, and a smaller chunk
remains.  These three possibilities are illustrated in the following
table:

===========  ==========================  ======================  ======================
Chinking
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
             Entire chunk                Middle of a chunk       End of a chunk
===========  ==========================  ======================  ======================
*Input*      [a/DT  big/JJ  cat/NN]      [a/DT  big/JJ  cat/NN]  [a/DT  big/JJ  cat/NN]
*Operation*  Chink "a/DT big/JJ cat/NN"  Chink "big/JJ"          Chink "cat/DT"
*Output*     a/DT  big/JJ  cat/NN        [a/DT] big/JJ [cat/NN]  [a/DT  big/JJ] cat/NN
===========  ==========================  ======================  ======================

A ``ChinkRule`` chinks anything that matches a given tag pattern.
ChinkRules are created with the ``ChinkRule`` constructor, which
takes a tag pattern and a description string.  For example, the
following rule will chink any sequence of tokens whose tags are all
"``VBD``" or "``IN``":

  >>> chink_rule = parse.ChinkRule('<VBD|IN>+',
  ...                        'Chink sequences of VBD and IN')

Remember that ``RegexpChunk`` begins with a chunking hypothesis
where nothing is chunked.  So before we apply our chink rule, we'll
apply another rule that puts the entire sentence in a single chunk:

    >>> chunkall_rule = parse.ChunkRule('<.*>+',
    ...                           'Chunk everything')

Finally, we can combine these two rules to create a chunk parser:

    >>> chunkparser = parse.RegexpChunk([chunkall_rule, chink_rule],
    ...                 chunk_node='NP', top_node='S')
    >>> chunk_tree = chunkparser.parse(sent, trace=1)
    Input:
                    <DT>  <JJ>  <NN>  <VBD>  <IN>  <DT>  <NN> 
    Chunk everything:
                   {<DT>  <JJ>  <NN>  <VBD>  <IN>  <DT>  <NN>}
    Chink sequences of VBD and IN:
                   {<DT>  <JJ>  <NN>} <VBD>  <IN> {<DT>  <NN>}

If a tag pattern matches at multiple overlapping locations, the first
match takes precedence.

.. Note: Cascading Rules: ``RegexpChunk`` can use any number of
   ``ChunkRules`` and ``ChinkRules``, in any order.  As was discussed
   above, ``ChunkRules`` only create chunks that do not partially overlap
   with chunks already in the chunking hypothesis.  Similarly,
   ``ChinkRules`` only create chinks that do not partially overlap with
   chinks that are already in the hypothesis.

The Unchunk Rule
----------------
    
An ``UnChunkRule`` removes any chunk that matches a given tag pattern.
``UnChunkRule`` is very similar to ``ChinkRule``; but it will only
remove a chunk if the tag pattern matches the entire chunk.  In
contrast, ``ChinkRule`` can remove sequences of tokens from the middle
of a chunk.

``UnChunkRule``\ s are created with the ``UnChunkRule`` constructor,
which takes a tag pattern and a description string.  For example, the
following rule will unchunk any sequence of tokens whose tags are all
``NN`` or ``DT``:
      
    >>> unchunk_rule = parse.UnChunkRule('<NN|DT>+',
    ...                        'Unchunk sequences of NN and DT')

We can combine this rule with a chunking rule to form a chunk parser:

    >>> chunk_rule = parse.ChunkRule('<NN|DT|JJ>+',
    ...                        'Chunk sequences of NN, JJ, and DT')
    >>> chunkparser = parse.RegexpChunk([chunk_rule, unchunk_rule],
    ...                 chunk_node='NP', top_node='S')
    >>> chunk_tree = chunkparser.parse(sent, trace=1)
    Input:
                    <DT>  <JJ>  <NN>  <VBD>  <IN>  <DT>  <NN> 
    Chunk sequences of NN, JJ, and DT:
                   {<DT>  <JJ>  <NN>} <VBD>  <IN> {<DT>  <NN>}
    Unchunk sequences of NN and DT:
                   {<DT>  <JJ>  <NN>} <VBD>  <IN>  <DT>  <NN> 

Note that we would get a different result if we used a ``ChinkRule``
with the same tag pattern (instead of an ``UnChunkRule``), since
chink rules can remove pieces of a chunk:
      
    >>> chink_rule = parse.ChinkRule('<NN|DT>+',
    ...                            'Chink sequences of NN and DT')
    >>> chunk_rule = parse.ChunkRule('<NN|DT|JJ>+',
    ...                        'Chunk sequences of NN, JJ, and DT')
    >>> chunkparser = parse.RegexpChunk([chunk_rule, chink_rule],
    ...                 chunk_node='NP', top_node='S')
    >>> chunk_tree = chunkparser.parse(sent, trace=1)
    Input:
                    <DT>  <JJ>  <NN>  <VBD>  <IN>  <DT>  <NN> 
    Chunk sequences of NN, JJ, and DT:
                   {<DT>  <JJ>  <NN>} <VBD>  <IN> {<DT>  <NN>}
    Chink sequences of VBD and IN:
                   {<DT>  <JJ>  <NN>} <VBD>  <IN> {<DT>  <NN>}

The Merge Rule
--------------

When constructing complex chunk parsers, it is often convenient to
perform operations other than chunking, chinking, and unchunking.  In
this section and the next, we discuss two more complex rules which can
be used to merge and split chunks.

``MergeRules`` are used to merge two contiguous chunks.  Each
``MergeRule`` is parameterized by two tag patterns: a left pattern and
a right pattern.  A ``MergeRule`` will merge two contiguous chunks
`C`:subscript:`1` and `C`:subscript:`2` if the end of `C`:subscript:`1`
matches the left pattern, and the beginning of `C`:subscript:`2`
matches the right pattern. For example, consider the following
chunking hypothesis:

  [the/DT little/JJ] [cat/NN]

Where `C`:subscript:`1` is ``[the/DT little/JJ]`` and `C`:subscript:`2`
is ``[cat/NN]``.  If the left pattern is ``JJ``, and the right
pattern is ``NN``, then `C`:subscript:`1` and `C`:subscript:`2` will
be merged to form a single chunk:

  [the/DT little/JJ cat/NN]

``MergeRule``\ s are created with the ``MergeRule`` constructor, which
takes a left tag pattern, a right tag pattern, and a description
string.  For example, the following rule will merge two contiguous
chunks if the first one ends in a determiner, noun or adjective; and
the second one begins in a determiner, noun, or adjective:

    >>> merge_rule = parse.MergeRule('<NN|DT|JJ>', '<NN|DT|JJ>',
    ...                       'Merge NNs + DTs + JJs')

To illustrate this rule, we will use a combine it with a chunking rule
that chunks each individual token, and an unchunking rule that
unchunks verbs and prepositions:

    >>> chunk_rule = parse.ChunkRule('<.*>',
    ...                     'Chunk all individual tokens')
    >>> unchunk_rule = parse.UnChunkRule('<IN|VB.*>',
    ...                         'Unchunk VBs and INs')
    >>> rules = [chunk_rule, unchunk_rule, merge_rule]
    >>> chunkparser = parse.RegexpChunk(rules, chunk_node='NP', top_node='S')
    >>> chunk_tree = chunkparser.parse(sent, trace=1)
    Input:
                    <DT>  <JJ>  <NN>  <VBD>  <IN>  <DT>  <NN> 
    Chunk all individual tokens:
                   {<DT>}{<JJ>}{<NN>}{<VBD>}{<IN>}{<DT>}{<NN>}
    Unchunk VBs and INs:
                   {<DT>}{<JJ>}{<NN>} <VBD>  <IN> {<DT>}{<NN>}
    Merge NNs + DTs + JJs:
                   {<DT>  <JJ>  <NN>} <VBD>  <IN> {<DT>  <NN>}

The Split Rule
--------------

``SplitRule``\ s are used to split a single chunk into two smaller
chunks.  Each ``SplitRule`` is parameterized by two tag patterns: a
left pattern and a right pattern.  A ``SplitRule`` will split a chunk
at any point *p*, where the left pattern matches the chunk to the left
of *p*, and the right pattern matches the chunk to the right of *p*.
For example, consider the following chunking hypothesis::

  [the/DT little/JJ cat/NN the/DT dog/NN]

If the left pattern is ``NN``, and the right pattern is ``DT``,
then the chunk will be split in two between ``cat`` and ``dog``,
to form two smaller chunks::

  [the/DT little/JJ cat/NN] [the/DT dog/NN]

``SplitRule``\ s are created with the ``SplitRule`` constructor, which
takes a left tag pattern, a right tag pattern, and a description
string.  For example, the following rule will split any chunk at a
location that has ``NN`` to the left and ``DT`` to the right:

  >>> split_rule = parse.SplitRule('<NN>', '<DT>',
  ...                     'Split NN followed by DT')

To illustrate this rule, we will use a combine it with a chunking rule
that chunks sequences of noun phrases, adjectives, and determiners:

    >>> sent = tag.string2tags('Bob/NNP saw/VBD the/DT man/NN the/DT cat/NN chased/VBD')
    >>> chunk_rule = parse.ChunkRule('<NN.*|DT|JJ>+',
    ...                        'Chunk sequences of NN, JJ, and DT')
    >>> chunkparser = parse.RegexpChunk([chunk_rule, split_rule],
    ...                 chunk_node='NP', top_node='S')
    >>> chunk_tree = chunkparser.parse(sent, trace=1)
    Input:
                   <NNP>  <VBD>  <DT>  <NN>  <DT>  <NN>  <VBD> 
    Chunk sequences of NN, JJ, and DT:
                  {<NNP>} <VBD> {<DT>  <NN>  <DT>  <NN>} <VBD> 
    Split NN followed by DT:
                  {<NNP>} <VBD> {<DT>  <NN>}{<DT>  <NN>} <VBD>

#. An early definition of *chunk* was the material that occurs between chinks.
   Develop a chunker which starts by putting the whole sentence in a single
   chunk, and then does the rest of its work solely using chink rules.
   Determine which tags (or tag sequences) are most likely to make up chinks
   with the help of your own utility program.  Compare the performance and
   simplicity of this approach relative to a chunker based entirely on
   chunk rules.

------------------------
Evaluating Chunk Parsers
------------------------

An easy way to evaluate a chunk parser is to take some already chunked
text, strip off the chunks, rechunk it, and compare the result with
the original chunked text.  The ``ChunkScore.score()`` function takes
the correctly chunked sentence as its first argument, and the newly
chunked version as its second argument, and compares them.  It reports
the fraction of actual chunks that were found (recall), the fraction
of hypothesized chunks that were correct (precision), and a combined
score, the F-measure (the harmonic mean of precision and recall).
    
A number of different metrics can be used to evaluate chunk parsers.
We will concentrate on a class of metrics that can be derived from two
sets:

* **guessed**: The set of chunks returned by the chunk parser. 
* **correct**: The correct set of chunks, as defined in the test corpus.

The evaluate method we will use comes from the field of information retrieval,
and considers the performance of a document retrieval system.  We will set up
an analogy between the correct set of chunks and a user's so-called "information need",
and between the set of returned chunks and a system's returned documents.  Consider
the following diagram.

.. figure:: ../images/precision-recall.png

   Precision and Recall

The intersection of these sets defines four regions: the true
positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false
negatives (FN).  Two standard measures are
*precision*, the fraction of guessed chunks that were correct TP/(TP+FP),
and *recall*, the fraction of correct chunks that were identified
TP/(TP+FN).  A third measure, the *F measure*, is the harmonic mean
of precision and recall, i.e. 1(0.5/Precision + 0.5/Recall)

.. Note: Note that these metrics do not assign any credit for chunks
   that are "almost" right (e.g., chunks that extend one word too long).
   It would be possible to design metrics that do assign partial credit
   for such cases, they would be more complex.  We decided to keep our
   metrics simple, so that it is easy to understand what a given result
   means.

During evaluation of a chunk parser, it is useful to flatten a chunk
structure into a list of tokens.  Since chunk structures are just
trees, we use the ``leaves()`` method to extract this flattened list.
Note that we must always include location information when evaluating
a chunk parser.

    >>> correct = tree.chunk("[ the/DT little/JJ cat/NN ] sat/VBD on/IN [ the/DT mat/NN ]")
    >>> correct.leaves()
    [('the', 'DT'), ('little', 'JJ'), ('cat', 'NN'), ('sat', 'VBD'), ('on', 'IN'), ('the', 'DT'), ('mat', 'NN')]

Now we run a chunker, and then compare the resulting chunked sentences
with the originals, as follows:

    >>> from nltk_lite import parse
    >>> chunkscore = parse.ChunkScore()
    >>> rule = parse.ChunkRule('<PRP|DT|POS|JJ|CD|N.*>+', "Chunk items that often occur in NPs")
    >>> chunkparser = parse.RegexpChunk([rule], chunk_node='NP', top_node='S')
    >>> guess = chunkparser.parse(correct.leaves())
    >>> chunkscore.score(correct, guess)
    >>> print chunkscore
    ChunkParse score:
        Precision: 100.0%
        Recall:    100.0%
        F-Measure: 100.0%

``ChunkScore`` is a class for scoring chunk parsers.  It can be used
to evaluate the output of a chunk parser, using precision, recall,
f-measure, missed chunks, and incorrect chunks.  It can also be used
to combine the scores from the parsing of multiple texts.  This is
quite useful if we are parsing a text one sentence at a time.  The
following program listing shows a typical use of the ``ChunkScore``
class.  In this example, ``chunkparser`` is being tested on each
sentence from the Wall Street Journal tagged files.

    >>> from itertools import islice
    >>> rule = parse.ChunkRule('<DT|JJ|NN>+', "Chunk sequences of DT, JJ, and NN")
    >>> chunkparser = parse.RegexpChunk([rule], chunk_node='NP', top_node='S')
    >>> chunkscore = parse.ChunkScore()
    >>> for chunk_struct in islice(treebank.chunked(), 10):
    ...     test_sent = chunkparser.parse(chunk_struct.leaves())
    ...     chunkscore.score(chunk_struct, test_sent)
    >>> print chunkscore
    ChunkParse score:
        Precision:  48.6%
        Recall:     34.0%
        F-Measure:  40.0%

The overall results of the evaluation can be viewed by printing the
``ChunkScore``.  Each evaluation metric is also returned by an
accessor method: ``precision()``, ``recall``, ``f_measure``,
``missed``, and ``incorrect``.  The ``missed`` and ``incorrect``
methods can be especially useful when trying to improve the
performance of a chunk parser.  Here are the missed chunks:

    >>> from random import randint
    >>> missed = chunkscore.missed()
    >>> for i in range(15):
    ...     print missed[randint(0,len(missed)-1)]
    (('A', 'DT'), ('Lorillard', 'NNP'), ('spokewoman', 'NN'))
    (('it', 'PRP'),)
    (('symptoms', 'NNS'),)
    (('even', 'RB'), ('brief', 'JJ'), ('exposures', 'NNS'))
    (('its', 'PRP$'), ('Micronite', 'NN'), ('cigarette', 'NN'), ('filters', 'NNS'))
    (('30', 'CD'), ('years', 'NNS'))
    (('workers', 'NNS'),)
    (('preliminary', 'JJ'), ('findings', 'NNS'))
    (('Medicine', 'NNP'),)
    (('cancer', 'NN'), ('deaths', 'NNS'))
    (('Consolidated', 'NNP'), ('Gold', 'NNP'), ('Fields', 'NNP'), ('PLC', 'NNP'))
    (('Medicine', 'NNP'),)
    (('its', 'PRP$'), ('Micronite', 'NN'), ('cigarette', 'NN'), ('filters', 'NNS'))
    (('a', 'DT'), ('forum', 'NN'))
    (('researchers', 'NNS'),)

Here are the incorrect chunks:

    >>> incorrect = chunkscore.incorrect()
    >>> for i in range(15):
    ...     print incorrect[randint(0,len(incorrect)-1)]
    (('New', 'JJ'), ('York-based', 'JJ'))
    (('Micronite', 'NN'), ('cigarette', 'NN'))
    (('a', 'DT'), ('forum', 'NN'), ('likely', 'JJ'))
    (('later', 'JJ'),)
    (('later', 'JJ'),)
    (('brief', 'JJ'),)
    (('preliminary', 'JJ'),)
    (('New', 'JJ'), ('York-based', 'JJ'))
    (('resilient', 'JJ'),)
    (('group', 'NN'),)
    (('cancer', 'NN'),)
    (('the', 'DT'),)
    (('cancer', 'NN'),)
    (('Micronite', 'NN'), ('cigarette', 'NN'))
    (('A', 'DT'),)

.. Note: By default, only the first 100 missed chunks and the first
   100 incorrect chunks will be remembered by the ``ChunkScore``.  You
   can tell ``ChunkScore`` to record more chunk examples with the
   ``max_fp_examples`` (maximum false positive examples) and the
   ``max_fn_examples`` (maximum false negative examples) keyword
   arguments to the ``ChunkScore`` constructor:

    >>> chunkscore = parse.ChunkScore(max_fp_examples=1000,
    ...                        max_fn_examples=1000)

When evaluating a chunker it is important to score it against the
baseline performance of a very simple chunker.  Perhaps the most naive
chunking method is to classify every tag in the training data as to
whether it occurs inside or outside a chunk more often.  We can do
this easily using a chunked corpus and a conditional frequency
distribution as shown below:

    >>> from nltk_lite.probability import ConditionalFreqDist
    >>> from nltk_lite.parse import Tree
    >>> import re
    >>> cfdist = ConditionalFreqDist()
    >>> chunk_data = list(treebank.chunked())
    >>> split = len(chunk_data)*9/10
    >>> train, test = chunk_data[:split], chunk_data[split:]
    >>> for chunk_struct in train:
    ...     for constituent in chunk_struct:
    ...         if isinstance(constituent, Tree):
    ...             for (word, tag) in constituent.leaves():
    ...                 cfdist[tag].inc(True)
    ...         else:
    ...             (word, tag) = constituent
    ...             cfdist[tag].inc(False)
  
    >>> chunk_tags = [tag for tag in cfdist.conditions() if cfdist[tag].max() == True]
    >>> chunk_tags = [re.sub(r'(\W)', r'\\\1', tag) for tag in chunk_tags]
    >>> tag_pattern = '<' + '|'.join(chunk_tags) + '>+'
    >>> print 'Chunking:', tag_pattern
    Chunking: <PRP\$|VBG\|NN|POS|WDT|JJ|WP|DT|\#|\$|NN|FW|PRP|NNS|NNP|LS|PDT|RBS|CD|EX|WP\$|NNPS|JJS|JJR>+

Now, in the evaluation phase we chunk any sequence of those tags:

    >>> rule = parse.ChunkRule(tag_pattern, 'Chunk any sequence involving commonly chunked tags')
    >>> chunkparser = parse.RegexpChunk([rule], chunk_node='NP', top_node='S')
    >>> chunkscore = parse.ChunkScore()
    >>> for chunk_struct in test:
    ...     test_sent = chunkparser.parse(chunk_struct.leaves())
    ...     chunkscore.score(chunk_struct, test_sent)
    >>> print chunkscore
    ChunkParse score:
        Precision:  90.7%
        Recall:     94.0%
        F-Measure:  92.3%

----------
Conclusion
----------

In this chapter we have explored a robust method for identifying
structure in text using chunk parsers.  There are a surprising number
of different ways to chunk a sentence.  The chunk rules can add, shift
and remove chunk delimiters in many ways, and the chunk rules can be
combined in many ways.  One can use a small number of very complex
rules, or a long sequence of much simpler rules.  One can hand-craft a
collection of rules, or train up a brute-force method using existing
chunked text.

We have seen that the same light-weight methods that were successful in
tagging can be applied in the recognition of simple linguistic structure.
The resulting structured information is useful in information extraction
tasks and in the description of the syntactic environments of words.
The latter will be invaluable as we move to full parsing.

#. **Chunking Demonstration:**
   Run the chunking demonstration::

      from nltk_lite.parse import chunk
      chunk.demo()  # the chunk parser

#. **Chunker Evaluation:**
   For any of the chunkers you have developed earlier:

   a) Evaluate your chunker on 100 sentences from a chunked corpus,
      and report the precision, recall and F-measure.
   b) Use the ``chunkscore.missed()`` and ``chunkscore.incorrect()``
      methods to identify the errors made by your chunker.  Discuss.
   c) Compare the performance of your chunker to the baseline chunker
      discussed in the evaluation section of this chapter.

#. **Predicate structure:**
   Develop an NP chunker which converts POS-tagged text into a list of
   tuples, where each tuple consists of a verb followed by a sequence of
   noun phrases and prepositions,
   e.g. ``the little cat sat on the mat`` becomes ``('sat', 'on', 'NP')``...
        
#. (Advanced) **Chunking by Tagging:**
   Apply the n-gram and Brill tagging methods to IOB chunk tagging.
   Instead of assigning POS tags to words, here we will assign IOB tags
   to the POS tags.  E.g. if the tag ``DT`` (determiner) often occurs
   at the start of a chunk, it will be tagged ``B`` (begin).  Evaluate
   the performance of these chunking methods relative to the regular
   expression chunking methods covered in this chapter.

#. (Advanced) **Modularity:**
   Consider the way an n-gram tagger uses recent tags to inform its tagging choice.
   Now observe how a chunker may re-use this sequence information.  For example,
   both tasks will make use of the information that nouns tend to follow adjectives
   (in English).  It would appear that the same information is being maintained in
   two places.  Is this likely to become a problem as the size of the rule sets grows?
   If so, speculate about any ways that this problem might be addressed.
