Introduction
------------

This chapter provides an introduction to regular expressions
illustrated with examples from language processing.
    
We have already noted that a text can be viewed as a string of
characters. What kinds of processing are performed at the character
level?  Perhaps word games are the most familiar example of such
processing.  In completing a crossword we may want to know which
3-letter English words end with the letter ``c`` (e.g.  ``arc``).  We
might want to know how many words can be formed from the letters:
``a``, ``c``, ``e``, ``o``, and ``n`` (e.g. ``ocean``).  We may want
to find out which unique English word contains the substring ``gnt``
(left as an exercise for the reader).  In all these examples, we are
considering which word &mdash; drawn from a large set of candidates
&mdash; matches a given pattern. To put this in a more computational
framework, we could imagine searching through a large digital corpus
in order to find all words that match a particular pattern. There are
many serious uses of this so-called *pattern matching*.

One instructive example is the task of finding all doubled words in a
text; an example would be the string ``for for example``. Notice that
we would be particularly interested in finding cases where the words
were split across a linebreak (in practise, most erroneously doubled
words occur in this context). Consequently, even with such a
relatively banal task, we need to be able to describe patterns which
refer not just to "ordinary" characters, but also to formatting
information.

There are conventions for indicating structure in strings, also known
as *formatting*. For example, there are a number of alternative ways
of formatting a "date string", such as ``23/06/2002``, ``6/23/02``, or
``2002-06-23``.  Whole texts may be formatted, such as an email
message which contains header fields followed by the message
body. Another familiar form of formatting involves visual structure,
such as tabular format and bulleted lists.

Finally, texts may contain explicit "markup", such as
``<abbrev>Phil</abbrev>``, which provides information about the
interpretation or presentation of some piece of text.  To summarize,
in language processing, strings are ubiquitous, and they often contain
important structure.

So far we have seen elementary examples of pattern matching, the
matching of individual characters.  More often we are interested in
matching *sequences* of characters.  For example, part of the
operation of a naive spell-checker could be to remove a word-final
``s`` from a suspect word token, in case the word is a plural, and see
if the putative singular form exists in the dictionary.  For this we
must locate ``s`` and remove it, but only if it precedes a word
boundary.  This requires matching a pattern consisting of two
characters.

Beyond this pattern matching on the *content* of a text, we often want
to process the *formatting* and *markup* of a text.  We may want to
check the formatting of a document (e.g. to ensure that every sentence
begins with a capital letter) or to reformat a document
(e.g. replacing sequences of space characters with a single space).
We may want to find all date strings and extract the year.  We may
want to extract all words contained inside the ``<abbrev> </abbrev>``
markup in order to construct a list of abbreviations.

Processing the content, format and markup of strings is a central task
in most kinds of NLP.  The most widespread method for string
processing uses *regular expressions*.
    
--------------------------
Simple Regular Expressions
--------------------------

In this section we will see the building blocks for simple regular
expressions, along with a selection of linguistic examples. We can
think of a regular expression as *a specialised notation for
describing patterns that we want to match*. In order to make explicit
when we are talking about a pattern *patt*, we will
use the notation |ulcorn| ``patt`` |drcorn| . The first thing to say
about regular expressions is that most letters match themselves. For
example, the pattern |ulcorn| ``sing`` |drcorn| exactly matches the
string ``sing``. In addition, regular expressions provide us with a
set of *special characters* [#]_ which give us a way to match *sets of
strings*, and we will now look at these.

.. [#] These are often called *metacharacters*; that is,
       characters which express properties of (ordinary) characters.

The Wildcard
------------

The "``.``" symbol is called a *wildcard*: it matches any single
character. For example, the regular expression
|ulcorn| ``s.ng`` |drcorn| matches the following English words:
``sang``, ``sing``, ``song``, and ``sung``. Note that
|ulcorn| ``.`` |drcorn| will match not only alphabetic characters, but
also numeric and whitespace characters. Consequently,
|ulcorn| ``s.ng`` |drcorn| will also match non-words such as ``s3ng``.

We can also use the wildcard symbol for counting characters. For
instance |ulcorn| ``....zy`` |drcorn| matches six-letter strings that
end in ``zy``.  The pattern |ulcorn| ``....berry`` |drcorn| finds words
like ``cranberry``. In our text from Wall Street Journal below, the
pattern |ulcorn| ``t...`` |drcorn| will match the words ``that`` and
``term``, and will also match the word sequence ``to a`` (since the
third "``.``" in the pattern can match the space character)::

  Paragraph 12 from wsj_0034:
  It's probably worth paying a premium for funds that invest in markets
  that are partially closed to foreign investors, such as South Korea,
  some specialists say.  But some European funds recently have
  skyrocketed; Spain Fund has surged to a startling 120% premium.  It has
  been targeted by Japanese investors as a good long-term play tied to
  1992's European economic integration.  And several new funds that aren't
  even fully invested yet have jumped to trade at big premiums.

  "I'm very alarmed to see these rich valuations," says Smith Barney's
  Mr. Porter.

.. Note:: Note that |ulcorn| ``.`` |drcorn| matches *exactly* one
   character, and must be repeated for as many characters as should be
   matched.  To match a variable number of characters we must use
   notation for *optionality*.

Note that we can see exactly where a regular expression matches
against a string using NLTK's ``re_show`` function.  Readers are
encouraged to use ``re_show`` to explore the behaviour of regular
expressions.

  >>> from nltk_lite.utilities import re_show
  >>> string = """
  ... It's probably worth paying a premium for funds that invest in markets
  ... that are partially closed to foreign investors, such as South Korea, ...
  ... """
  >>> re_show('t...', string)
  I{t's }probably wor{th p}aying a premium for funds {that} inves{t in} markets
  {that} are par{tial}ly closed {to f}oreign inves{tors}, such as Sou{th K}orea, ...

Optionality
-----------

The "``?``" symbol indicates that the immediately preceding regular
expression is optional.  The regular expression
|ulcorn| ``colou?r`` |drcorn| matches both British and American
spellings, ``colour`` and ``color``.  The expression that precedes the
``?`` may be punctuation, such as an optional hyphen.  For instance
|ulcorn| ``e-?mail`` |drcorn| matches both ``e-mail`` and ``email``.
      
Repeatability
-------------

The "``+``" symbol indicates that the immediately preceding expression
is repeatable, up to an arbitrary number of times.  For example, the
regular expression |ulcorn| ``coo+l`` |drcorn| matches ``cool``,
``coool``, and so on.  This symbol is particularly effective when
combined with the ``.`` symbol.  For example, |ulcorn| ``f.+f`` |drcorn|
matches all strings of length greater than two, that begin and end
with the letter ``f`` (e.g.  ``foolproof``).  The expression
|ulcorn| ``.+ed`` |drcorn| finds strings that potentially have the
past-tense ``-ed`` suffix.
      
The "``*``" symbol indicates that the immediately preceding expression
is both optional and repeatable. For example
|ulcorn| ``.*gnt.*`` |drcorn| matches all strings that contain ``gnt``.
      
Choices
-------

Patterns using the wildcard symbol are very effective, but there are
many instances where we want to limit the set of characters that the
wildcard can match.  In such cases we can use the ``[]`` notation,
which enumerates the set of characters to be matched &mdash; this is
called a *character class*.  For example, we can match any English
vowel, but no consonant, using |ulcorn| ``[aeiou]`` |drcorn| . Note that
this pattern can be interpreted as saying "match ``a`` or ``e`` or
&hellip; or ``u``"; that is, the pattern resembles the wildcard
pattern |ulcorn| ``.`` |drcorn| in only matching a string of length one;
unlike the wildcard, it restricts the characters matched to a specific
class (in this case, the vowels).  Note that the order of vowels in
the regular expression is insignificant, and we would have had the
same result with the expression |ulcorn| ``[uoiea]`` |drcorn| . As a
second example, the expression |ulcorn| ``p[aeiou]t`` |drcorn| matches
the words: ``pat``, ``pet``, ``pit``, ``pot``, and ``put``.

We can combine the ``[]`` notation with our notation for
repeatability.  For example, expression |ulcorn| ``p[aeiou]+t`` |drcorn|
matches the words listed above, along with: ``peat``, ``poet``, and
``pout``.

Often the choices we want to describe cannot be expressed at the level
of individual characters.  As we will see in [xref to tagging
chapter], different parts of speech are often *tagged* using labels
from a tagset. In the Brown tagset, for example, singular nouns have
the tag ``NN1``, while plural nouns have the tag ``NN2``, while nouns
which are unspecified for number (e.g., ``aircraft``) are tagged
``NN0``. So we might use |ulcorn| ``NN.*`` |drcorn| as a pattern which
will match any nominal tag. Now, suppose we were processing the output
of a tagger to extract string of tokens corresponding to noun phrases,
we might want to find all nouns (``NN.*``), adjectives (``JJ.*``),
determiners (``DT``) and cardinals (``CD``), while excluding all other
word types (e.g. verbs ``VB.*``).  It is possible, using a single
regular expression, to search for this set of candidates using the
*choice operator* `` | `` as follows:
|ulcorn| ``NN.*|JJ.*|DT|CD`` |drcorn| . This says: match ``NN.*`` *or*
``JJ.*`` *or* ``DT`` *or* ``CD``.
 
As another example of multi-character choices, suppose that we wanted
to create a program to simplify English prose, replacing rare words
(like ``habitation``) with a more frequent, synonymous word (like
``home``).  In this situation, we need to map from a potentially large
set of words to an individual word.  We can match the set of words
using the choice operator.  In the case of the word ``home``, we would
want to match the regular expression
|ulcorn| ``dwelling|domicile|abode|habitation`` |drcorn| .

.. Note:: Note that the choice operator has wide scope, so that
   |ulcorn| ``abc|def`` |drcorn| is a choice between ``abd`` and ``def``,
   and not between ``abced`` and ``abdef``.  The latter choice must be
   written using parentheses: |ulcorn| ``ab(c|d)ed`` |drcorn| .


--------------------------------
More Complex Regular Expressions
--------------------------------

In this section we will cover operators which can be used to
construct more powerful and useful regular expressions.

Ranges
------

Earlier we saw how the ``[]`` notation could be used to express a set
of choices between individual characters.  Instead of listing each
character, it is also possible to express a *range* of characters,
using the ``-`` operator.  For example, |ulcorn| ``[a-z]`` |drcorn|
matches any lowercase letter.  This allows us to avoid the
overpermissive matching we noted above with the pattern
|ulcorn| ``t...`` |drcorn| . If we were to use the pattern
|ulcorn| ``t[a-z][a-z][a-z]`` |drcorn|, then we would no longer match
the two word sequence ``to a``.

As expected, ranges can be combined with other operators. For example
|ulcorn| ``[A-Z][a-z]*`` |drcorn| matches words that have an initial
capital letter followed by any number of lowercase letters.  The
pattern |ulcorn| ``20[0-4][0-9]`` |drcorn| matches year expressions in
the range 2000 to 2049.
  
Ranges can be combined, e.g.  |ulcorn| ``[a-zA-Z]`` |drcorn| which
matches any lowercase or uppercase letter.  The expression
|ulcorn| ``[b-df-hj-np-tv-z]+`` |drcorn| matches words consisting only
of consonants (e.g. ``pygmy``).
  
Complementation
---------------

We just saw that the character class
|ulcorn| ``[b-df-hj-np-tv-z]`` |drcorn| allows us to match
consonants. However, this expression is quite cumbersome. A better
alternative is to say: let's match anything which isn't a vowel. To do
this, we need a way of expressing *complementation*.

.. Note:: Complementation is a notion drawn from set theory.  Let's
   assume that our domain of all objects is the set *U* = {a, b, c,
   d, e}, and let *V* be the set {a, e}. Then the
   complement of *V*, often written *V*&apos; is the result of
   "subtracting" *V* from *U*; i.e., the set *V*&apos; = {b, c, d}

We do this using the symbol "``^``" as the first character within the
class expression ``[]``. Let's look at an example.
|ulcorn| ``[^aeiou]`` |drcorn| is just like our earlier character class,
except now the set of vowels is preceded by ``^``. The expression as a
whole is interpreted as matching anything which *fails* to match
|ulcorn| ``[aeiou]`` |drcorn| . In other words, it matches all lowercase
consonants (plus all uppercase letters and non-alphabetic characters).

As another example, suppose we want to match any string which is
enclosed by the HTML tags for boldface, namely ``<B>`` and ``</B>``.
We might try something like this: |ulcorn| ``<B>.*</B>`` |drcorn| . This
would successfully match ``<B>important</B>``, but would also match
``<B>important</B> and <B>urgent</B>``, since the
|ulcorn| ``.*`` |drcorn| subpattern will happily match all the
characters from the end of ``important`` to the end of ``urgent``. One
way of ensuring that we only look at matched pairs of tags would be to
use the expression |ulcorn| ``<B>[^<]*</B>`` |drcorn| , where the
chararacter class matches anything other than a left angle bracket.

Finally, note that character class complementation also works with
ranges. Thus |ulcorn| ``[^a-z]`` |drcorn| matches anything other than
the lower case alphabetic characters ``a`` through ``z``.

Common Special Symbols
----------------------

So far, we have only looked at patterns which match with the content
of character strings. However, it is also useful to be able to refer
to formatting properties of texts. Two important symbols in this
regard are "``^``" and "``$``" which are used to *anchor* matches to
the beginnings or ends of lines in a file.

.. Note:: "``^``" has two quite distinct uses: it is interpreted as
   complementation when it occurs as the first symbol within a character
   class, and as matching the beginning of lines when it occurs elsewhere
   in a pattern.

For example, suppose we wanted to find all the words that occur at the
beginning of lines in the WSJ text above. Our first attempt might look
like |ulcorn| ``^[A-Za-z]+ `` |drcorn| . This says: starting at the
beginning of a line, look for one or more alphabetic characters (upper
or lower case), followed by a space. This will match the words
``that``, ``some``, ``been``, and ``even``. However, it fails to match
``It's``, since ``'`` isn't an alphabetic character. A second attempt
might be |ulcorn| ``^[^ ]+ `` |drcorn| , which says to match any string
starting at the beginning of a line, followed by one or more
characters which are *not* the space character, followed by a
space. This matches all the previous words, together with ``It's``,
``skyrocketed``, ``1992s``, ``I'm`` and ``"Mr.``. As a second example,
|ulcorn| `` [a-z]*s$`` |drcorn| will match words ending in ``s`` that
occur at the end of a line. Finally, consider the pattern
|ulcorn| ``^$`` |drcorn| ; this matches strings where no character occurs
between the beginning and the end of a line &mdash; in other words,
empty lines!

As we have seen, special characters like "``.``", "``*``", "``+``" and
"``$``" give us powerful means to generalise over character
strings. But suppose we wanted to match against a string which itself
contains one or more special characters? An example would be the
arithmetic statement ``$5.00 * ($3.05 + $0.85)``. In this case, we
need to resort to the so-called *escape* character "``\``"
("backslash"). For example, to match a dollar amount, we might use
|ulcorn| ``\$[1-9][0-9]*\.[0-9][0-9]`` |drcorn| .

----------------
Python Interface
----------------

The Python ``re`` module provides a convenient interface to an
underlying regular expression engine. The module allows a regular
expression pattern to be compiled into a object whose methods can then
be called.

In the next example, we assume that we have a local copy (i.e.,
``words``) of the Unix dictionary, which may be found in the NLTK
``data/words`` directory.  This file contains over 400,000 words, one
per line.

  >>> from re import * 
  >>> from nltk.corpus import words            # NB not NLTK_LITE yet

Next we read in the list of words and count them:

  >>> w = words.open('words').read()
  >>> len(w)
  408865

Now we can compile a regular expression for words containing a sequence of two 'a's
and find the matches:

  >>> r1 = compile('.*aa.*') 
  >>> print r1.findall(w)
  ['Afrikaans', 'bazaar', 'bazaars', 'Canaan', 'Haag', 'Haas', 'Isaac', 'Isaacs', 'Isaacson', 'Izaak', 'Salaam', 'Transvaal', 'Waals']

Suppose now that we want to find all three-letter words ending in the
letter "``c``". Our first attempt might be as follows:

  >>> r1 = compile('..c') 
  >>> print r1.findall(w)[:10]
  ['bac', 'duc', 'duc', 'duc', 'duc', 'duc', 'duc', 'duc', 'anc', 'jec']

The problem is that we have matched three-letter sequences ending in
"``c``" which occur *anywhere within a word*. For example, the pattern
will match "``c``" in words like ``aback``, ``Aerobacter`` and
``albacore``. Inspection of the file ``words`` reveals that words are
listed one to a line. So we might want to revise our pattern so that
the match string is anchored to the beginning and ends of the line:
|ulcorn| ``^...$`` |drcorn| . However, the ``words`` is read into Python
as a single string (containing line breaks), and the Python ``re``
module interprets |ulcorn| ``^`` |drcorn| as matching only only at the
beginning of the string as a whole; i.e., in this case, the pattern
would only try to match against the first word of the file. To deal
with this, we use the *compilation flag* ``MULTILINE`` which makes
|ulcorn| ``^`` |drcorn| also match at the beginning of each line with a
string:

  >>> r2 = compile('^..c$',MULTILINE)
  >>> print r2.findall(w)
  ['arc', 'Doc', 'Lac', 'Mac', 'Vic']

In the section on complementation, we briefly looked at the task of
matching strings which were enclosed by HTML markup. Our first attempt
is illustrated in the following code example, where we incorrectly
match the whole string, rather than just the substring
"``<B>important</B>``".

  >>> html = '<B>important</B> and <B>urgent</B>'
  >>> r2 = compile('<B>.*</B>')
  >>> print r2.findall(html)
  ['<B>important</B> and <B>urgent</B>']

As we pointed out, one solution is to use a character class which
matches with the complement of "``<``":

  >>> r4 = compile('<B>[^<]*</B>')
  >>> print r4.findall(html)
  ['<B>important</B>', '<B>urgent</B>']

However, there is another way of approaching this problem.
|ulcorn| ``<B>.*</B>`` |drcorn| gets the wrong results because the
|ulcorn| ``*`` |drcorn| operator tries to consume as much input as
possible. That is, the matching is said to be *greedy*. In the current
case, |ulcorn| ``*`` |drcorn| matches everything after the first
``<B>``, including the following ``</B>`` and ``<B>``.  If we instead
use the non-greedy star operator |ulcorn| ``*?`` |drcorn| , we get the
desired match, since |ulcorn| ``*?`` |drcorn| tries to consume as little
input as possible.
