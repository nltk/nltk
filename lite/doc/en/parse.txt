Introduction 
------------

Early experiences with grammar are often confusing.  Written work
may be graded by a teacher who red-lines all the grammar errors they
won't put up with.  Like the dangling preposition in the last
sentence, or sentences like this one which lack a main verb.  Learning
English as a second language, it may be difficult to discover
which of these errors needs to be fixed.  Correct punctuation is
something of an obsession for many writers and editors (as our own
students have observed).  Of course, it is all in the name of
effective communication.  In the following example, the interpretation
of a relative clause as restrictive or non-restrictive, depends on the
presence of commas alone:

1. a) My dog, Bonus, has black and white spots.  (I have one dog.)
   b) My dog Bonus has black and white spots.  (I have more than one dog.)

It is clear that some of these rules are important, while others seem
to be vestiges of antiquated style that preoccupies only the most crusty
curmudgeons (or over-eager grammar checkers included in some word
processors).  However, it is *not* clear where to draw the line
between the two, hence the confusion noted above.

When reading, we sometimes find that we have to stop and re-read a
sentence in order to resolve an ambiguity.  Curiously, it seems possible
to combine unambiguous words to create an ambiguous sentences:

2. a) Fighting animals could be dangerous.
   b) Visiting relatives can be tiresome.

Perhaps another kind of variation, word order, is easier to understand.
We know that the two sentences *Kim likes Sandy* and *Sandy likes Kim*
have different meanings, and that *likes Sandy Kim* is simply ungrammatical.
Similarly, we know that the following two sentences are equivalent:

3. a) The farmer *loaded* the cart with sand
   b) The farmer *loaded* sand into the cart

However, consider the semantically similar verbs *filled* and *dumped*.
Now the word order cannot be altered (ungrammatical sentences are starred.)

4. a) The farmer *filled* the cart with sand
   b) \*The farmer *filled* sand into the cart
   c) \*The farmer *dumped* the cart with sand
   d) The farmer *dumped* sand into the cart

A further curious fact is that we are able to access the meaning of
sentences we have not encountered.  It is not difficult to concoct an
entirely novel sentence, one that has probably never been used before
in the history of the language, and yet all speakers of the language
will agree about its meaning.  In fact, the set of possible sentences would
seem to be infinite, given that there is no upper bound on length.
Consider the following passage from a children's story, containing a
rather impressive sentence:

   You can imagine Piglet's joy when at last the ship came in sight of
   him. In after-years he liked to think that he had been in Very
   Great Danger during the Terrible Flood, but the only danger he had
   really been in was the last half-hour of his imprisonment, when
   Owl, who had just flown up, sat on a branch of his tree to comfort
   him, and told him a very long story about an aunt who had once laid
   a seagull's egg by mistake, and the story went on and on, rather
   like this sentence, until Piglet who was listening out of his
   window without much hope, went to sleep quietly and naturally,
   slipping slowly out of the window towards the water until he was
   only hanging on by his toes, at which moment, luckily, a sudden
   loud squawk from Owl, which was really part of the story, being
   what his aunt said, woke the Piglet up and just gave him time to
   jerk himself back into safety and say, "How interesting, and did
   she?"  when -- well, you can imagine his joy when at last he saw
   the good ship, Brain of Pooh (Captain, C. Robin; 1st Mate, P. Bear)
   coming over the sea to rescue him...  (from A.A. Milne *In which
   Piglet is Entirely Surrounded by Water*)

This chapter presents grammars and parsing, as the formal and
computational methods for investigating and modelling the linguistic
phenomena we have been touch on (or which have been tripping us over).

As before, the motivation is natural language *understanding*.  How
much more of the meaning of a text can we access when we can reliably
recognize the linguistic structures it contains?  Having read in a
text, can a program 'understand' it enough to be able to answer simple
questions about "what happened?" or "who did what to whom?"  Also as
before, we will develop simple programs to process annotated corpora
and perform useful tasks.

Before reviewing the linguistic fundamentals, we take a closer
look at the ambiguity problem mentioned above.

Motivational problem: PP attachment

Exercises?

------------------------
Bits of Old Introduction
------------------------

As we shall see, patterns of well-formedness and ill-formedness in a
sequence of words can be understood with respect to the internal
:glossterm:`phrase structure` of the sentences.  We can develop formal
models of these structures using grammars and parsers.

In the context of formal and computational modelling, a language is
often viewed as a set of well-formed sentences.  Sequences of words
which are not grammatical are excluded from this set.  Now, since
there is no upper-bound on the length of a sentence, the number of
possible sentences is unbounded.

Given that the resources of a computer, however large, are still
finite, it is necessary to devise a finite description of this
infinite set.  Such descriptions are called
:glossterm:`grammars`. That is, a grammar of a language is a means of
specifying which strings belong to the language, and as we have just
remarked, it needs to be a finite specification (rather than, say,
just a list of all the grammatical sentences). We have already
encountered this idea of a finite specification in the context of
regular expressions.  For example, the expression ``a+`` describes the
infinite set ``{a, aa, aaa, aaaa, ...}``.  Apart from their
compactness, grammars usually capture important structural and
distributional properties of the language being studied, and can be
used to systematically map between sequences of words and abstract
representations of their meaning.  Thus, even if we were to impose an
upper bound on sentence length to ensure the language was finite, we
would still want to come up with a compact representation in the form
of a grammar.

Constituency
------------

A well-formed sentence of a language is more than an arbitrary
sequence of words from the language.  Certain kinds of words usually
go together.  For instance, determiners like ``the`` are typically
followed by adjectives or nouns, but not by verbs.  Groups of words
form intermediate structures called phrases or :glossterm:`constituents`.
These constituents can be identified using standard syntactic tests,
such as substitution, movement and coordination.  For example, if a
sequence of words can be replaced with a pronoun, then that sequence
is likely to be a constituent.  According to this test, we can infer
that the italicised string in the following example is a constituent:


1. *Ordinary daily multivitamin and mineral supplements* could 
   help adults with diabetes fight off some minor infections.
#. *They* could help adults with diabetes fight off some minor infections.

.. note:: Readers are referred to any introductory text on syntax for
   fuller treatment of constituency, e.g. McCawley (1998) The Syntactic
   Phenomena of English.

The structure of a sentence may be represented using a phrase
structure tree, in which the terminal symbols are the words of the
sentence, the pre-terminal symbols are parts of speech, and the
remaining non-terminals are syntactic constituents.  An example of
such a tree is shown below. For those trained in
theoretical linguistics, the lexical categories (i.e., the nonterminal
symbols immediately dominating the words of the tree) may appear
strange.  This is because we have used used labels drawn from the
Brown Corpus part-of-speech tag set (please see the chapter on tagging
for discussion).

   _`Example Tree 1`

A grammar is a formal system which specifies which sequences of words
are well-formed in the language, and which provides one or more phrase
structures for the sequence.  We will focus our attention on a
particular kind of grammar called a :glossterm:`context-free grammar`
(CFG), which is a collection of rules or *productions* of the form
``S`` |rarr| ``NP VP``.  We interpret this production as saying that a
constituent of category ``S`` can consist of subconstituents of
categories ``NP`` and ``VP``. Similarly, the production ``VB`` |rarr|
``'help'`` means that the constituent of category ``VB`` can consist
of the string ``help``.  For a phrase structure tree to be well-formed
relative to a grammar, each non-terminal node and its children must
correspond to such a production in the grammar.

A :glossterm:`parser` is a computational system which processes input sentences
according to the productions of a grammar, and builds one or more
constituent structures which conform to the grammar. While a
grammar is a declarative specification of well-formedness,  a
parser is a procedural interpretation of the grammar.  In this
chapter we will present context-free grammars, and describe some
simple parsers that work with them.


..  EXPAND THE ABOVE DISCUSSION 

Parsing is important in linguistics and natural language processing
for a variety of reasons.  A parser permits a grammar to be evaluated
against a potentially large collection of test sentences, helping the
linguist to identify shortcomings in their analysis.  A parser can
also be used as a model of psycholinguistic processing, with the goal
of explaining the processing difficulties that humans have with
certain syntactic constructions (e.g., the so-called "garden path"
sentences).  There are many NL applications which involve parsing at
some point; for example, we would expect the natural language input to
a question-answering system to undergo parsing as an initial step.

Phrase Structure Trees
----------------------

As we saw above, linguistic structure is typically represented using
in terms of tree, and we take this opportunity to briefly go over some
concepts and terminology. Consider the following example:

.. figure:: ../images.parsing/trees_tree.png

Abstractly, the tree is a set of connected nodes, each of which is labeled with a category.
We note that linguistic trees grow upside down: the
node labeled ``S`` is the *root* of the tree, while the *leaves* of the
tree are labeled with the words 'Lee', 'saw', 'the' and 'dog'. It also
common to use
a family metaphor to talk about the relationships of nodes in a tree: for example, ``S`` is the
*mother* of ``VP``, while conversely ``VP`` is a *daughter*  (or child) of
``S``. Moreover, since ``NP`` and ``VP`` are both daughters of ``S``,
they are also *sisters*. 

Although it is helpful to represent trees in a graphical format, for
computational purposes we usually need a more text-oriented
representation. One standard method is to use a combination of bracket
and labels to indicate the structure, as shown here::

   (S 
       (NP  'Lee')
       (VP 
             (V 'saw')
             (NP 
                   (Det 'the')
                   (N  'dog'))))

As we will see later, NLTK-Lite employs a similar approach for printing out
trees.

Structural Ambiguity
--------------------

Let's start off by looking at a simple context-free grammar, `G1`_:


_`G1`
 | S |rarr| NP VP
 | NP |rarr| Det N
 | NP |rarr| Det N PP
 | VP |rarr| V NP PP
 | VP |rarr| V NP
 | VP |rarr| V
 | PP |rarr| P NP
 |
 | Det |rarr| 'the'
 | Det |rarr| 'a'
 | N |rarr| 'man' | 'park' | 'dog' | 'telescope'
 | V |rarr| 'saw' | 'walked'
 | P |rarr| 'in' | 'with'

The productions are presented in two groups which we will call
:glossterm:`grammatical productions` and :glossterm:`lexical
productions` respectively.  The labels in the grammatical productions
(e.g., ``S``, ``NP``, ``VP``, ``Det``, etc) are all :glossterm:`nonterminal
symbols`, as are the labels on the lefthand side of the lexical
productions.  Nonterminal symbols correspond to the grammatical
categories we use to label constituents.  By contrast,
:glossterm:`terminal symbols` are what we call the words (e.g., `the`,
`a`, `man` and so on) whose syntactic behaviour is defined by the
grammar. Sometimes we also refer to these words as
:glossterm:`lexical items`; these are the strings which will be
listed in a lexicon.

Notice that in the lexical productions, we have used
disjunction '``|``' on the righthand side of the productions as an
abbreviatory device. For example, ``P`` |rarr| ``'in' | 'with'`` means
that a ``P`` (preposition) can be realized as either `in` or
`with`.

The categories ``S``, ``NP``, ``VP`` and ``PP`` on the righthand side of the
grammatical productions in `G1`_ are sometimes called
:glossterm:`phrasal categories`. The remaining categories, ``Det``,
``N``, ``V`` and ``P`` are :glossterm:`lexical categories`, in that they introduce
lexical items. 

======    ====================    =====================
Part of Speech Categories
-------------------------------------------------------
Symbol    Meaning                 Example
======    ====================    =====================
S         sentence                *the man walked*
NP        noun phrase 		  *a dog*
VP        verb phrase 		  *saw a park*
PP        prepositional phrase 	  *with a telescope*
..	  ..                      ..
Det       determiner              ..
N         noun                    ..
V         verb                    ..
P         preposition             ..
======    ====================    =====================


If we were to parse the string `The dog saw a man in the park` using
`G1`_, we would end up with two distinct analyses, as shown 
below:

===================  ==================
Structural Ambiguity
---------------------------------------
VP modification      NP modification
===================  ==================
|parse_tree2|        |parse_tree3|
===================  ==================

.. |parse_tree2| image:: ../images.parsing/parse_tree2.png
.. |parse_tree3| image:: ../images.parsing/parse_tree3.png


The fact that our grammar admits two distinct structures for this
sentence indicates that the sentence is :glossterm:`structurally ambiguous`.
The ambiguity in question is often called a :glossterm:`PP attachment
ambiguity`, since the issue at hand is how the ``PP`` (prepositional
phrase) `in the park` should be attached to the phrase structure
tree. In this case, we can see that the grammar admits just two
choices. The ``PP`` is attached either as a daughter of ``VP`` or else
as a daughter of ``NP``. 

There is also a difference in semantic interpretation associated with
the two structures, though the meaning distinction is somewhat subtle
in this case. Where the ``PP`` is attached to ``VP``, the intended
interpretation is that the event of seeing took place in the park,
while if the ``PP`` is attached to ``NP``, being in the park is a
property of the ``NP`` referent; that is, the man was in the park, but
the agent of the seeing |mdash| the dog |mdash| might have somewhere
else (e.g., sitting on the balcony of an apartment overlooking the
park).  As we will see, dealing with ambiguity is a key challenge in
parsing.

Prepositional Phrase Attachment Corpus
--------------------------------------

The *Prepositional Phrase Attachment Corpus*, included with NLTK-Lite,
facilitates systematic study of the attachment of prepositional phrases.
It contains lines of the following form::

  47830 allow visits between families N
  47830 allow visits on peninsula V
  47828 announced reduction in formalities N
  46487 announced plan in September V
  42457 acquired interest in firm N
  42457 acquired interest in 1986 V

Each line consists of a sentence identifier, a verb, a noun, a
preposition, another noun (the head noun from the prepositional
phrase), and finally an "attachment" (``N`` or ``V``) to indicate
whether the prepositional phrase attaches to the noun phrase or the
verb phrase.  The above examples correspond to the following tree
fragments:

  | (VP allow (NP visits (PP between families)))
  | (VP allow (NP visits) (PP on peninsula))
  | (VP announced (NP reduction (PP in formalities))
  | (VP announced (NP plan) (PP in September))
  | (VP acquired (NP interest (PP in firm)))
  | (VP acquired (NP interest) (PP in 1986))

We can access the PP Attachment Corpus as follows:

  >>> from nltk_lite.corpora import ppattach
  >>> from pprint import pprint
  >>> from itertools import islice
  >>> pprint(list(islice(ppattach.raw('training'), 0, 5)))
  [('0', 'join', 'board', 'as', 'director', 'V'),
   ('1', 'is', 'chairman', 'of', 'N.V.', 'N'),
   ('2', 'named', 'director', 'of', 'conglomerate', 'N'),
   ('3', 'caused', 'percentage', 'of', 'deaths', 'N'),
   ('5', 'using', 'crocidolite', 'in', 'filters', 'V')]

There is also a ``dictionary()`` method which may be more convenient
in some cases, e.g.:

  >>> from nltk_lite.corpora import extract
  >>> item = extract(2, ppattach.dictionary('training'))
  >>> pprint(item)
  {'attachment': 'N',
   'noun1': 'director',
   'noun2': 'conglomerate',
   'prep': 'of',
   'sent': '2',
   'verb': 'named'}

Recursion
---------

We remarked earlier that there is no upper bound on the length of
sentences of a natural language. Within context-free grammars, the
main mechanism which allows this unboundedness is :glossterm:`recursion`. A
grammar is said to be :glossterm:`recursive` if a category occurring on the
lefthand side of a production also appears on the righthand side of a
production. If this dual occurrence takes place in *one and the same
production*, then we have :glossterm:`direct recursion`; otherwise we have
:glossterm:`indirect recursion`. These two cases are both illustrated in the
following grammar:

_`G2`
 | S  |rarr| NP VP
 | NP |rarr| Det N
 | NP |rarr| Det N PP
 | VP |rarr| VP Conj VP
 | VP |rarr| V NP PP
 | VP |rarr| V NP
 | VP |rarr| V S
 | VP |rarr| V
 | PP |rarr| P NP
 |
 | Det |rarr| 'the'
 | Det |rarr| 'a'
 | N |rarr| 'man' | 'woman' | 'park' | 'dog' | 'telescope'
 | V |rarr| 'saw' | 'barked' | 'disappeared' | 'said' | 'gave'
 | P |rarr| 'in' | 'with' | 'to'
 | Conj |rarr| 'and' | 'or'

That is, the production ``VP`` |rarr| ``VP Conj VP`` involves direct
recursion on the category ``VP``\, whereas indirect recursion on ``S``
arises from the combination of two productions, namely ``S`` |rarr|
``NP VP`` and ``VP`` |rarr| ``V S``.  To illustrate, here is a
phrase structure tree involving coordinated verb phrases:

.. figure:: ../images.parsing/recursive_parse1.png

   _`Figure 2:` Coordinated VP Phrase Structure Tree

The following examples illustrate how recursion on ``S`` can yield
longer and longer sentences:

#. The man said that the dog barked.
#. The man said that the woman said that the dog barked.
#. The man said that the woman said that the man said that the dog
   barked.
#. The man said that the woman said that the man said that the woman
   said ...

.. left and right recursion

Heads, Complements and Modifiers
--------------------------------

The grammar `G2`_ correctly generates examples like these,
corresponding to the four productions with ``VP`` on the lefthand side:

#. The woman gave the telescope to the dog.
#. The woman saw a man.
#. A man said that the woman disappeared.
#. The dog barked.

That is, `gave` can occur with a following ``NP`` and ``PP``; 
`saw` can occur with a following ``NP``; 
`said` can occur with a following ``S``; 
and `barked` can occur with no following phrase.
In these cases, ``NP``, ``PP`` and ``S`` are called :glossterm:`complements`
of the respective verbs, and the verbs themselves are called
:glossterm:`heads` of the verb phrase.

However, there are fairly strong constraints on what verbs can occur
with what complements. Thus, we would like our grammars to mark the
following examples as ungrammatical:
 
#. \*The woman disappeared the telescope to the dog.
#. \*The dog barked a man.
#. \*A man gave that the woman disappeared.
#. \*A man said.

.. caution:: It should be borne in mind that it is possible to create
   examples which involve "non-standard" but interpretable
   combinations of verbs and complements. Thus, we can, at a stretch,
   interpret *the man disappeared the dog* as meaning that the man
   made the dog disappear. We will ignore such examples here.

How can we ensure that our grammar correctly excludes the
ungrammatical examples above?  We need some way of constraining
grammar productions which expand ``VP`` so that verbs *only* cooccur
with their correct complements. We do this by dividing the class of
verbs into \'subcategories\', each of which is associated with a
different set of complements. For example, :glossterm:`transitive
verbs` such as `saw`, `kissed` and `hit` require a following ``NP``
object complement. Let's introduce a new label for such verbs, namely
``V_tr``, and use it in the following productions:

| VP |rarr| V_tr NP
| V_tr |rarr| 'saw' | 'kissed' | 'hit'

Now `*the dog barked the man` is excluded since we haven't listed
`barked` as a ``V_tr``, but `the woman saw a man` is still allowed.
The following table provides more examples of labels for verb subcategories.

======    ====================    =====================
Verb Subcategories
-------------------------------------------------------
Symbol    Meaning                 Example
======    ====================    =====================
V_itr     intransitive verb       *barked*
V_tr      transitive verb         *saw a man*
V_dat     dative verb             *gave a dog to a man*
V_sent    sentential verb         *said that a dog barked*
======    ====================    =====================

The revised grammar for ``VP`` will now look like this:

| VP |rarr| V_dat NP PP
| VP |rarr| V_tr NP
| VP |rarr| V_sent S
| VP |rarr| V_itr 
|
| V_dat |rarr| 'gave' | 'donated' | 'presented'
| V_tr |rarr| 'saw' | 'kissed' | 'hit' | 'sang'
| V_sent |rarr| 'said' | 'knew' | 'alleged'
| V_itr |rarr| 'barked' | 'disappeared' | 'elapsed' | 'sang'

Notice that on this approach, a given lexical item can belong to more
than one subcategory. For example, `sang` can occur both with and
without a following ``NP`` complement.

Lexical heads other than ``V`` can be subcategorized for particular complements:

*Nouns*
   #. The rumour **that Kim was bald** circulated widely.
   #. \*The picture **that Kim was bald** circulated widely.
*Adjectives*
   #. Lee was afraid **to leave**.
   #. \*Lee was tall **to leave**.

It has also been suggested that 'ordinary' prepositions are
transitive, and that many so-called adverb are in fact intransitive
prepositions. For example, *towards* requires an ``NP`` complement,
while *home* and *forwards* forbid them.


#. Lee ran towards the house.
#. \*Lee ran towards.

#. Sammy walked home.
#. \*Sammy walked home the house.

#. Brent stepped one pace forwards.
#. \*Brent stepped one pace forwards the house.

Adopting this approach, we can also analyse certain prepositions as allowing ``PP`` complements:

#. Kim ran away **from the house**.
#. Lee jumped down **into the boat**.

In general, the lexical categories ``V``, ``N``, ``A`` and ``P`` are
taken to be the heads of the respective phrases ``VP``, ``NP``,
``AP`` and ``PP``. Abstracting over the identity of these phrases, we
can say that a lexical category ``X`` is the head of its immediate
``XP`` phrase, and moreover that the complements `C`:subscript:`1` ... `C`:subscript:`n` of
``X`` will occur as sisters of ``X`` within that ``XP``. This is
illustrated in the following schema:

.. figure:: ../images.parsing/xp.png

We have argued that lexical categories need to be subdivided into
subcategories to account for the fact that different lexical items
select different sequences of following complements. That is, it is a
distinguishing property of complements that they co-occur with some
lexical items but not others. By contrast, :glossterm:`modifiers` can
occur with pretty much any instance of the relevant lexical class. For
example, consider the temporal adverbial *last Thursday*:

#. The woman gave the telescope to the dog last Thursday.
#. The woman saw a man last Thursday.
#. The dog barked last Thursday.

Moreover, modifiers are always optional, whereas complements are at
least sometimes obligatory. We can use the phrase structure
geometry to draw a structural distinction between complements, which
occur as sisters of the lexical head, versus modifiers, which occur as
sisters of the phrase which encloses the head:

Manually Constructed Grammars
-----------------------------

In this chapter, we only consider very small ('toy') context-free
grammars, in order to illustrate the key aspects of parsing such
grammars. But there is an obvious question as to whether the general
approach can be scaled up to cover large corpora of natural
languages. How hard would it be to construct such a set of rules by
hand? In general, the answer is: Very hard. Even if we allow ourselves
to use various formal devices that give much more succinct
representations of phrase structure rules (some of which will be
discussed in the next chapter), it is still extremely difficult to
keep control of the complex interactions between the many rules
required to cover the major constructions of a language. That is, it
is hard to modularize grammars, so that one portion can be worked on
independently of the other parts. This in turn means that it is
difficult to distribute the task of grammar writing across a team of
linguists. Another difficulty is that as the grammar expands to cover
a wider and wider range of constructions, there is a corresponding
increase in the number of analyses which are admitted for any one
sentence. In other words, ambiguity increases proportionally with
coverage.

.. 
 that w a broad coverage grammar
 . But we may want to ask how
 Shortcomings of this approach: unreliable, doesn't scale,
 complex interactions amongst productions makes manual debugging
 almost impossible.  Consequently linguists are unable to
 work with large-coverage grammars.-->


Despite the problems just alluded to, there are a number of
large-scale collaborative projects ongoing which appear to have
achieved interesting and often impressive results in developing
rule-based grammars for several languages. Examples are the Lexical
Functional Grammar (LFG) Pargram project
(http://www2.parc.com/istl/groups/nltt/pargram/), the Head-Driven
Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) LinGO Matrix framework
(http://www.delph-in.net/matrix/), and the Lexicalized Tree Adjoining
Grammar XTAG Project (http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~xtag/).

Computational Approaches to Parsing

 to do it)


-------------------------
Recursive Descent Parsing 
-------------------------

The simplest kind of parser interprets the grammar as a specification
of how to break a high-level goal into several lower-level subgoals.
The top-level goal is to find an ``S``.  The ``S`` |rarr| ``NP VP``
production permits the parser to replace this goal with two subgoals:
find an ``NP``, then find a ``VP``.  Each of these subgoals can be
replaced in turn by sub-sub-goals, using productions that have ``NP``
and ``VP`` on their left-hand side.  Eventually, this expansion
process leads to subgoals such as: find the word ``telescope``.  Such
subgoals can be directly compared against the input string, and
succeed if the next word is matched.  If there is no match the parser
must back up and try a different alternative.

The recursive descent parser builds a parse tree during the above
process.  With the initial goal (find an ``S``), the ``S`` root node
is created.  As the above process recursively expands its goals using
the productions of the grammar, the parse tree is extended downwards
(hence the name *recursive descent*).  We can see this in action using
the parser demonstration ``nltk_lite.draw.rdparser``.  To run this
demonstration, use the following commands::

  >> from nltk_lite.draw.rdparser import demo
  >> demo()

Six stages of the execution of this parser are shown below:

.. Discussion: choosing which of several possible productions to apply;
   backtracking; termination.

Problems with recursive descent parsing: considers structures and
words that are not attested; backtracking may discard parsed
constituents that need to be rebuilt; for example, backtracking over
``VP`` |rarr| ``V NP`` will discard the structures created for the ``V``
and ``NP`` non-terminals.  If the parser then proceeds with ``VP``
|rarr| ``V NP PP``, then the structures for the ``V`` and ``NP`` must be
created again.

Recursive descent parsing is a kind of *top-down parsing*.  These use
the grammar to *predict* what the input will be, before inspecting any
input.  However, since the input is available to the parser all along,
it would be more sensible to consider the input sentence from the very
beginning.  Such an approach is called *bottom-up parsing*, and is the
topic of the next section.


--------------------
Shift-Reduce Parsing 
--------------------

The simplest kind of bottom-up parsing is known as shift-reduce
parsing.  The parser repeatedly pushes the next input word onto a stack;
this is the *shift* operation.  If the top *n* items on the stack
match the *n* items on the right-hand side of some production, then
they are all popped off the stack, and the item on the left-hand side
of the production is pushed on the stack.  This replacement of the top
*n* items with a single item is the *reduce* operation.  The parser
finishes when all the input is consumed and there is only one item
remaining on the stack, a parse tree with an ``S`` node as its root.


.. 
 To do: add examples and motivate more - what are we doing with
 bottom up - find little pieces and expand...


.. note::
 Note that the reduce operation may only be applied to the top of the stack.
 Reducing items lower in the stack must be done before later items are pushed onto
 the stack.


The shift-reduce parser builds a parse tree during the above process.
If the top of stack holds the word ``dog`` and if the grammar has a
production ``N`` |rarr| ``dog`` then the reduce operation causes the word
to be replaced with the parse tree for this production.  For
convenience we will represent this tree as ``N(dog)``.  At a later
stage, if the top of the stack holds two items ``Det(the) N(dog)`` and
if the grammar has a production ``NP`` |rarr| ``Det N`` then the reduce
operation causes these two items to be replaced with ``NP(Det(the),
N(dog))``.  This process continues until a parse tree for the entire
sentence has been constructed.  We can see this in action using the
parser demonstration ``nltk_lite.draw.srparser``.  To run this
demonstration, use the following commands::

 from nltk_lite.draw.srparser import demo
 demo()

Six stages of the execution of this parser are shown below:

   Six Stages of a Shift-Reduce Parser: initial, after one shift,

.. image:: ../images.parsing/srparser6.png


A shift-reduce parser may fail to parse the sentence, even though the
sentence is well-formed according to the grammar.  In such cases,
there are no remaining input words to shift, and there is no way to
reduce the remaining items on the stack, as exemplified in the left
example below.  The parser entered this blind alley at an earlier
stage shown in the middle example below, when it reduced instead of
shifted.  This situation is called a *shift-reduce conflict*.  At
another possible stage of processing shown in the right example below,
the parser must choose between two possible reductions, both matching
the top items on the stack: ``V`` |rarr| ``V NP PP`` or ``NP`` |rarr|
``NP PP``.  This situation is called a *reduce-reduce conflict*.

.. To do: diagram showing search tree with success and failure.

Shift-reduce parsers may implement policies for resolving such
conflicts.  For example, they may address shift-reduce conflicts by
shifting only when no reductions are possible, and they may address
reduce-reduce conflicts by favouring the reduction operation that removes
the most items from the stack.  No such policies are failsafe however.

The advantages of shift-reduce parsers over recursive descent parsers
is that they only build structure that corresponds to the words in the
input.  Furthermore, they only build each substructure once,
e.g. ``NP(Det(the), N(man))`` is only built and pushed onto the stack
a single time, regardless of whether it will later be used by the ``V``
|rarr| ``V NP PP`` reduction or the ``NP`` |rarr| ``NP PP`` reduction.

Context Free Grammars
---------------------

The ``nltk_lite.cfg`` module defines a set of classes that are used to
define context free grammars:

1. The ``cfg.Nonterminal`` class is used to represent nonterminals.
 
#. The ``cfg.Production`` class is used to represent CFG productions.

#. The ``cfg.Grammar`` class is used to represent CFGs.

------------
Nonterminals
------------


``Nonterminal`` is a simple class that's used to let NLTK distinguish
terminals from nonterminals.  Each ``Nonterminal`` is defined by a
:glossterm:`symbol`, which is represented by a case-sensitive string.  Typical
symbols for ``Nonterminals`` are ``"S"`` (for sentence) and ``"NP"``
(for noun phrases).  To construct a ``Nonterminal``, use the
``Nonterminal`` constructor::

  >>> from nltk_lite.parse import cfg
  >>> S = cfg.Nonterminal('S')
  >>> S
  <S>
  >>> NP = cfg.Nonterminal('NP')
  >>> NP
  <NP>

..  Mention the symbol() method? -->
..  Mention division of nonterminal? -->

If you are defining many nonterminals at once, you can use the
``nonterminals()`` function.  This function takes a string containing
a list of symbol names, and returns a list of ``Nonterminals``
constructed from those symbol names::

  >>> VP, Adj, V, N = cfg.nonterminals('VP, Adj, V, N')
  >>> VP, Adj, V, N
  (<VP>, <Adj>, <V>, <N>)

When using the ``nonterminals()`` function, you should be always be
careful to make sure that the order of the variables you define
matches the order of the nonterminals in the string.

-----------
Productions
-----------

CFG productions are represented with the ``cfg.Production`` class.
Each ``Production`` specifies that a nonterminal (the :glossterm:`left-hand
side`) can be expanded to a sequence of terminals and nonterminals
(the :glossterm:`right-hand side`).  Productions are created with the
``cfg.Production`` constructor, which takes a nonterminal left-hand
side, and zero or more terminals and nonterminals for the right-hand
side::

  >>> prod1 = cfg.Production(S, [NP, VP])
  >>> prod1
  S -> NP VP
  >>> prod2 = cfg.Production(NP, ['the', Adj, N])
  >>> prod2
  NP -> 'the' Adj N

The right-hand side may contain any number of elements.  In
particular, for so-called :glossterm:`epsilon productions`, the right-hand side
is empty.  When parsing natural language, epsilon productions are
often used for :glossterm:`traces`, which mark the position from which a
constituent moved::

  >>> trace = cfg.Nonterminal('t')
  >>> trace
  <t>

  >>> prod3 = cfg.Production(trace, [])
  >>> prod3
  t ->

----
CFGs
----

Context free grammars are encoded by the ``Grammar`` class.  A ``Grammar``
consists of a special :glossterm:`start` nonterminal, and an ordered list of
productions.  ``Grammars`` are created with the constructor::

  >>> grammar = cfg.Grammar(S, [prod1, prod2, prod3])
  >>> grammar
  <Grammar with 3 productions>

A grammar's start state is returned by the ``start`` method; and its list
of productions is returned by the ``productions`` method::

  >>> grammar.start()
  <S>
  >>> grammar.productions()
  (S -> NP VP, NP -> 'the' Adj N, t ->)

A complete example of a toy grammar is given below::

  >>> from nltk_lite.parse import cfg
  >>> S, VP, NP, PP = cfg.nonterminals('S, VP, NP, PP')
  >>> V, N, P, Name, Det = cfg.nonterminals('V, N, P, Name, Det')
  >>> productions = (
  ...     cfg.Production(S, [NP, VP]),
  ...     cfg.Production(NP, [Det, N]),
  ...     cfg.Production(VP, [V, NP]),
  ...     cfg.Production(VP, [V, NP, PP]),
  ...     cfg.Production(NP, [Det, N, PP]),
  ...     cfg.Production(PP, [P, NP]),
  ...     cfg.Production(NP, ['I']),   cfg.Production(Det, ['the']),
  ...     cfg.Production(Det, ['a']),  cfg.Production(N, ['man']),
  ...     cfg.Production(V, ['saw']),  cfg.Production(P, ['in']),
  ...     cfg.Production(P, ['with']), cfg.Production(N, ['park']),
  ...     cfg.Production(N, ['dog']),  cfg.Production(N, ['telescope'])
  ... )
  >>> grammar = cfg.Grammar(S, productions)


.. Note:: All of the grammars shown here use atomic non-terminal
   symbols, e.g. ``VP``.  For extensions that support feature-based
   grammars and parsers, please refer to the
   ``nltk_contrib.mit.rspeer.parser`` module.

NLTK-Lite also supports a more compact and convenient format for reading
grammars, using the ``cfg.parse_grammar()`` method::

  >>> from nltk_lite.parse import cfg
  >>> grammar2 = cfg.parse_grammar('''
  ...   S -> NP VP
  ...   VP -> V NP | V NP PP
  ...   V -> "saw" | "ate"
  ...   NP -> "John" | "Mary" | "Bob" | Det N | Det N PP
  ...   Det -> "a" | "an" | "the" | "my"
  ...   N -> "dog" | "cat" | "cookie"
  ...   PP -> P NP
  ...   P -> "on" | "by" | "with"
  ...   ''')

  >>> from nltk_lite import tokenize, parse
  >>> sent = list(tokenize.whitespace("Mary saw Bob"))
  >>> rd_parser = parse.RecursiveDescent(grammar2)
  >>> for p in rd_parser.get_parse_list(sent):
  ...      print p
  (S: (NP: 'Mary') (VP: (V: 'saw') (NP: 'Bob')))
  
-----
Trees 
-----

The ``nltk_lite.tree`` module defines classes and functions for
working with trees.

.. Note:: The ``nltk_lite.tree`` module currently has no direct
   support for representing movement, traces, and co-indexing.  We plan
   to extend the class to support these features more fully in the
   future.

1.  The node value is a string containing
    the tree's constituent type (e.g., ``NP`` or ``VP``).
#.  The children encode the hierarchical contents of the tree.

.. Note:: Although the ``Tree`` class is usually used for encoding
   syntax trees, it can be used to encode *any* homogeneous hierarchical
   structure that spans a text (such as morphological structure or
   discourse structure).  In the general case, leaves and node values do
   not have to be strings.

A ``Tree`` with node value
`n` and children
`c`:subscript:`1`,
`c`:subscript:`2`, ...
`c`:subscript:`n` is
written ``(n``:
`c`:subscript:`1`
`c`:subscript:`2` ...
`c`:subscript:`n`\ ``)``.

``Tree``\ s are created with the ``Tree constructor``, which takes a
node value and zero or more children.
Here we see a simple tree with a single child node, itself a token::

  >>> from nltk_lite.parse.tree import Tree
  >>> tree1 = Tree('NP', ['John'])
  >>> tree1
  (NP: 'John')

Here is an example with two children::

  >>> tree2 = Tree('NP', ['the', 'man'])
  >>> tree2
  (NP: 'the' 'man')

Finally, here is a more complex example, where one of the
children is itself a tree::

  >>> tree3 = Tree('VP', ['saw', tree2])
  >>> tree3
  (VP: 'saw' (NP: 'the' 'man'))

A tree's node value is accessed with the ``node`` property:: 

  >>> tree1.node
  'NP'

A tree's children are accessed by indexing:: 

  >>> tree3[0]
  'saw'
  >>> tree3[1]
  (NP: 'the' 'man')
  >>> for child in tree3:
  ...     print child
  saw
  (NP: 'the' 'man')

The printed representation for complex trees can be difficult to read.
In these cases, the ``draw`` method can be very useful.  This method
opens a new window, containing a graphical representation of the tree::

  tree3.draw()

The tree display window allows you to zoom in and out;
to collapse and expand subtrees; and to print the graphical
representation to a postscript file. 

To compare multiple trees in a single window, use the ``draw_trees()``
method, from the ``nltk_lite.draw.tree`` module::

  from nltk_lite.draw.tree import draw_trees
  draw_trees(tree1, tree2, tree3)

The ``Tree`` class implements a number of other useful methods.  See
the ``Tree`` reference documentation for more information about these
methods.

  >>> tree3.leaves()
  ['saw', 'the', 'man']
  >>> tree3.height()
  3

..  Mention tree positions? -->

--------------------------------
 Initializing Trees from Strings 
--------------------------------

A convenient way to initialize a large tree is from a labelled
bracketing::

  >>> from nltk_lite.parse import bracket_parse
  >>> sent = '(VP (VBD saw) (NP (DT the) (NN man)))'
  >>> tree = bracket_parse(sent)
  >>> tree
  (VP: (VBD: 'saw') (NP: (DT: 'the') (NN: 'man')))

---------------------------------------
 Reading Trees from the Treebank Corpus 
---------------------------------------

The ``nltk_lite.corpora`` module defines the ``treebank`` corpus,
which contains a collection of hand-annotated parse trees for English
text.

..  Add a reference to LDC here?

  >>> from nltk_lite.corpora import treebank, extract
  >>> print extract(0, treebank.parsed())
  (S:
    (NP-SBJ:
      (NP: (NNP: 'Pierre') (NNP: 'Vinken'))
      (,: ',')
      (ADJP: (NP: (CD: '61') (NNS: 'years')) (JJ: 'old'))
      (,: ','))
    (VP:
      (MD: 'will')
      (VP:
        (VB: 'join')
        (NP: (DT: 'the') (NN: 'board'))
        (PP-CLR:
          (IN: 'as')
          (NP: (DT: 'a') (JJ: 'nonexecutive') (NN: 'director')))
        (NP-TMP: (NNP: 'Nov.') (CD: '29'))))
    (.: '.'))


--------------------
The Parser Interface 
--------------------

The ``parse`` module defines the ``ParseI`` interface, which defines
the set of methods which all parsers should support.  The ``ParseI``
interface defines two methods:

..  
 I say "n best" and "in descending order of quality" here,
 but so far we've only talked about grammars with no notion of
 parse quality.  Will that be confusing?

1. The ``parse`` method returns the single best parse for a given
   text.  The text is represented as a list of ``Tokens``.  If no
   parses are found for the given text, then ``parse`` returns
   ``None``.

#. The ``get_parse_list`` method returns a list of the parses for the
   given text.

For example, here is what the recursive descent parser generates for a
simple sentence and grammar::

  >>> from nltk_lite import tokenize
  >>> sent = list(tokenize.whitespace('I saw a man in the park'))
  >>> from nltk_lite import parse
  >>> rd_parser = parse.RecursiveDescent(grammar)

  >>> for p in rd_parser.get_parse_list(sent):
  ...     print p
  (S:
    (NP: 'I')
    (VP:
      (V: 'saw')
      (NP:
        (Det: 'a')
        (N: 'man')
        (PP: (P: 'in') (NP: (Det: 'the') (N: 'park'))))))
  (S:
    (NP: 'I')
    (VP:
      (V: 'saw')
      (NP: (Det: 'a') (N: 'man'))
      (PP: (P: 'in') (NP: (Det: 'the') (N: 'park')))))


----------------------------
The Recursive Descent Parser 
----------------------------

The ``nltk_lite.parse`` module defines ``RecursiveDescent``, a
simple recursive implementation of a top-down parser.  Unlike the
shift-reduce parser, this parser is guaranteed to find all parses for
a sentence.  But because it's a simple recursive top-down parser, it
can enter an infinite loop if the grammar contains a left-recursive
production.

Recursive descent parsers are created from ``CFGs`` by the
``RecursiveDescent`` constructor.  The constructor takes an optional
parameter ``trace``.  If ``trace`` is greater than zero, then the
parser will describe the steps that it takes as it parses a text.  By
default, the method ``trace()`` is initialized with a value of
`2`. Higher values of ``trace`` produce more verbose descriptions :: 



  >>> from nltk_lite.parse import *
  >>> rd_parser = RecursiveDescent(grammar)

The following example shows the trace output generated by
``rd_parser`` on a simple sentence, where ``E`` = expand and ``M`` =
match.  Material to the left of the asterisk has been matched and
incorporated into the parse tree::

  >>> sent = list(tokenize.whitespace('I saw a man'))
  >>> rd_parser.trace()
  >>> rd_parser.get_parse_list(sent)

NLTK also defines a graphical demonstration tool for the
recursive descent parser::

-----------------------
The Shift Reduce Parser
-----------------------

The ``nltk_lite.parse`` module defines ``ShiftReduce``, a simple
non-backtracking implementation of a bottom-up shift-reduce parser.
Since this parser does not implement any backtracking, it is not
guaranteed to find a parse for a text, even if one exists.
Furthermore, it will always find at most one parse, even if more
parses exist.

Shift reduce parsers are created from ``Grammars`` by the
``ShiftReduceParse`` constructor.  The constructor takes an optional
parameter ``trace``.  As with the recursive descent parser, this value
specifies how verbosely the parser should describe the steps that it
takes as it parses a text:: 

  >>> sr_parse = parse.ShiftReduce(grammar)

The following example shows the trace output generated by
``sr_parser`` on a simple sentence: 

  >>> sent = list(tokenize.whitespace('I saw a man'))
  >>> sr_parse.trace()
  >>> sr_parse.parse(sent)
  Parsing 'I saw a man'
      [ * I saw a man]
    S [ 'I' * saw a man]
    R [ <NP> * saw a man]
    S [ <NP> 'saw' * a man]
    R [ <NP> <V> * a man]
    S [ <NP> <V> 'a' * man]

NLTK also defines a graphical demonstration tool for the
shift reduce parser::

Exercises
---------

1. a) Encode `Example Tree 1`_ as a labeled bracketing and use the
      ``nltk_lite.parse`` module's ``bracket_parse()`` method to
      check that it is well-formed. Now use the ``draw()``
      method from the ``Tree`` class in module
      ``nltk_lite.parse.tree`` to display the tree.

   b) Extend `G2`_ with rules which expand prepositions as
      intransitive, transitive and requiring a ``PP``
      complement. Based on these rules, use the method of the
      preceding exercise to draw
      a tree for the sentence `Lee ran away home`\.

   c) As in (a) above, draw a tree for `The woman saw a man last Thursday`.


2. Pick some of the syntactic constructions described in any
   introductory syntax text (e.g. Jurafsky and Martin, Chapter 9) and
   create a set of 15 sentences.  Five sentences should be unambiguous
   (have a unique parse), five should be ambiguous, and a further five
   should be ungrammatical.

  a) Develop a small grammar, consisting of about ten syntactic
     productions, to account for this data.  Refine your set of sentences
     as needed to test and demonstrate the grammar.  Write a function
     to demonstrate your grammar on three sentences: (i) a
     sentence having exactly one parse; (ii) a sentence having more than
     one parse; (iii) a sentence having no parses.  Discuss your
     observations using inline comments.

  b) Create a list ``words`` of all the words in your lexicon, and use
     ``random.choice(words)`` to generate sequences of 5-10 randomly
     selected words.  Does this generate any grammatical sentences which
     your grammar rejects, or any ungrammatical sentences which your
     grammar accepts?  Now use this information to help you improve your
     grammar.  Discuss your findings.

3. A left-corner parser is a top-down parser with bottom-up filtering.
   Unlike an ordinary recursive descent parser, it does not get trapped
   in left-recursive productions.  Suppose `X` is a non-terminal that
   expands to some sequence `Y`:subscript:`1` |cdots| `Y`:subscript:`n`
   of terminals and non-terminals.  We call `Y`:subscript:`1` the
   *left-corner* of `X`.

  a) Write a function to preprocess the context-free grammar to build
     a table where each row contains two cells, the first holding a
     non-terminal, and the second holding the collection of possible
     left-corners of that non-terminal.

  b) Write a new parser (inheriting from ``ParseI``), based on the
     recursive descent parser, which builds this left-corner table
     when it is initialized on a grammar.  Now, each time a production
     is considered by the parser, check that the next input word is
     compatible with at least one of the pre-terminal categories in
     the left-corner table.

4. Compare the performance of the top-down, bottom-up, and left-corner
   parsers using the same grammar and three grammatical test
   sentences. Use ``time.time()`` to log the amount of time each
   parser takes on the same sentence.  Write a function which runs all
   three parsers on all three sentences, and prints a 3-by-3 grid of
   times, as well as row and column totals. Discuss your findings.

5. Pick some common verbs.

  a) Write a program to find those verbs in the PP Attachment Corpus
     included with NLTK-Lite.  Find any cases where the same verb
     exhibits two different attachments, but where the first noun,
     or second noun, or preposition, stay unchanged (as we saw in
     the PP Attachment Corpus example data above).

  b) Devise CFG grammar rules to cover some of these cases.
