CREDIT WARNING BY <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">MOODY'S<e_enamex> ON JAPANESE BONDS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">TOKYO<e_enamex> _ Borrowers in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Japan<e_enamex>, including even the healthiest
corporations, faced a new challenge on <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex> as <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Moody's Investors
Service<e_enamex> provided a pessimistic outlook on the nation's pristine
credit rating.
	   The exchange rate of <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Japan<e_enamex>'s currency, the yen, tumbled to a
<b_timex type="DURATION">six-and-a-half-year<e_timex> low, and the stock and bond markets fell on the
decision by the American-based ratings agency to change its view on
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Japan<e_enamex> _ whose government debt has been rated triple-A _ from
``stable'' to ``negative.''
	   <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Moody's<e_enamex> did not change any existing bond ratings, but the
negative outlook may lead to a formal review in <b_timex type="DURATION">18 months<e_timex> to <b_timex type="DURATION">two
years<e_timex>.
	   A lowered rating could raise borrowing costs for all Japanese,
from consumers to large corporations, even those with impeccable
credit. And such a move could further weaken Japanese banks, which
already pay more to borrow because they hold in excess of <b_numex type="MONEY">$600
billion<e_numex> in bad loans.
	   The step by <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Moody's<e_enamex> was a surprise because even with <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Japan<e_enamex>'s
economic problems, it is still the world's largest creditor nation
and there is little doubt about its ability to repay debts. But the
announcement showed that <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Moody's<e_enamex> _ <b_numex type="CARDINAL">one<e_numex> of the world's big credit
raters, along with <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Standard &AMP; Poor's<e_enamex> and <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Duff &AMP; Phelps<e_enamex> _ was
beginning to rethink <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Japan<e_enamex>'s long-term prospects.
	   In trading here <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex> the dollar surged to <b_numex type="MONEY">135.42 yen<e_numex>, the
highest since <b_timex type="DATE">September 1991<e_timex>, before recovering a little. The
benchmark <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Nikkei<e_enamex> index of <b_numex type="CARDINAL">225<e_numex> stocks fell for the third consecutive
day _ to a <b_timex type="DURATION">four-month<e_timex> low of <b_numex type="MONEY">15,517.78<e_numex>. Bond prices also declined,
pushing the yield on the key <b_timex type="DURATION">10-year<e_timex> Japanese government bond to
<b_numex type="PERCENT">1.685 percent<e_numex>, a <b_timex type="DURATION">six-week<e_timex> high. Bond prices and yields move in
opposite directions
	   ``The world doesn't trust <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Japan<e_enamex> anymore, even though <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Japan<e_enamex> has
lots of money,'' commented <b_enamex type="PERSON">Xinyi Lu<e_enamex> of <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Paribas Capital Markets Ltd.<e_enamex>
	   <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Moody's<e_enamex> lowered its rating of the government's yen-denominated
debt, typically the least risky securities. Moreover, it darkened
its outlook on <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Japan<e_enamex>'s sovereign ceiling, which is effectively the
government's ability to repay foreign-currency obligations. No
Japanese borrower can have a higher rating than the government, so
if the sovereign ceiling's rating is in time actually lowered, that
would hurt triple-A rated companies like <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Toyota<e_enamex> or the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Tokyo
Electric Power Company<e_enamex>.
	   <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Moody's<e_enamex> said the change reflected ``uncertainty about the
ability of the authorities to achieve a policy consensus'' to help
the economy.
	   It added that persistent weakness in the financial industry had
made <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Japan<e_enamex> more vulnerable, and it questioned whether official
efforts to stimulate the economy would work.
	   The chief cabinet secretary, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Kanezo Muraoka<e_enamex>, reacted to the
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Moody's<e_enamex> news by saying, ``the government understands <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Japan<e_enamex> has
strong fundamentals in many respects.''
	   The <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Moody's<e_enamex> announcement was the finale in a <b_timex type="DURATION">weak<e_timex> of
particularly bad economic news in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Japan<e_enamex>. A government attempt to
buoy the stock market by purchasing shares had only fleeting
effects. A central bank quarterly survey of business sentiment, the
Tankan, showed some of the worst pessimism in <b_timex type="DURATION">20 years<e_timex>. And <b_enamex type="PERSON">Norio
Ohga<e_enamex>, chairman of the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Sony Corporation<e_enamex>, <b_numex type="CARDINAL">one<e_numex> of the strongest
Japanese companies, said the economy was verging on collapse. On
<b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex>, the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Economic Planning Agency<e_enamex> said the economy had stagnated
for the last <b_timex type="DURATION">two months<e_timex>.

NEW DRUG FOR IMPOTENCE RAISES HOPE FOR ITS USE BY WOMEN, TOO
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   The buzz over the new impotence drug, Viagra, has prompted many
women and researchers to wonder whether it could improve the sex
lives of women if they took it as well. And, in the process, it is
generating new interest in sex research in general and women's
sexual problems in particular.
	   For decades, the field of sex research has been a scientific
backwater, researchers acknowledge. The federal government kept
away from sex research and serious investigators considered it
career suicide to go into an area that lacked federal financing and
evoked snickers from other researchers.
	   Even Viagra was discovered by accident. <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Pfizer<e_enamex>, its maker, was
looking for a drug to relieve the chest pain of heart disease. The
compound, sildenafil citrate in pill form, did not work as
intended, but it had an unexpected side effect: some men taking
Viagra found that it resulted in prolonged or enhanced erections.
	   When <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Pfizer<e_enamex> scientists decided to investigate its usefulness as
an impotence remedy, they had to learn about the biochemistry and
neurobiology of erections. They also had to pay for developing a
survey to determine whether erections, sexual performance and
sexual desire improved and, if so, by how much.
	   Now many doctors want to know whether Viagra works on women,
since the clitoris is the female version of the penis and thus
becomes engorged with blood during sexual arousal. But how, they
ask, should they measure arousal in women, especially since
relatively little is known about sexual function and dysfunction
among women?
	   Until researchers solve that problem, <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Pfizer<e_enamex>'s plans to test the
effects of Viagra on women cannot begin. In the meantime,
researchers say, women have been calling them and asking about the
pill.
	   But even asking about whether Viagra works for women has meant
starting the sort of sex research that has been stymied, experts
said. Viagra ``has opened the door to the study of sexual
function,'' said Dr. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Raymond Rosen<e_enamex>, a sex researcher and professor
of psychiatry at the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Robert Wood Johnson Medical School<e_enamex> in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">New
Brunswick<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">N.J.<e_enamex>
	   While some welcome the change, others ask how money and
attention from drug companies will alter a field that has focused
as much on feelings and relationships as it has on physiology and
mechanics.
	   With drug company money, ``the studies have been so mechanical _
is it hard? how wide is it? how big is it? how many seconds does it
last?'' said Dr. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Leonore Tiefer<e_enamex>, a sex researcher and clinical
professor of psychiatry at <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">New York Medical Center<e_enamex>.
	   But ``I think of an erection as a means to an end,'' <b_enamex type="PERSON">Tiefer<e_enamex>
said, ``something suitable to a couple rather than something you
measure in the guy in the lab.''
	   Some researchers wonder whether it will be good or bad for
relationships if a new generation of drugs enhances sexual
functioning for people who have been getting along fine with
less-than-peak performance.
	   ``Think of this like winning the sexual lottery,'' said Dr.
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Pepper Schwartz<e_enamex>, a sociology professor at the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">University of
Washington<e_enamex>. ``You might think in a lottery that if a little money
is good, a lot must be great. But that is not always true.''
	   Yet some say that the anticipated renaissance for sex research
is long overdue, particularly for women.
	   ``We can argue that as a society sexual functioning shouldn't
have the image it has,'' said <b_enamex type="PERSON">Rosen<e_enamex>. But sexual dysfunction ``for
the people involved, it can be devastating,'' he said.
	   If anything, he added, sexual problems are more common in women
than in men and, as in men, they are more common as people get
older. For women, a major issue is lack of desire. Yet <b_enamex type="PERSON">Rosen<e_enamex> said
much remained unknown:
	   ``What is the relationship between lack of desire and measures
of sexual performance _ lubrication and arousal? Is it that women
lose desire and then develop arousal difficulties or is it the
other way around?''
	   Women may complain of a lack of desire because it is more
acceptable for them to say that than to say they have difficulty
becoming aroused, Dr. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Rosen<e_enamex> said.
	   A <b_numex type="MEASURE">55-year<e_numex>-old nurse at the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">University of Maryland<e_enamex> said she could
not decide whether her problem was lack of desire or lack of an
ability to become aroused.
	   ``When you're younger, you could look at someone and all those
bells and whistles would go off,'' the nurse said, speaking on the
condition of anonymity. But ``when you are with your partner for a
long time,'' she added, ``a certain boredom sets in.'' So maybe
Viagra ``could be the answer to that,'' she said.
	   The nurse said she, and virtually every woman she knew, would
like to try Viagra.
	   ``I think everyone wonders if it could be better,'' she said.
	   At least <b_numex type="CARDINAL">one<e_numex> researcher, Dr. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Irwin Goldstein<e_enamex>, a professor of
urology at the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Boston University School of Medicine<e_enamex>, said his
research indicated that the problem for middle-aged women was the
same as it was for middle-aged men: a paucity of blood flowing to
the sex organs. And if <b_enamex type="PERSON">Goldstein<e_enamex> is correct, it makes at least
theoretical sense that Viagra be helpful for women.
	   It was <b_enamex type="PERSON">Goldstein<e_enamex> whose survey of <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Massachusetts<e_enamex> men indicated
that about <b_numex type="CARDINAL">half<e_numex> of all men aged <b_numex type="MEASURE">40<e_numex> to <b_numex type="MEASURE">70<e_numex> had difficulties obtaining
or maintaining erections. He also discovered that the problem was
most common among men with conditions that can lead to vascular
problems that can lead to diminished flow in blood vessels, like
diabetes. Now <b_enamex type="PERSON">Goldstein<e_enamex> and his colleagues are extending their
research to women.
	   To get an idea of how common sexual problems are in women,
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Goldstein<e_enamex> surveyed <b_numex type="CARDINAL">300<e_numex> women whose partners had consulted him about
impotency.
	   Defining sexual dysfunction as discomfort during sexual
intercourse, dryness, increased time for arousal, diminished
ability to reach orgasm, or diminished clitoral sensation,
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Goldstein<e_enamex> found that <b_numex type="PERCENT">58 percent<e_numex> of the women were affected. And, as
like men, the women were more likely to have sexual difficulties if
they were older and if they had medical conditions relating to
vascular problems.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Goldstein<e_enamex> and Dr. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Jennifer Berman<e_enamex>, a urologist at the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">University
of Maryland<e_enamex> in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Baltimore<e_enamex>, also examined the blood vessels that
supplied the clitorises of cadavers and those of women undergoing
X-ray examinations of the arteries for vascular disease. They found
that just as disease and aging cause blood vessels to narrow in
other parts of the body, the sexual organs were similarly affected,
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Goldstein<e_enamex> said.
	   ``The whole field changes now,'' he said.
	   Sexual dysfunction, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Goldstein<e_enamex> said, is no longer mostly a
psychosomatic complaint, it is not something to be resolved only
through years of therapy, and it is not a problem for a urologist
alone.
	   Instead, he said, sexual dysfunction ``is in essence a vascular
disease.'' It is, he said, ``a heart attack of the vagina, a heart
attack of the clitoris, a heart attack of the penis.''

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">WASHINGTON<e_enamex> _ Eager to shift the spotlight from <b_enamex type="PERSON">Paula Jones<e_enamex> back
to the business of government, President <b_enamex type="PERSON">Clinton<e_enamex> lambasted the
Republican <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Senate<e_enamex> budget proposal on <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex> and warned tobacco
companies to go along with a proposed settlement.
	   Tired but buoyant in his first day back at the Oval Office after
<b_timex type="DURATION">12 days<e_timex> in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Africa<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Clinton<e_enamex> immediately assembled his economic team
in the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">White House<e_enamex> Rose Garden this morning and signaled an
election-year showdown with congressional Republicans over the
budget for the <b_timex type="DATE">1999 fiscal year<e_timex>. While clearly emboldened by a
federal judge's dismissal on <b_timex type="DATE">Wednesday<e_timex> of Mrs. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Jones<e_enamex>' sexual
misconduct lawsuit, the president vowed not to be distracted by
such matters, saying, ``I am going on with my business.''
	   Instead, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Clinton<e_enamex> castigated <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Senate<e_enamex> Republicans for approving a
<b_numex type="MONEY">$1.73 trillion<e_numex> spending plan on <b_timex type="DATE">Thursday<e_timex> night that calls for
modest tax cuts and excludes virtually all of the president's
proposals for new spending. And he scolded members of the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">House<e_enamex> for
passing a <b_timex type="DURATION">six-year<e_timex>, <b_numex type="MONEY">$217 billion<e_numex> transportation bill packed with
projects for almost every congressional district.
	   ``I am very concerned that the budget plan now working its way
through the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Senate<e_enamex> will squeeze out critical investments in
education and children,'' <b_enamex type="PERSON">Clinton<e_enamex> said. ``I'm also determined that
highway spending, though it is quite important and though our
budget provides for a very impressive increase in investment in
highways and mass transit, must be within the balanced budget and
not crowd out critical investments in education, child care, health
care or threaten our budget discipline.''
	   Sen. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Trent Lott<e_enamex>, R-<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Miss.<e_enamex>, the majority leader, dismissed the
president's comments, asserting: ``We have our priorities, he has
his priorities. Education is a high priority for us.''
	   Asserting that it was <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Republicans<e_enamex>, not <b_enamex type="PERSON">Clinton<e_enamex>, who sought more
money for education training, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Lott<e_enamex> said, ``He needs to check his
figures before he starts complaining.''
	   Moving from <b_numex type="CARDINAL">one<e_numex> domestic priority to another, the president
called on tobacco companies to go along with the bill that was
approved this week by the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Senate Commerce Committee<e_enamex>, even though it
was tougher on the companies than the proposed settlement they
agreed to last <b_timex type="DATE">summer<e_timex>.
	   ``I am determined to seize this historic opportunity to pass
bipartisan legislation to protect our children from the dangers of
tobacco,'' he said. ``This <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Congress<e_enamex> can be the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Congress<e_enamex> that saves
<b_numex type="CARDINAL">millions<e_numex> of children's lives.''
	   The cigarette companies, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Clinton<e_enamex> said, needed to ``reverse the
record of the past, to try to put this unforgivable chapter behind
them.''
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Lott<e_enamex>, meanwhile, said that if the tobacco settlement did not
reach the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Senate<e_enamex> floor by <b_timex type="DATE">June 1<e_timex>, ``it's going to be pretty hard''
to bring it to a vote this year. ``I'm not saying it's
impossible,'' the senator said. ``But I think that the best time to
do it would be before we go out for the <b_timex type="DATE">Memorial Day<e_timex> recess.''
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Clinton<e_enamex> was unusually jaunty at his <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">White House<e_enamex> homecoming
event. Trying to put the best face on figures showing a slight rise
in unemployment, which were made public shortly before his Rose
Garden appearance, he said, ``While there will be ups and downs,
our economy continues to be <b_numex type="CARDINAL">one<e_numex> of the strongest in history.''
<ANNOTATION>
	   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
	   <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">White House<e_enamex> officials said <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex>'s appearance was the prelude
to a number of events next week _ on issues ranging from Social
Security to crime to school construction _ to showcase the
president's domestic agenda and turn the focus from allegations
about sex and cover-up at the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">White House<e_enamex>.
	   ``The American people want us to use this sunlit moment not to
sit back and enjoy, but to act,'' <b_enamex type="PERSON">Clinton<e_enamex> said firmly. ``We were
hired by the American people to act.''
	   Questioned about <b_enamex type="PERSON">Monica Lewinsky<e_enamex>, the former <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">White House<e_enamex> intern
accused of having a relationship with <b_enamex type="PERSON">Clinton<e_enamex>, he said: ``I am not
going to comment on that. I am going to try to do what the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Supreme
Court<e_enamex> said I should do, which is not to be in any way deterred by
this.''
	   The president was in such high spirits that he teased Vice
President <b_enamex type="PERSON">Al Gore<e_enamex>, who turned <b_numex type="MEASURE">50<e_numex> while <b_enamex type="PERSON">Clinton<e_enamex> was in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Africa<e_enamex>. ``I
hope all of you noticed the increased gravity and maturity of his
aura,'' <b_enamex type="PERSON">Clinton<e_enamex> said. ``I personally am greatly relieved. Not long
before he turned <b_numex type="MEASURE">50<e_numex>, as I told him when I called him, an elderly
lady came up to me and said, `I think you and that young man are
doing such a good job.' And it's nice to have a middle-aged team
now at the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">White House<e_enamex>.''
	   Soon after the event, the president took an early slide and went
golfing with his wife's brothers, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Hugh<e_enamex> and <b_enamex type="PERSON">Tony Rodham<e_enamex>.

STRONG <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">GM<e_enamex> SALES HELP SLOW DECLINE FOR INDUSTRY
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">DETROIT<e_enamex> _ Auto sales fell <b_numex type="PERCENT">1.7 percent<e_numex> last month, although
strong results from a rebate-fueled sales drive by <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">General Motors
Corp.<e_enamex> helped offset weak sales at many other auto makers.
	   <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">GM<e_enamex> said <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex> that its sales rose <b_numex type="PERCENT">3.7 percent<e_numex> in <b_timex type="DATE">March<e_timex>,
compared with the <b_timex type="DATE">1997<e_timex> period, helping pull up the results for the
industry as a whole. <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Ford Motor Co.<e_enamex> said <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex> that its sales fell
<b_numex type="PERCENT">2.6 percent<e_numex>.
	   <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">GM<e_enamex>'s top sales and marketing executive also signaled a change in
management's view on offering the rebates and other incentives that
customers love but investors dread. The company, which had watched
its market share dwindle as it tried to avoid offering costly
discounts, acknowledged a need to stabilize its share of the car
and truck market.
	   ``There is no one in <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">General Motors<e_enamex> who doesn't understand and
believe that market share is important, and that's the way we're
going to manage the business going forward,'' said <b_enamex type="PERSON">Ronald L.
Zarrella<e_enamex>, a <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">GM<e_enamex> vice president in charge of sales, service and
marketing. ``In the absence of a fairly crippling strike or labor
action, it would be unlikely that our share would be under <b_numex type="PERCENT">30
percent<e_numex> for any period of time.''
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Zarrella<e_enamex> insisted <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">GM<e_enamex> would pay for the expensive rebates and
other incentives by cutting costs elsewhere, rather than by turning
in lower-than-expected profits. ``We are going to be competitive
going forward, and we think we can cut costs enough to make our
profitability objectives and to make our market share objectives,''
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Zarrella<e_enamex> said.
	   Wall Street was untroubled by the reversal. ``It is a shift,''
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Wendy Beale Needham<e_enamex>, an auto analyst at <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette<e_enamex>, said. ``It is only acknowledging the realities of the
marketplace _ that if everyone else is using incentives, you can't
sell without incentives.'' However, she said <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">GM<e_enamex> should be able to
offer more discounts without unduly crimping profits because it
could cut costs faster than it would need to increase incentives.
	   The company's strategy change came after a dismal showing in
<b_timex type="DATE">February<e_timex>, when sales were so weak that <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">GM<e_enamex>'s market share skidded to
<b_numex type="PERCENT">28.7 percent<e_numex>, well below the <b_numex type="PERCENT">30 percent<e_numex> level considered an
important psychological barrier. Last month, <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">GM<e_enamex> fought back with an
onslaught of rebates and discounts on loans and leases, and by
stepping up its television advertising.
	   It worked. <b_timex type="DATE">March<e_timex> sales rose <b_numex type="PERCENT">3.7 percent<e_numex> over all, compared with
the period a <b_timex type="DURATION">year<e_timex> earlier, with car sales falling <b_numex type="PERCENT">1.9 percent<e_numex> and
sales of sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickup trucks rising
<b_numex type="PERCENT">11.0 percent<e_numex>. The company's market share jumped to <b_numex type="PERCENT">33 percent<e_numex> _
well above the <b_numex type="PERCENT">31.3 percent<e_numex> share for all of last <b_timex type="DURATION">year<e_timex>, and far
better than <b_timex type="DATE">February<e_timex>'s dismal showing.
	   For the auto industry as a whole, the seasonally adjusted annual
rate of sales reached a healthy <b_numex type="CARDINAL">15.1 million<e_numex> in <b_timex type="DATE">March<e_timex>, below the
robust <b_numex type="CARDINAL">15.5 million<e_numex> annual rate during the period a <b_timex type="DURATION">year<e_timex> earlier
but slightly better than the <b_numex type="CARDINAL">15 million<e_numex> annual rate in <b_timex type="DATE">February<e_timex>.
	   For Wall Street, the <b_timex type="DATE">March<e_timex> results were reassuring despite the
<b_numex type="PERCENT">1.7 percent<e_numex> sales drop industrywide. ``The decline is only because
the <b_timex type="DURATION">year<e_timex>-ago number was so high,'' <b_enamex type="PERSON">David Bradley<e_enamex>, an auto analyst
at <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.<e_enamex>, said. ``We've fallen down to normal
selling rates, but still robust and healthy rates.''
	   <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Ford<e_enamex> said its <b_numex type="PERCENT">2.6 percent<e_numex> sales decline was a result of forgone
sales from <b_numex type="CARDINAL">five<e_numex> cars and trucks the company discontinued because
they were unprofitable. <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Ford<e_enamex>'s car sales fell <b_numex type="PERCENT">5.9 percent<e_numex> while the

network of <b_numex type="CARDINAL">159<e_numex> offices across the country.
	   In addition, <b_enamex type="PERSON">McCarthy<e_enamex> played an important part in the move to
open Wall Street firms to public ownership. <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Merrill<e_enamex> itself
converted from a partnership to become a public company in <b_timex type="DATE">1959<e_timex>.
``We sincerely believe public ownership would increase and
stabilize the capital positions of member firms,'' <b_enamex type="PERSON">McCarthy<e_enamex> said at
the time. Since then, most big Wall Street firms, except <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Goldman,

<b_enamex type="PERSON">McCarthy<e_enamex> pressed the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Big Board<e_enamex> to give the nation's stockholders a
greater voice in the exchange's affairs. In <b_timex type="DATE">August 1963<e_timex>, he urged
it to ``get away from the onus of a private club.''

the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Mutual Stores Grocery<e_enamex> chain in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Oakland<e_enamex>.

brokerage firm's founder, got to know <b_enamex type="PERSON">McCarthy<e_enamex> as a result of that
transaction and was impressed by his bookkeeping skills.

<b_enamex type="PERSON">CLINTON<e_enamex> SAYS <b_enamex type="LOCATION">JAPAN<e_enamex> MUST CHANGE ECONOMIC POLICY
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">WASHINGTON<e_enamex> _ President <b_enamex type="PERSON">Clinton<e_enamex> warned in unusually explicit
terms <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex> that <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Japan<e_enamex> must change course if it hopes to pull its
economy out of a long-running decline that has worsened markedly in
recent weeks.
	   He made his comments as evidence mounted that <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Japan<e_enamex>, already
languishing in recession, is headed into <b_numex type="CARDINAL">one<e_numex> of its worst downturns
since the end of World War II, and the yen fell to a
<b_timex type="DURATION">six-and-a-half-year<e_timex> low against the dollar.
	   While <b_enamex type="PERSON">Clinton<e_enamex> issued his warning to <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Japan<e_enamex> in response to a
question at a news conference, he was clearly ready to send a
strong message, saying, ``You simply can't stay with a strategy
that is clearly not appropriate to the times and expect it to get
the results that are needed for the country.''
	   For months <b_enamex type="LOCATION">U.S.<e_enamex> officials have become increasingly specific
about what they believe <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Japan<e_enamex> must do, advocating huge tax cuts and
old-fashioned deficit spending to spur an economy that many experts
say could shrink by <b_numex type="PERCENT">2 percent<e_numex> this year.
	   The president was careful to praise <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Japan<e_enamex>'s embattled prime
minister, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Ryutaro Hashimoto<e_enamex>, as ``an able man,'' but he said there
was clearly ``an ongoing struggle'' with an entrenched bureaucracy.
	   His comments stepped up the recent public pressure from <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Treasury<e_enamex>
Secretary <b_enamex type="PERSON">Robert Rubin<e_enamex> and leaders from several of the world's
biggest economic powers, who have said repeatedly that <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Japan<e_enamex>'s
economic decline and its inability to absorb imports from
neighboring countries threaten to undermine <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Asia<e_enamex>'s fragile
recovery.
	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">U.S.<e_enamex> officials have a more specific concern: the risk that a
collapse of more major Japanese banks and securities dealers could
imperil Wall Street, just as the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones<e_enamex> Industrial Average
crossed <b_numex type="MONEY">9,000<e_numex> for the first time.
	   That is hardly a foregone conclusion. But <b_enamex type="LOCATION">U.S.<e_enamex> companies are
already reporting that their exports to <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Asia<e_enamex> are dropping
drastically, and a collapse in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Japan<e_enamex>, many say, could start a new
round of economic contagion that could reach further than the
crises in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Southeast Asia<e_enamex> and <b_enamex type="LOCATION">South Korea<e_enamex>.
	   Administration officials made clear that <b_enamex type="PERSON">Clinton<e_enamex>'s comments
<b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex> had been carefully planned.
	   ``He's been building to this for a long time,'' <b_numex type="CARDINAL">one<e_numex> senior
official said. ``We're looking at an economic actor, the world's
second-largest economy, whose decisions affect the globe, and there
is a growing sense that they are not up to the task, that they do
not understand the gravity of the situation for <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Japan<e_enamex> and the rest
of the world. There is simply a loss of confidence.''
	   On <b_timex type="DATE">Thursday<e_timex> the chairman of <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Sony Corp.<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Norio Ohga<e_enamex>, a man not
given to alarmist statements, warned that <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Japan<e_enamex>'s economy ``is on
the verge of collapsing.''
	   He compared Prime Minister <b_enamex type="PERSON">Hashimoto<e_enamex> to President <b_enamex type="PERSON">Hoover<e_enamex> on the
eve of the <b_timex type="DATE">1929<e_timex> stock-market collapse in the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">United States<e_enamex>. ``If
you look at what <b_enamex type="PERSON">Hoover<e_enamex> was saying at the start of the Great
Depression and what <b_enamex type="PERSON">Hashimoto<e_enamex> is saying at the moment, they are
very similar,'' <b_enamex type="PERSON">Ohga<e_enamex> warned.
<ANNOTATION>
	   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
	   But the sharp reactions in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Japan<e_enamex>'s stock and currency markets
seem to have been driven by <b_numex type="CARDINAL">two<e_numex> different events. The first was the
end of the Japanese fiscal year on <b_timex type="DATE">Tuesday<e_timex>. For days before that
deadline, the Japanese government was investing heavily in the
country's stock market, trying to boost the price of stocks held by
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Japan<e_enamex>'s banks, which are burdened with <b_numex type="MONEY">hundreds of billions of
dollars<e_numex> of bad debts.
	   The goal was to make year-end balance sheets appear far sounder
than they really were, so banks would meet international
requirements for lending around the world. But the stock prices
never rose as far as Japanese officials had hoped, and as soon as
the deadline passed, prices dropped steeply.
	   The second alarm came from <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Moody's Investors Service<e_enamex>, <b_numex type="CARDINAL">one<e_numex> of the
world's leading financial rating agencies, which issued an unusual
warning about <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Japan<e_enamex> on <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex>.
	   While <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Moody's<e_enamex> did not drop the Japanese government's triple-A
rating, the highest it grants to any country, it altered its
outlook to ``negative.'' Although there is virtually no fear that
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Japan<e_enamex> could default on its government debt _ the country has
<b_numex type="MONEY">hundreds of billions of dollars<e_numex> in reserves _ the warning made
investors who fear rising bankruptcies extremely skittish.
	   The <b_enamex type="LOCATION">United States<e_enamex> has been warning <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Japan<e_enamex> to take far stronger
economic action for more than <b_timex type="DURATION">18 months<e_timex> now. A <b_timex type="DURATION">year<e_timex> ago, when
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Hashimoto<e_enamex> visited the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">White House<e_enamex>, he made a detailed economic
presentation to <b_enamex type="PERSON">Clinton<e_enamex>, Vice President <b_enamex type="PERSON">Al Gore<e_enamex> and top economic
officials, arguing that a <b_numex type="PERCENT">3 percent<e_numex> tax increase that <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Japan<e_enamex> was
imposing would not send the economy into a tailspin.
	   He was wrong. In <b_timex type="DATE">November<e_timex>, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Hashimoto<e_enamex> admitted that the tax
increase, which had been pressed by bureaucrats in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Japan<e_enamex>'s <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Finance
Ministry<e_enamex>, had been a major mistake. But he has not moved to repeal
the tax, and so far the economic programs he has announced to spur
the economy have been a murky mixture of new and previously
announced ones.
	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Japan<e_enamex>'s ambassador to <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Washington<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Kunihiko Saito<e_enamex>, said <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex>
that he had no problem with the mounting pressure from <b_enamex type="PERSON">Clinton<e_enamex>.
	   ``We Japanese now realize that the old system that worked in the
past doesn't work anymore,'' he said <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex>. ``We have to reform
ourselves, and change our system.'' But, he added, ``Sometimes
public statements can be counterproductive, and we have been asking
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">U.S.<e_enamex> officials to be careful in their public statements.''

	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">PRICE<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Utah<e_enamex> _ Down by the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Price River<e_enamex>, the bare, twisted limbs
of a dried-out cottonwood are enough to make a grown man shudder.
	   ``It's still there, scary and ominous as ever,'' the Rev. <b_enamex type="PERSON">France
Davis<e_enamex>, pastor of <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Salt Lake City<e_enamex>'s largest black church, said after
visiting the old tree, site of what historians say was the last
lynching of a black man in the <b_enamex type="LOCATION" status="opt">American West<e_enamex>.
	   On <b_timex type="DATE">Saturday<e_timex>, the 30th anniversary of the assassination of the
Rev. Dr. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Martin Luther King Jr.<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Davis<e_enamex> and other religious leaders,

Lynched <b_timex type="DATE">June 18, 1925<e_timex>. A Victim of Intolerance. May <b_enamex type="PERSON">God<e_enamex> Forgive.''
	   But on the eve of that gathering, for what the organizers call a
ceremony of ``reconciliation and forgiveness,'' this close-knit
coal mining town in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Utah<e_enamex>'s desert canyonlands is being torn apart
by the memories that the occasion was intended to evoke.
	   ``A man came out of the store with a rope, and my father asked,
`What's going on?''' recalled <b_enamex type="PERSON">C. Matthew Gilmour<e_enamex>, <b_numex type="MEASURE">88<e_numex>, a white

`a necktie party.'

men briefly held for the lynching. ``Why attack the second and
third generation?''
	   As a result of the controversy brought on by plans for the
gathering, she said, ``I can't go shopping, I can't go to the
beauty shop _ people always ask me about it.''
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Gilmour<e_enamex> says it was President <b_enamex type="PERSON">Clinton<e_enamex>'s call for a national
dialogue on race that inspired him and the other organizers to plan
ceremonies at the resting place of a lynching victim who for <b_timex type="DURATION">73
years<e_timex> has lain in an unmarked grave.
	   But with the reconciliation day organized largely by outsiders
from <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Salt Lake City<e_enamex>, much of <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Price<e_enamex> has retreated. Isolated by
geography, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Carbon County<e_enamex>, with only <b_numex type="CARDINAL">20,000<e_numex> residents, has long felt
alienated from <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Salt Lake City<e_enamex>, <b_numex type="MEASURE">120 miles<e_numex> to the northwest.
Unionized, industrial, Democratic and a religious and ethnic mix,
the county is an anomaly in a state that is overwhelmingly
anti-union, Republican and Mormon.
	   ``Once again, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Carbon County<e_enamex> gets the black mark,'' objected <b_enamex type="PERSON">J.
Eldon Dorman<e_enamex>, an <b_numex type="MEASURE">88-year<e_numex>-old retired doctor, echoing a sentiment
heard around town. ``This was not a racist thing at all. If
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Marshall<e_enamex> had been an Italian or a Greek, he would have gotten the
same thing.''
	   But events of the period suggest the contrary. For instance, in
a mining strike here <b_timex type="DURATION">three years<e_timex> before the lynching of <b_enamex type="PERSON">Marshall<e_enamex>,
workers shot and killed <b_numex type="CARDINAL">two<e_numex> coal company guards. <b_numex type="CARDINAL">Three<e_numex> Greek
immigrant miners were arrested, tried and convicted. <b_numex type="CARDINAL">One<e_numex> was
sentenced to <b_timex type="DURATION">20 years<e_timex> in prison, the others to life. Strong
community, church and labor support for them applied the brake to
any inclination toward vigilantism.
	   In contrast, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Marshall<e_enamex>, hanged amid a bitter later strike, was
<b_numex type="CARDINAL">one<e_numex> of only <b_numex type="CARDINAL">100<e_numex> or so blacks in the entire county. He had no family
nearby, no church to support him.
	   As the ceremony's critics point out, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Marshall<e_enamex> had a criminal
record and, by the account of historians, did shoot the guard, <b_numex type="CARDINAL">five<e_numex>
times.
	   But ``whether he was guilty or not is irrelevant,'' said <b_enamex type="PERSON">Larry
Gerlach<e_enamex>, a <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">University of Utah<e_enamex> history professor who wrote ``Blazing
Crosses in Zion: The Ku Klux Klan in Utah'' (<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Utah State University
Press<e_enamex>, <b_timex type="DATE">1982<e_timex>). ``Justice was subverted.''

</ANNOTATION>
	   That <b_timex type="DATE">summer<e_timex> the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Ku Klux Klan<e_enamex> started organizing here, making
targets of Italian and Greek immigrants, whom the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Klan<e_enamex> blamed for
the <b_timex type="DATE">1922<e_timex> strike. Then, with coal prices slumping in the <b_timex type="DATE">spring of
1925<e_timex>, <b_numex type="CARDINAL">two<e_numex> coal companies here tried to slash miners' wages,
bringing on the second strike. The mean mood boiled over with the
shooting of another company guard and the capture and lynching of
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Marshall<e_enamex>.
	   As many as <b_numex type="CARDINAL">1,000<e_numex> people gathered for the hanging, some with
picnic lunches. ``You would have seen your neighbors, your
friends'' and ``folks prominent in church and social circles,'' <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">The
Price Sun<e_enamex> reported the next day.
	   <b_numex type="CARDINAL">One<e_numex> witness was <b_enamex type="PERSON">J. Bracken Lee<e_enamex>, a local insurance agent who
later became <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Price<e_enamex>'s mayor and <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Utah<e_enamex>'s governor. ``I'd say there
were enough ropes there to hang <b_numex type="CARDINAL">20<e_numex> people,'' he told an interviewer
in <b_timex type="DATE">1977<e_timex>.
	   The authorities detained <b_numex type="CARDINAL">11<e_numex> men, mostly Klansmen who were
employees of <b_numex type="CARDINAL">one<e_numex> of the struck concerns, the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Utah Fuel Co.<e_enamex> During
an inquiry by a grand jury that heard <b_numex type="CARDINAL">124<e_numex> witnesses, the jailed men
were feted by townspeople with ice cream and home-cooked meals.
	   No one identified any member of the mob, and the <b_numex type="CARDINAL">11<e_numex> suspects
were freed. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Gerlach<e_enamex> recalls that in interviews he conducted here
<b_timex type="DURATION">half a century<e_timex> after the lynching, ``I had a number of people tell
me, `Yeah, I lied''' to the grand jury.
	   ``The response was always the same,'' <b_enamex type="PERSON">Gerlach<e_enamex> said. ```We
weren't going to do anything to take down members of our

SWISS CENTRAL BANK TO FIGHT HOLOCAUST CLAIMS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">BONN<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Germany<e_enamex> _ <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Switzerland<e_enamex>'s central bank served notice on
<b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex> with unusual bluntness that it would fight a planned
class-action lawsuit in the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">United States<e_enamex> that accuses the bank of
accepting looted assets from <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Germany<e_enamex> during the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Nazi<e_enamex> era.
	   The bank, called the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Swiss National Bank<e_enamex>, also disputed the
American courts' jurisdiction.
	   The suit alleges that the bank ``collaborated with <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Nazi<e_enamex> <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Germany<e_enamex>
in the knowing receipt of looted assets,'' including gold, bonds,
and securities, said <b_enamex type="PERSON">Michael Hausfeld<e_enamex>, a <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Washington<e_enamex> lawyer
representing Holocaust victims and heirs.
	   He said in a telephone interview on <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex> that the suit had
been prepared but not yet filed and did not specify an amount for
restitution. He said that despite the tough stand taken by the
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Swiss National Bank<e_enamex>, preparations for the suit would continue, but
that he had not decided where in the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">United States<e_enamex> it would be
filed.
	   In a statement, the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Swiss National Bank<e_enamex> declared: ``We are
resolved to oppose any such action, which would have no basis in
law, with all the legal means at our disposal, particularly since
we contest the competence of the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">U.S.<e_enamex> courts in our case.''
	   The statement added: ``An out-of-court settlement does not enter
into consideration.''
	   The statement came just <b_timex type="DURATION">eight days<e_timex> after <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Switzerland<e_enamex>'s big <b_numex type="CARDINAL">three<e_numex>
private banks agreed to negotiate what was termed a ``global
settlement'' to halt <b_numex type="CARDINAL">three<e_numex> separate class-action suits brought by
Holocaust survivors.
	   The central bank was not named in those suits, which seek some
<b_numex type="MONEY">$20 billion<e_numex> in restitution of assets stolen by the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Nazis<e_enamex> and
stashed in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Switzerland<e_enamex> during and after World War II.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Werner Abegg<e_enamex>, a <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Swiss National Bank<e_enamex> spokesman in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Zurich<e_enamex>, said
that the statement on <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex> had been issued to ``make it very
clear that, even under the threat of a class-action suit, the
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">National Bank<e_enamex>, as a public body, cannot make an out-of-court
settlement.''
	   An independent inquiry by Swiss historians found that the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Swiss
National Bank<e_enamex> had bought some <b_numex type="MONEY">$389 million<e_numex> worth of gold _ at
wartime prices _ from <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Nazi<e_enamex> <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Germany<e_enamex>, while a further <b_numex type="MONEY">$61 million<e_numex> was
purchased through private Swiss banks. At present prices, those
figures would be multiplied roughly <b_numex type="CARDINAL">nine<e_numex>fold.
	   The <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Swiss National Bank<e_enamex> estimates its own purchases of <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Nazi<e_enamex> gold
at <b_numex type="MONEY">$280 million<e_numex>, at wartime exchange rates, and acknowledges that
it was the largest buyer of gold from the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">German Reichsbank<e_enamex>.
	   But under an agreement with the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">United States<e_enamex> and other Western
powers reached in <b_timex type="DATE">1946<e_timex>, the Swiss authorities agreed to pay back
only some <b_numex type="MONEY">$58 million<e_numex>.
	   Since the gold sold by <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Nazi<e_enamex> <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Germany<e_enamex> included bullion looted from
central banks in occupied <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Europe<e_enamex> and gold stolen from Jews and
other individuals _ known as ``victim gold'' _ Swiss institutions
have been under mounting pressure to repay far more than either the
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">National Bank<e_enamex> or the commercial banks have acknowledged holding.
	   The <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">World Jewish Congress<e_enamex> estimates that gold purchased by
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Switzerland<e_enamex> during the war that had been stolen from individuals,
including Jews dispatched to <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Nazi<e_enamex> death camps, would be worth <b_numex type="MONEY">$1
billion<e_numex> today, said <b_enamex type="PERSON">Elan Steinberg<e_enamex>, the organization's executive
director in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">New York<e_enamex>.
	   In its statement on <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex>, the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Swiss National Bank<e_enamex> sought to
close off further discussion of those transactions, saying its
wartime gold transactions were ``the subject of a binding agreement
under international law.'' The <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Swiss National Bank<e_enamex> and the Swiss
government have resisted suggestions that the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Washington<e_enamex> agreement
should be reopened.
	   The statement pointed to steps taken by <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Switzerland<e_enamex> in the last
<b_timex type="DURATION">two years<e_timex> as pressure has increased from American Jewish
organizations, politicians, and the <b_enamex type="PERSON">Clinton<e_enamex> administration to
settle disputes with Holocaust survivors.
	   During that period, Swiss private banks, the central bank, and
some industries have set up a <b_numex type="MONEY">$180-million<e_numex> fund for needy Holocaust
survivors. An inquiry led by <b_enamex type="PERSON">Paul Volcker<e_enamex>, former chairman of the
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Federal Reserve<e_enamex>, is looking for money left in Swiss banks by
Holocaust victims and survivors. And the Swiss authorities have
established a commission of historians to investigate the overall
relationship between <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Switzerland<e_enamex> and <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Nazi<e_enamex> <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Germany<e_enamex>.
	   The pending lawsuit could well increase pressure on the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Swiss
National Bank<e_enamex> to join the settlement that is to be negotiated by
the <b_numex type="CARDINAL">three<e_numex> big private banks _ <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Credit Suisse<e_enamex>, the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Union Bank of
Switzerland<e_enamex>, and the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Swiss Bank Corp.<e_enamex> _ with class-action lawyers
and the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">World Jewish Congress<e_enamex>.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Israel Singer<e_enamex>, the secretary-general of the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">World Jewish
Congress<e_enamex>, said on <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex> that the dispute would not end until all
of the various players in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Switzerland<e_enamex> with ``things to own up to''
had done so, including the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Swiss National Bank<e_enamex>.
	   ``Each of them is going to have to realize that they are going
to have to come and conclude this process,'' he said. ``We are
building a structure, a stadium, a field of dreams. Everyone is
going to have to step up to the plate.''

<b_timex type="DATE">MARCH<e_timex> UNEMPLOYMENT RISES
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   After months in overdrive, the great American jobs engine seems
suddenly to be idling.
	   In <b_timex type="DATE">March<e_timex>, for the first time in more than <b_timex type="DURATION">two years<e_timex>, the economy
added no new jobs, the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Labor Department<e_enamex> reported on <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex>.
Payrolls edged down by <b_numex type="CARDINAL">36,000<e_numex> jobs, and the unemployment rate,
which had been at a <b_timex type="DURATION">24-year<e_timex> low, edged up to <b_numex type="PERCENT">4.7 percent<e_numex> from <b_numex type="PERCENT">4.6
percent<e_numex>. The <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Labor Department<e_enamex> also reported that <b_timex type="DATE">February<e_timex>'s job
gains were being revised downward.
	   Even though most economists were expecting job growth to
moderate, the different job market picture conveyed by <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex>'s
report caught them by surprise.
	   The department warned, however, that the report was somewhat
suspect. Last <b_timex type="DURATION">month<e_timex>'s dip in jobs _ the first since <b_timex type="DATE">January 1996<e_timex>,
when snowstorms shut down businesses in the Northeast _ may reflect
the abnormal weather patterns of the last <b_timex type="DURATION">few months<e_timex> more than real
changes in the labor market. Unseasonable cold during the survey
period last <b_timex type="DURATION">month<e_timex>, following unusually warm temperatures in <b_timex type="DATE">January<e_timex>
and <b_timex type="DATE">February<e_timex>, may have skewed the seasonal adjustments the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Labor
Department<e_enamex> makes to raw job-survey figures.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Katherine Abraham<e_enamex>, commissioner of the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Bureau of Labor
Statistics<e_enamex>, said, ``There's a lot in this report that you have to
discount.''
	   The jobs report nonetheless warmed the hearts of those investors
who welcome any sign that the labor market is cooling, particularly
those who trade bonds. The economy had been adding jobs at a pace
of more than <b_numex type="MEASURE">300,000 a month<e_numex>, fanning fears that employers were
running out of workers and leading some to declare that the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Federal
Reserve<e_enamex> might move to raise interest rates to brake growth.
	   Now, such possibilities seem more remote and stock and bond
prices responded accordingly. Stocks finished mostly higher on
<b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex>, while a rally in bonds pushed the yield on the benchmark
<b_timex type="DURATION">30-year<e_timex> <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Treasury<e_enamex> down to <b_numex type="PERCENT">5.79 percent<e_numex>, the lowest since <b_timex type="DATE">Feb. 17<e_timex>.
	   ``It's further reason for the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Fed<e_enamex> to do what it does best:
absolutely nothing,'' said <b_enamex type="PERSON">David Wyss<e_enamex>, chief economist at <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Standard
&AMP; Poor's DRI<e_enamex>.
	   On the other hand, few believe that the job market is shrinking
as abruptly as the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Labor Department<e_enamex>'s data might suggest. ``This is
nothing to worry about,'' said <b_enamex type="PERSON">Bruce Steinberg<e_enamex>, chief economist at
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch<e_enamex>.
	   Just as El Nino and unseasonably warm temperatures in <b_timex type="DATE">January<e_timex>
and <b_timex type="DATE">February<e_timex> exaggerated the job market's strength in the <b_timex type="DATE">winter<e_timex>,
the unseasonable cold in some of <b_timex type="DATE">March<e_timex> is probably exaggerating the
weakness just reported.
	   ``Large numbers of construction workers normally are laid off
during the <b_timex type="DATE">November<e_timex>-to-<b_timex type="DATE">February<e_timex> period,'' Dr. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Abraham<e_enamex> said.
``During the recent <b_timex type="DATE">winter<e_timex>, however, fewer workers than normal were
laid off. With so many construction jobs already filled,
early-<b_timex type="DATE">spring<e_timex> hiring fell short of its usual pace.''
	   Job growth averaged <b_numex type="MEASURE">205,000 a month<e_numex> this past <b_timex type="DURATION">quarter<e_timex>. That is
not as strong as the <b_numex type="MEASURE">356,000<e_numex> rate of the <b_timex type="DATE">last quarter of 1997<e_timex>, but
it is robust by any measure.
	   ``We're still probably growing above trend,'' said President
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Clinton<e_enamex>'s chief economist, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Janet L. Yellen<e_enamex>. Like most private
forecasters, she said, the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Council of Economic Advisers<e_enamex> expects job
growth to be more moderate than last <b_timex type="DURATION">year<e_timex>. ``As we go toward the
end of the year we'll be looking at numbers more in the <b_numex type="CARDINAL">hundreds<e_numex>,''
she said. ``We've gotten a little spoiled.'' A pace of <b_numex type="MEASURE">125,000 new
jobs or so a month<e_numex> would keep the unemployment rate about where it
is now.
	   The <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Labor Department<e_enamex> reported that in <b_timex type="DATE">March<e_timex>, after seasonal
adjustment, <b_numex type="CARDINAL">88,000<e_numex> jobs were lost in construction and <b_numex type="CARDINAL">43,000<e_numex> in
restaurants.
	   But some businesses tell a different story. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Mitchell Fromstein<e_enamex>,
head of <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Manpower Inc.<e_enamex>, the largest temporary-help service,
confirmed this. ``The demand for people is still very high at every
level,'' he said. ``We don't sense any downturn in our business.''
	   Similarly, home building and office construction are booming.
``We've had more and more reports from builders that their big
problem is finding qualified labor,'' said <b_enamex type="PERSON">Michael Carliner<e_enamex> at the
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">National Association of Home Builders<e_enamex>. ``We have no inclination
that there's been a decline in employment.''
	   And while <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">McDonald's<e_enamex> recently announced that it would invest in
labor-saving technology and <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Pepsico<e_enamex> is spinning off its restaurant
chains, help-wanted signs are still much in evidence at drive-in
franchise locations around the country.
	   Indeed, the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">National Federation of Independent Business<e_enamex>, which
issued its monthly survey on <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex>, reports that the No. 1 problem
facing small businesses is still finding qualified workers.
<b_numex type="PERCENT">Twenty-eight percent<e_numex> of the respondents, a near-record, said they
had job openings they could not fill.
	   The <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Labor Department<e_enamex> reported strong job gains in computer and
data processing, engineering and management services and financial
services, which are benefiting from a the boom in home buying and
stock investing.
	   Manufacturing hiring remained surprisingly strong, suggesting
that the financial crisis in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Asia<e_enamex> had not yet made its full impact
felt. Manufacturing employment, vulnerable to weakness in Asian
markets and more intense competition from lower-price Asian
imports, actually rose by <b_numex type="CARDINAL">3,000<e_numex> last <b_timex type="DURATION">month<e_timex>.
	   Total hours worked declined by <b_numex type="PERCENT">seven-tenths of 1 percent<e_numex> from
<b_timex type="DATE">February<e_timex>. But for the <b_timex type="DURATION">quarter<e_timex>, hours are still <b_numex type="PERCENT">4.9 percent<e_numex> above
last <b_timex type="DURATION">quarter<e_timex>'s level. That suggests that economic growth this
<b_timex type="DURATION">quarter<e_timex> has been fairly solid. (In the <b_timex type="DATE">fall quarter<e_timex>, hours grew <b_numex type="PERCENT">4.6
percent<e_numex>, while the gross domestic product rose <b_numex type="PERCENT">3.7 percent<e_numex>.)
	   Despite the rise in unemployment, there were still classic signs
of tightness in the labor market. Long-term unemployment _ defined
as joblessness among those who are out of work for <b_timex type="DURATION">27 weeks<e_timex> or
longer _ was at its lowest since economic expansion turned upward
in <b_timex type="DATE">1991<e_timex>. And the average duration of unemployment declined to <b_timex type="DURATION">6.8
weeks<e_timex> from <b_timex type="DURATION">7.2<e_timex>.
	   Hourly earnings rose <b_numex type="MONEY">4 cents<e_numex> last <b_timex type="DURATION">month<e_timex>, to <b_numex type="MONEY">$12.63<e_numex>. But the
previous <b_timex type="DURATION">month<e_timex>'s increase, originally reported as <b_numex type="MONEY">8 cents<e_numex>, was
revised down to <b_numex type="MONEY">6 cents<e_numex>. ``Wages aren't accelerating as fast as was
feared,'' <b_enamex type="PERSON">Wyss<e_enamex> said.

<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">SMITHSONIAN<e_enamex> FIRES ARCHITECT OF <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">NATIONAL INDIAN MUSEUM<e_enamex>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   From its inception, the concept of the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">National Museum of the
American Indian<e_enamex>, planned for the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Mall<e_enamex> in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Washington<e_enamex>, was meant to
be a design apart. American Indian elders were called in for
``vision sessions'' to guide the architects. The chief designer,
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Douglas Cardinal<e_enamex>, is of Blackfoot ancestry.
	   And soon he began to fashion a dramatic, swooping building of
rough-hewn limestone, meant to resemble cliffs carved away, with
windows aligned so that at <b_timex type="DATE">winter<e_timex> and <b_timex type="DATE">summer solstices<e_timex>, the sun's
rays would shoot in like beams to illuminate sacred objects. At the
center, he planned a circular gathering spot, or potomac, for
storytellers and dancers.
	   The museum, sitting next to the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION" status="opt">Capitol<e_enamex>, would be a symbol of
forgiveness and healing, he said.
	   But in what it called a ``drastic action,'' the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Smithsonian
Institution<e_enamex> has terminated its contract with <b_enamex type="PERSON">Cardinal<e_enamex>, a prominent
<b_numex type="MEASURE">64-year<e_numex>-old Canadian, and with his collaborators, <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">GBQC Architects<e_enamex>
of <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Philadelphia<e_enamex>, adding a serious complication to the life of the
<b_numex type="MONEY">$110 million<e_numex> project.
	   The termination, first reported this week by <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">The Washington
Post<e_enamex>, has come after a protracted period of wrangling between the
architect, who considers himself a ``warrior,'' and the museum over
delays and contractual disagreements. Last year, saying he had
``run out of resources'' because of the extra hours he was putting
in, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Cardinal<e_enamex> decided to ``make a stand,'' as he put it, by
withholding his architectural drawings, in effect holding the
project hostage.
	   Failure to deliver the working and technical drawings, as well
as procedural delays between the <b_numex type="CARDINAL">two<e_numex> firms, were major reasons for
the dismissal, <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Smithsonian<e_enamex> officials said. ``It's a step we've
taken with the greatest reluctance,'' said <b_enamex type="PERSON">David Umansky<e_enamex>, a
spokesman for the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Smithsonian Institution<e_enamex>, which had planned to
break ground on the <b_numex type="MEASURE">250,000-square-foot<e_numex> project in the <b_timex type="DATE">fall<e_timex>. ``Mr.
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Cardinal<e_enamex> did not live up to the contract. We came to the difficult
decision that we had to move on if this building was going to open
in the year <b_timex type="DATE">2002<e_timex>. We have an obligation to produce the museum with
the money we have.''
	   The <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Smithsonian<e_enamex>, he added, relies on congressional
appropriations. ``This <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Congress<e_enamex> looks very carefully on how money
is being spent.''
	   The museum says it plans to build <b_enamex type="PERSON">Cardinal<e_enamex>'s design _ which has
already passed the hurdles of approval by the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">federal Commission of
Fine Arts<e_enamex> and the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">National Capital Planning Commission<e_enamex> _ with a
successor yet to be named.
	   ``It's obviously been very painful,'' said the museum's
director, <b_enamex type="PERSON">J. Richard West<e_enamex>, a Cheyenne. ``But it is our absolute
intention to build <b_enamex type="PERSON">Douglas<e_enamex>' design, and to give him credit for it,
with continued native involvement.''
	   The dismissal, however, has angered some of the American Indian
elders who have taken part in the ``vision sessions,'' among them,
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Lloyd Kiva New<e_enamex>, president emeritus of the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Institute of American
Indian Art<e_enamex> in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Santa Fe<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">N.M.<e_enamex>
	   ``The plans for this building have been drawn by a genius Native
American artist who has taken the trouble to confer with Indians at
every step of the way,'' he said. ``We have a fantastic design
produced by a Native American. They have no ethical right to take a
man's design, whether he's Indian or Chinese. It's like letting
someone finish your painting. Why don't they recognize the
importance of allowing him to carry forth to see his design put
into place proudly?''

	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Cardinal<e_enamex> and <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">GBQC<e_enamex> are planning to appeal the decision, which
they can do until <b_timex type="DATE">April 27<e_timex>. In the meantime, the museum has hired
another architectural team _ <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">James Stewart Polshek and Partners<e_enamex> of
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">New York<e_enamex> and <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Tobey and Davis<e_enamex> of <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Reston<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Va.<e_enamex> _ to conduct a ``peer
review'' of the project, to ``see where we are,'' <b_enamex type="PERSON">Umansky<e_enamex> said.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Polshek<e_enamex> is currently renovating the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Cooper-Hewitt Museum<e_enamex> in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">New
York<e_enamex>, part of the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Smithsonian<e_enamex>, and the cultural resource center for
the Indian museum, in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Maryland<e_enamex>. There has been some speculation
that <b_enamex type="PERSON">Polshek<e_enamex> might take over the project, which he denied. But he
said that, if he did, ``we would do it to assist the federal
government in a difficult situation. I do think the building will
be completed in a way that will please <b_enamex type="PERSON">Douglas Cardinal<e_enamex>.''
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Cardinal<e_enamex>, who built a sweat lodge for himself <b_numex type="MEASURE">12 miles<e_numex> from the
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Washington Monument<e_enamex> after moving to <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Washington<e_enamex> to work on the
design, is well known in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Canada<e_enamex> for infusing his buildings with his
native experience. He is ``metis,'' a French term for mixed
ancestry; his mother was French, German and Mohawk, his father
Blackfoot, French and Ojibwa. His best-known building is the
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Museum of Civilization<e_enamex> in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Hull<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Quebec<e_enamex>, a copper-domed,
masklike structure across the river from <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Ottawa<e_enamex>. The <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Indian Museum<e_enamex>
was his first major <b_enamex type="LOCATION">U.S.<e_enamex> commission.
	   The current dispute unfolded last year, when <b_enamex type="PERSON">Cardinal<e_enamex> asked the
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Smithsonian<e_enamex> for additional reimbursement for work beyond the hours
allotted in his contract. ``They indicated to me they would make
those provisions,'' he said. The museum advanced him <b_numex type="MONEY">$150,000<e_numex>, but
by the end of the year, he said, he was ``<b_numex type="MONEY">$300,000<e_numex> in the hole.''
	   It was at that point, he said, that some of the elders advised
him to hold his drawings until the problem was resolved. With a
gift from an anonymous donor, he said, he continued the work after
he was dismissed because he ``wanted to get the project back on
track.''
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Cardinal<e_enamex> is no stranger to controversy. In the early <b_timex type="DATE">1980s<e_timex> he
made headlines in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Canada<e_enamex> when he suggested that, rather than
compromise his design for the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Canadian Civilization<e_enamex>, they
``bulldoze it back into a park.'' They did not, and it opened to
great fanfare.
	   Canadian architectural historian <b_enamex type="PERSON">Trevor Boddy<e_enamex> has written that
the unusual cast of <b_enamex type="PERSON">Cardinal<e_enamex>'s designs, which have generally been
situated in remote places, coupled with a cultivated outsider
persona, tended to keep him off the architectural A-lists.
	   ``<b_enamex type="PERSON">Douglas Cardinal<e_enamex> is a survivor,'' <b_enamex type="PERSON">Boddy<e_enamex> said in a telephone
interview, ``and he tends to be routinely underestimated. Every
single project he's done has had a crisis like this. He's a very
complex person.''
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Cardinal<e_enamex> himself, as is his wont, is trying to take the long
view. ``The elders have guided me,'' said the architect, who relies
heavily on state-of-the-art computer technology to execute his
voluptuous forms. ``They want to be sure the whole building is done
with honor, that it be a strong expression of their voice. That's
the only way the building will have power.''

FOR <b_enamex type="LOCATION">LITTLE ROCK<e_enamex>, THE BUCK STOPS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">LITTLE ROCK<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Ark.<e_enamex> _ The official position of <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Doe's Eat Place<e_enamex> _
its steakhouse walls boasting notes signed ``<b_enamex type="PERSON">Bill<e_enamex>,'' thanking the
owner for firm campaign support and tender porterhouse _ is immense
joy and relief over the dismissal of the <b_enamex type="PERSON">Paula Jones<e_enamex> case in a
courthouse right near here.
	   The unofficial position, stated by <b_enamex type="PERSON">Peter Skrivanos<e_enamex>,
contemplating a <b_timex type="DURATION">month<e_timex> or more of tables crowded with tippers on
East Coast media expense accounts: ``I was going to get a Lexus,''
he moaned.
	   Reminded by other waiters of the official position, he quickly
added that he was joking, and that his Mazda was a fine car. But a
<b_timex type="DURATION">minute<e_timex> later, <b_numex type="CARDINAL">one<e_numex> of those waiters was calculating that he was out
at least <b_numex type="MONEY">$1,000<e_numex>. The restaurant manager added that, with plans for
emergency shipments of cabernet, she had expected an extra <b_numex type="MEASURE">$10,000
a week<e_numex>.
	   From mid-<b_timex type="DATE">May<e_timex> to the end of <b_timex type="DATE">June<e_timex>, you see, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Little Rock<e_enamex> was
destined to be more popular than the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Hamptons<e_enamex> in <b_timex type="DATE">August<e_timex>. With a lot
of the same part-time residents. A news consortium, making plans on
the scale of a major party convention, already had nearly <b_numex type="CARDINAL">100<e_numex>
members who planned to send <b_numex type="CARDINAL">700<e_numex> journalists, including <b_numex type="CARDINAL">115<e_numex> from <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">NBC<e_enamex>
alone.
	   For a city of <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Little Rock<e_enamex>'s <b_numex type="CARDINAL">175,000<e_numex> population, the boon, now
lost, was even beyond the ability of civic boosters to inflate.
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Barry Travis<e_enamex>, executive director of the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Little Rock Convention and
Visitors Bureau<e_enamex>, estimated <b_numex type="MEASURE">$50,000 a day<e_numex>. But that amount would
have hardly covered hotel bills, let alone steak and cabernet.
	   By <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex>, some <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Little Rock<e_enamex> business people had decided that
escaping this onslaught helped compensate for the loss of revenues.
	   Feuds had already broken out here over the intense incubation
applied by some hotels to speed up the hatching of their counted
chickens. News organizations complained of hotels wanting <b_numex type="MONEY">tens of
thousands of dollars<e_numex> in non-refundable fees and deposits to cover
minimum-stay requirements of <b_timex type="DURATION">45 days<e_timex> beginning well before the <b_timex type="DATE">May
27<e_timex> trial date.
	   The hotels responded that, especially given the chance that the
case wouldn't reach trial, they needed the deposits to make up for
reservations they were turning away and wholesale alterations that
news organizations demanded.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Linda Ward<e_enamex>, general manager of the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Legacy Hotel<e_enamex>, whooped when
she saw the news of the dismissal. Later, stalking her hotel lobby,
she addressed those distant journalists who now would not even be
arriving. ``Go away!'' she said, waving her arms as if swatting at
a cloud of gnats.
	   Television networks seized on the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Legacy<e_enamex>, directly across from
the courthouse door, as the perfect vantage point for their
cameras. But they squawked loudly and publicly when, for each room
facing the courthouse, normally going for <b_numex type="MEASURE">$95<e_numex>, Ms. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Ward<e_enamex> proposed
charging them <b_numex type="MONEY">$15,000<e_numex> up front, plus <b_numex type="MEASURE">$250 a day<e_numex>.
	   Besides reflecting supply and demand, she said, these expenses
covered the networks' plans for remaking the rooms into a stack of
broadcast booths. Installation of panoramic, <b_numex type="MEASURE">three-fourths-inch<e_numex>
tempered glass windows, to be set on a <b_numex type="MEASURE">7-degree<e_numex> slant to reduce
glare, would have required a crane.
	   Talks with some news organizations broke down last month. Ms.
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Ward<e_enamex> said that <b_numex type="MONEY">several thousand dollars<e_numex> received in non-refundable
deposits won't compensate for business, including <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Promise Keepers<e_enamex>
conventioneers, that she lost. ``But I'd rather take the hit than
take the harassment any day,'' she said.
	   The <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Arkansas Excelsior Hotel<e_enamex> has received a publicity windfall,
of sorts. The networks displayed its soaring brick-and-glass facade
whenever they mentioned it as the scene of the president's alleged
and unwelcome advances on Mrs. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Jones<e_enamex>.
	   But indoor adventure tourism has its limits. Will a tasteful
plaque ever mark the exact room? ``I think you know the answer to
that,'' said a hotel executive.
	   <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex>, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Kathy Grayfindley<e_enamex>, the sales manager, had her aides
hitting the phones, telling frustrated callers from recent months
that the city's largest hotel could now, suddenly, make them
welcome. Ms. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Grayfindley<e_enamex> refused to confirm that the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Excelsior<e_enamex> was
among those that had exacted large deposits.
	   The loss of business extended far beyond the state's borders.
The <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Legacy<e_enamex>'s new windows had to be ordered from <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Florida<e_enamex>, and the
city planned to rent truckloads of crowd barriers from <b_enamex type="LOCATION">New Orleans<e_enamex>,
normally much wilder, to contain the throngs outside the
courthouse.
	   Many here bemoaned not just the loss of future revenues but also
time and money invested. This week, about <b_numex type="CARDINAL">30<e_numex> members of the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Little
Rock Media Consortium<e_enamex> and assisting technicians met to refine plans
for remaking the city to their liking. They planned to turn the
streets and parking lots in front of the courthouse into Presspass
Stadium, with fenced-off interview bullpens and tiered risers for
camera crews and photographers. An office building was to become a
media center with <b_numex type="CARDINAL">1,000<e_numex> new phone lines and its own deadline-ready,
fast-food franchises.
	   Just as the meeting broke up came news of the judge's decision.
The protests and groans at the offices of Mrs. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Jones<e_enamex>' lawyers
couldn't have been louder.
	   ``Absolute disappointment,'' said <b_enamex type="PERSON">William Headline<e_enamex>, the
consortium's director. ``We were all revved up. We wanted to see
this through to the end.'' <b_enamex type="PERSON">Headline<e_enamex>, a former <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">CNN Washington bureau<e_enamex>
chief, was snatched <b_timex type="DURATION">two days<e_timex> into his retirement to serve as the
media's organizer and avuncular go-between with apprehensive local
authorities. <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex> he was busy closing down his cramped office, at
a local television station, while conferring with the court to file
and compile all their big plans for handling the media hordes.
	   With Mrs. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Jones<e_enamex> intending to appeal, and almost <b_timex type="DURATION">three years<e_timex> left
in the current administration, that's just in case. ``Who knows who
else will come out of the woodwork?'' <b_enamex type="PERSON">Headline<e_enamex> said.
	   Not that the city was altogether comfortable with turning tawdry
accusations against a former governor and incumbent president into
a tourism magnet and economic development tool. ``I feel relief
that it's not happening,'' said <b_enamex type="PERSON">Travis<e_enamex> of the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Convention and
Visitors Bureau<e_enamex>. ``But if they were going to spend those dollars
somewhere, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Little Rock<e_enamex> is a good place.''

FOR <b_enamex type="PERSON">PAULA JONES<e_enamex>, APPEALS COURT IS A WILD CARD
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">WASHINGTON<e_enamex> _ If <b_enamex type="PERSON">Paula Jones<e_enamex> decides to appeal the ruling
throwing out her lawsuit against President <b_enamex type="PERSON">Clinton<e_enamex>, her case will
go before a generally conservative circuit court in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">St. Louis<e_enamex>, with
a record that could cut both ways for her case.
	   The <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals<e_enamex>, legal experts say, has
not only been consistently unhelpful to <b_enamex type="PERSON">Clinton<e_enamex>, but it has also
been generally hostile to complaints of sexual discrimination at
the workplace like the <b_numex type="CARDINAL" status="opt">one<e_numex> brought by Mrs. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Jones<e_enamex>.
	   Mrs. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Jones<e_enamex>' lawyers said <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex> that the decision on whether to
appeal the case rests solely with her and will probably be made
next week. She must appeal within <b_timex type="DURATION">30 days<e_timex> from <b_timex type="DATE">Wednesday<e_timex>, the day
when Judge <b_enamex type="PERSON">Susan Webber Wright<e_enamex> dismissed the sexual misconduct
case. Ms. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Wright<e_enamex> rejected all of the claims stemming from what Mrs.
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Jones<e_enamex> said was a <b_timex type="DATE">1991<e_timex> encounter with <b_enamex type="PERSON">Clinton<e_enamex> in a <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Little Rock<e_enamex>,
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Ark.<e_enamex>, hotel suite.
	   The judge said that even if Mrs. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Jones<e_enamex>' assertion that <b_enamex type="PERSON">Clinton<e_enamex>
made a crude sexual advance in the suite was true, there was no
evidence that it constituted sexual harassment.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Lynne Bernabei<e_enamex>, a lawyer based in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Washington<e_enamex> who specializes in
sexual harassment cases, said she believed that Ms. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Wright<e_enamex> left
little room for an appeal, adding that it was unlikely the ruling
would be overturned.
	   ``The fact that the judge gave <b_enamex type="PERSON">Paula Jones<e_enamex>' side so much leeway
in discovery proceedings to prove their case will make it that much
harder to overturn,'' Ms. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Bernabei<e_enamex> said.
	   Other legal experts said the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">8th Circuit<e_enamex> judges had created a
strong record in favor of defendants in employment discrimination
cases, which is <b_enamex type="PERSON">Clinton<e_enamex>'s role in this case.
	   ``Given that this circuit has been trying to cut back on the
ease with which people can bring these suits, you could say this
would be an easy case to affirm,'' said <b_enamex type="PERSON">Roger Goldman<e_enamex>, a law
professor at <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">St. Louis University<e_enamex>. ``But if you look at the
political side of things, that would cut in the other direction.
Almost all the judges who are not recused on this matter were
appointed by either <b_enamex type="PERSON">Bush<e_enamex> or <b_enamex type="PERSON">Reagan<e_enamex> and to the extent that politics
makes a difference, that would cut in the other direction.''
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Goldman<e_enamex> was referring to the fact that just <b_numex type="CARDINAL">three<e_numex> of the <b_numex type="CARDINAL">10<e_numex>
active judges on the appeals court have been appointed by
Democratic presidents, and <b_numex type="CARDINAL">two<e_numex> of the <b_numex type="CARDINAL">three<e_numex> have made it known they
would not participate in any cases involving <b_enamex type="PERSON">Clinton<e_enamex>.
	   A similar view to <b_enamex type="PERSON">Goldman<e_enamex>'s was offered by <b_enamex type="PERSON">Leland Ware<e_enamex> of the
same law school who has studied the appeals court's handling of
summary judgments.
	   ``The <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">8th Circuit<e_enamex> has been pretty rigorous about affirming
summary-judgment rulings in employment discrimination cases,'' <b_enamex type="PERSON">Ware<e_enamex>
said in an interview. ``This is a defendant-friendly circuit in
these kinds of cases.''
	   But he said many lawyers who practice before the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">8th Circuit<e_enamex>
believed that its judges were not favorably disposed toward
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Clinton<e_enamex>. ``That's what makes this such an interesting call,'' he
said.
	   Among the cases <b_enamex type="PERSON">Clinton<e_enamex> has lost before the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">8th Circuit<e_enamex> was <b_numex type="CARDINAL" status="opt">one<e_numex>
in which a <b_numex type="MEASURE">three-judge<e_numex> panel overruled Ms. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Wright<e_enamex> in <b_timex type="DATE">January 1996<e_timex>.
In a <b_numex type="CARDINAL">2<e_numex>-<b_numex type="CARDINAL">1<e_numex> ruling, that panel said the <b_enamex type="PERSON">Jones<e_enamex> lawsuit should not be
delayed until the end of <b_enamex type="PERSON">Clinton<e_enamex>'s tenure as president, and ordered
the case to go forward. Its decision was upheld by a unanimous
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court<e_enamex>.
	   In <b_timex type="DATE">April 1997<e_timex>, another panel voted <b_numex type="CARDINAL">2<e_numex>-<b_numex type="CARDINAL">1<e_numex> against the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">White House<e_enamex>
when it said that notes taken by government lawyers of their
conversations with <b_enamex type="PERSON">Hillary Rodham Clinton<e_enamex> could not be withheld
from <b_enamex type="PERSON">Kenneth Starr<e_enamex>, the Whitewater independent counsel.
	   And in a third case, in <b_timex type="DATE">March 1996<e_timex>, a unanimous <b_numex type="MEASURE">three-judge<e_numex>
panel ruled in favor of <b_enamex type="PERSON">Starr<e_enamex>'s expanding his investigation and
took the unusual step of removing the lower-court judge from the
case because he had spoken of his admiration for Mrs. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Clinton<e_enamex> and
had spent a <b_timex type="DURATION">night<e_timex> as a guest at the <b_enamex type="PERSON">Clinton<e_enamex> <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">White House<e_enamex>.
	   Judge <b_enamex type="PERSON">Pasco Bowman II<e_enamex>, who was appointed by President <b_enamex type="PERSON">Ronald
Reagan<e_enamex>, was a member of all <b_numex type="CARDINAL">three<e_numex> of those panels. He was also the
chief judge of the panel that overruled Ms. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Wright<e_enamex> in <b_timex type="DATE">1996<e_timex>, and
that panel could inherit any appeal from Mrs. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Jones<e_enamex>.
	   Court officials said that if for some reason the same panel did
not hear the <b_enamex type="PERSON" status="opt">Jones<e_enamex> case, the clerk would then be obliged to choose
a new <b_numex type="MEASURE">three-judge<e_numex> panel by lottery.
	   In any event, the appeals court could not hear arguments in the
case until next <b_timex type="DATE">fall<e_timex> at the earliest, some court officials said
<b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex>.

<b_enamex type="PERSON">KWAN<e_enamex> WINS SHORT PROGRAM AT SKATING CHAMPIONSHIP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">MINNEAPOLIS<e_enamex> _ With a smiling, joyous performance that bore none
of the caution she displayed at the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Nagano<e_enamex> Olympics, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Michelle Kwan<e_enamex>
decisively won the women's short program <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex> at the world figure
skating championships.
	   On an otherwise inelegant afternoon, when only <b_numex type="CARDINAL">four<e_numex> of the <b_numex type="CARDINAL">30<e_numex>
skaters delivered clean programs, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Kwan<e_enamex> received a perfect mark of <b_numex type="CARDINAL">6<e_numex>
for artistry from the Canadian judge. Inexplicably, <b_numex type="CARDINAL">one<e_numex> judge
placed <b_enamex type="PERSON">Kwan<e_enamex> second, but the other <b_numex type="CARDINAL">eight<e_numex> placed her where she
clearly belonged _ in first, over <b_enamex type="PERSON">Anna Rechnio<e_enamex> of <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Poland<e_enamex> and
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Laetitia Hubert<e_enamex> of <b_enamex type="LOCATION">France<e_enamex>.
	   Skating to a <b_enamex type="PERSON">Rachmaninoff<e_enamex> piano trio and concerto, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Kwan<e_enamex> showed
none of the deliberateness that cost her a gold medal at the Winter
Games in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Nagano<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Japan<e_enamex>, in <b_timex type="DATE">February<e_timex>. She was elegant, confident and
fast on <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex>, with exquisite position and flow in her triple
lutz-double toe combination and with a graceful, extended spiral
that drew customary applause from the audience at the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Target
Center<e_enamex>. She wobbled slightly upon landing her double axel, but
otherwise <b_enamex type="PERSON">Kwan<e_enamex> was at her self-assured best.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Tara Lipinski<e_enamex>, the Olympic gold medalist, was absent, having
withdrawn with sickness and fatigue. But <b_enamex type="PERSON">Lipinski<e_enamex> had not defeated
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Kwan<e_enamex> in a short program this season, and it was unlikely that she
could have prevailed <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex>.
	   ``Knowing that the world championships were in my home country
meant a lot,'' said <b_enamex type="PERSON">Kwan<e_enamex>, who is <b_numex type="MEASURE">17<e_numex> and lives in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Lake Arrowhead<e_enamex>,
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Calif.<e_enamex> ``When I stepped on the ice, I saw the American flags and
the banners and I wanted to give the audience the joy and freedom
that I have on the ice.''
	   <b_timex type="DATE">Saturday<e_timex>'s long program will be worth <b_numex type="CARDINAL">two-thirds<e_numex> of the scoring.
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Kwan<e_enamex> is a heavy favorite to win her second world title. Her main
challengers are the unlikely <b_enamex type="PERSON">Rechnio<e_enamex> and <b_enamex type="PERSON">Hubert<e_enamex>, who finished 19th
and 20th, respectively, at the Olympics.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Rechnio<e_enamex>, <b_numex type="MEASURE">20<e_numex>, did not even qualify for the previous <b_numex type="CARDINAL">two<e_numex> world
championships, where her best career finish is 14th. She had
trained for several seasons in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Marlboro<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Mass.<e_enamex>, but this season she
returned to <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Warsaw<e_enamex>, changed coaches, got injured and missed the
European championships. Now healthy, she landed spectacular jumps
<b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex> and vaulted into second place.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Hubert<e_enamex>, <b_numex type="MEASURE">23<e_numex>, is an all-or-nothing skater. At the <b_timex type="DATE">1992<e_timex> Winter
Games in her native <b_enamex type="LOCATION">France<e_enamex>, she fell a <b_numex type="CARDINAL">half-dozen<e_numex> times in the long
program and was nicknamed ``The Human Zamboni.'' At the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Nagano<e_enamex>
Games, she became so deflated with her poor jumping that she
appeared on the verge of stopping in the middle of her long
program. But she also defeated <b_enamex type="PERSON">Lipinski<e_enamex> at Trophy Lalique in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Paris<e_enamex>
last <b_timex type="DATE">November<e_timex>. <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex>, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Hubert<e_enamex> was <b_numex type="CARDINAL">one<e_numex> of only <b_numex type="CARDINAL">two<e_numex> skaters to land a

placed her first, ahead of <b_enamex type="PERSON">Kwan<e_enamex>.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Kwan<e_enamex>'s only problem came in the draw for <b_timex type="DATE">Saturday<e_timex>'s long

<b_enamex type="PERSON">LEWINSKY<e_enamex>'S MOTHER QUESTIONED AGAIN, BUT NOT BEFORE JURY
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">WASHINGTON<e_enamex> _ Investigators from the office of independent
counsel <b_enamex type="PERSON">Kenneth Starr<e_enamex> questioned <b_enamex type="PERSON">Monica Lewinsky<e_enamex>'s mother again
<b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex> but outside the foreboding confines of the grand jury room,
according to lawyers close to <b_enamex type="PERSON">Starr<e_enamex>'s inquiry.
	   The renewed questioning of Ms. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Lewinsky<e_enamex>'s mother, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Marcia Lewis<e_enamex>,
appeared to reflect <b_enamex type="PERSON">Starr<e_enamex>'s pledge to press on with his
investigation of whether President <b_enamex type="PERSON">Clinton<e_enamex> had a sexual
relationship with Ms. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Lewinsky<e_enamex>, a former <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">White House<e_enamex> intern, then
encouraged her and others to lie about it _ accusations that the
president has repeatedly denied.
	   At the same time, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Starr<e_enamex>'s decision to question Ms. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Lewis<e_enamex> away
from the grand jury could reflect the prosecutor's desire to avoid
a repeat of the public relations disaster of <b_timex type="DATE">February<e_timex>, when she was
so unnerved by going before the grand jury that she left in a state
of near-collapse, generating wide sympathy for herself and for her
daughter.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Starr<e_enamex>'s office did not return a telephone call seeking comment
on the questioning of Ms. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Lewis<e_enamex> and about renewed criticism of his
investigative tactics, including his subpoena of bookstore records
to determine whether <b_enamex type="PERSON">Lewinsky<e_enamex> might have given books as gifts to
the president.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">William Ginsburg<e_enamex>, Ms. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Lewinsky<e_enamex>'s lawyer, also declined comment
<b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex> on the latest questioning of Ms. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Lewis<e_enamex>. It could not be
determined what was asked and whether Ms. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Lewis<e_enamex> made any
concessions to the prosecutor in return for being spared the ordeal
of going before the grand jury again.
	   <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex>, the president was still savoring his victory of <b_timex type="DURATION">two days<e_timex>
earlier, the dismissal of <b_enamex type="PERSON">Paula Jones<e_enamex>' sexual-misconduct suit
against him, when he was asked on the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">White House<e_enamex> lawn for his
reaction to a report that <b_enamex type="PERSON">Starr<e_enamex> may change his whole strategy.
	   According to <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">U.S. News &AMP; World Report<e_enamex>, some people in <b_enamex type="PERSON">Starr<e_enamex>'s
office want the grand jury to indict Ms. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Lewinsky<e_enamex> and name the
president as an unindicted co-conspirator. That way, the findings
against <b_enamex type="PERSON">Clinton<e_enamex> would have a public airing in a courtroom, but
there would be no need to address the unanswered constitutional
issue of whether a sitting president can be indicted.
	   Other aides to <b_enamex type="PERSON">Starr<e_enamex> favor turning the evidence over to
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Congress<e_enamex>, according to the magazine, which reported on the supposed
debate in <b_enamex type="PERSON">Starr<e_enamex>'s office on the Internet. Those aides are said to
feel that leaving the president's fate to <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Congress<e_enamex> _ assuming there
is sufficient evidence to charge him _ would be the best course,
even though many political observers doubt that <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Congress<e_enamex> would
impeach <b_enamex type="PERSON">Clinton<e_enamex> in this election year, especially since he is
enjoying high ratings in the polls.
	   Asked at a news conference <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex> about the article, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Clinton<e_enamex>
declined to comment.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Starr<e_enamex> has been under mounting criticism since a federal judge in
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Little Rock<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Ark.<e_enamex>, threw out the suit by Mrs. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Jones<e_enamex>, a former
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Arkansas<e_enamex> state employee who contends that then-Governor <b_enamex type="PERSON">Clinton<e_enamex>
made a lewd proposal to her in a hotel room in <b_timex type="DATE">1991<e_timex> _ accusations
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Clinton<e_enamex> has denied.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Starr<e_enamex> has said that his investigation will go on, regardless of
the dismissal of the suit. They are separate matters, although it
has often been difficult to tell how separate.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Starr<e_enamex>'s inquiry began as an investigation into financial
dealings of <b_enamex type="PERSON">Clinton<e_enamex> and his wife, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Hillary Rodham Clinton<e_enamex>, years ago
in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Arkansas<e_enamex> and has delved in recent months into <b_enamex type="PERSON">Clinton<e_enamex>'s sexual
behavior. The people involved in the <b_enamex type="PERSON">Jones<e_enamex> suit and in the episodes
that <b_enamex type="PERSON">Starr<e_enamex> has been studying have occasionally overlapped.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Starr<e_enamex>'s attempt to learn more about Ms. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Lewinsky<e_enamex>'s book-buying
was the subject of a hearing in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Washington<e_enamex> on <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex> before <b_enamex type="LOCATION">U.S.<e_enamex>
District Judge <b_enamex type="PERSON">Norma Holloway Johnson<e_enamex>.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Starr<e_enamex> has subpoenaed the records of <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Kramerbooks and Afterwords<e_enamex>,
an independent store in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Washington<e_enamex>'s <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Dupont Circle<e_enamex> neighborhood, as
well as records from <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Barnes &AMP; Noble<e_enamex>, to review Ms. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Lewinsky<e_enamex>'s book
purchases of the past <b_timex type="DURATION">two and a half years<e_timex>. That is roughly the
time in which she is said to have told friends, including <b_numex type="CARDINAL">one<e_numex> who
taped her phone calls, that she had a relationship with <b_enamex type="PERSON">Clinton<e_enamex>.
	   <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex>'s hearing dealt only with the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Kramerbooks<e_enamex> subpoena, and
it saw lawyers for Ms. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Lewinsky<e_enamex> and for <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Kramerbooks<e_enamex> standing in
unity.
	   ``She's not been charged with anything,'' <b_numex type="CARDINAL">one<e_numex> of Ms. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Lewinsky<e_enamex>'s
lawyers, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Nathaniel Speights<e_enamex>, said, asserting that his client ``has
the right to have her privacy protected by this court.''
	   ``Our ability to read is exactly what the founding fathers had
in mind when the Bill of Rights was written,'' <b_enamex type="PERSON">Pamela Bethel<e_enamex>, a
lawyer for <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Kramerbooks<e_enamex>, argued.
	   But <b_enamex type="PERSON">Robert Bittman<e_enamex>, a lawyer from <b_enamex type="PERSON">Starr<e_enamex>'s office, said the grand
jury needed the list of purchases Ms. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Lewinsky<e_enamex> made in order to
corroborate other evidence. ``It's not the books part, it's the
exchanging of gifts that we're looking at,'' <b_enamex type="PERSON">Bittman<e_enamex> said.
	   Ms. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Johnson<e_enamex> said she would rule in about a <b_timex type="DURATION">week<e_timex>.

A VOICE, AND SPIRIT, REMEMBERED AT WRIGLEY
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">CHICAGO<e_enamex> _ With <b_numex type="CARDINAL">two<e_numex> outs in the top of the seventh inning on
<b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex> at Wrigley Field, the sold-out crowd rose to its feet and
began to cheer, eagerly anticipating the seventh-inning stretch and
a tradition made famous at this park by the legendary announcer
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Harry Caray<e_enamex>.
	   But following <b_enamex type="PERSON">Caray<e_enamex>'s death <b_timex type="DURATION">two months<e_timex> ago at <b_numex type="MEASURE">83<e_numex>, <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Cubs<e_enamex> fans
turned out at the team's home opener on <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex> to listen to his
widow, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Dutchie<e_enamex>, sing ``Take Me Out to the Ball Game,'' which her
husband had spent <b_timex type="DURATION">16 years<e_timex> crooning to the delight of adoring,
jubilant fans.
	   The cheers and chants of ``<b_enamex type="PERSON">Harry<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Harry<e_enamex>,'' grew louder and the
intensity increased so much in the seventh inning that when
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Montreal<e_enamex>'s <b_enamex type="PERSON">Chris Widger<e_enamex> hit a routine fly ball to <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Chicago<e_enamex>'s <b_enamex type="PERSON">Sammy
Sosa<e_enamex> in right field, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Sosa<e_enamex> dropped it, prolonging the wait. In the
broadcast booth, Mrs. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Caray<e_enamex> waited nervously for her debut.
	   It wasn't until after a walk of the following batter and a
pitching change that the <b_numex type="CARDINAL">half<e_numex>-inning finally ended and she assumed
the spot <b_enamex type="PERSON">Harry Caray<e_enamex> had made famous, leaning out of the booth,
microphone waving.
	   Her voice was lost among the <b_numex type="CARDINAL">39,102<e_numex> fans, all of whom were
singing along. As the song ended, balloons were released over the
field as ``Amazing Grace'' played over the loudspeakers.
	   ``He was guiding me,'' she said following her performance. ``It
was a great feeling. To see how much these fans loved <b_enamex type="PERSON">Harry<e_enamex> is just
amazing.''
	   The day was an all-out tribute to <b_enamex type="PERSON">Harry Caray<e_enamex>, whose love for
the game and eccentric personality brought fans from all over to
watch a team known for losing.
	   Indeed, his caricatured face that has come to resemble ``fun at
the old ball park,'' was omnipresent here on <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex>. His face
appeared on a patch on players' sleeves, his trademark glasses were
worn by fans, and a giant poster of him hung above his broadcast
booth, now occupied by his <b_numex type="MEASURE">33-year<e_numex>-old grandson, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Chip<e_enamex>. With a
moment of silence before the game, he was remembered by the people
he exemplified: baseball fans.
	   ``Today was a day I was looking forward to for a long time,''
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Chip Caray<e_enamex> said before the game. ``It was supposed to be the first
day my grandpa and I worked together.''
	   The <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Cubs<e_enamex> have lined up a number of celebrities to come in and
sing, including <b_enamex type="PERSON">Ernie Banks<e_enamex> on <b_timex type="DATE">Saturday<e_timex>. Also on tap: the comedian
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Jay Leno<e_enamex>, the film critic <b_enamex type="PERSON">Roger Ebert<e_enamex>, the singer <b_enamex type="PERSON">Lou Rawls<e_enamex>, the
Olympic speed-skater <b_enamex type="PERSON">Bonnie Blair<e_enamex>, and the former <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION" status="opt">Chicago Bear<e_enamex>
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Walter Payton<e_enamex>.
	   Many of the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Cubs<e_enamex> faithful would tell you that <b_enamex type="PERSON">Harry Caray<e_enamex> was
there, maybe even pulling a few strings as <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Chicago<e_enamex> beat the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Expos<e_enamex>,
<b_numex type="CARDINAL">6<e_numex>-<b_numex type="CARDINAL">2<e_numex>, improving its record to <b_numex type="CARDINAL">3<e_numex>-<b_numex type="CARDINAL">1<e_numex>. Perhaps it was the <b_numex type="MEASURE">18-mph<e_numex> wind
blowing straight in from center field (<b_enamex type="PERSON">Steve Trachsel<e_enamex>, the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Cubs<e_enamex>'
starting pitcher, led the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">National League<e_enamex> in home runs allowed last
year), or the fact that <b_enamex type="PERSON">Trachsel<e_enamex> himself had <b_numex type="CARDINAL">three<e_numex> runs batted in.
	   ``<b_enamex type="PERSON">Harry<e_enamex> would have been very happy with today,'' said <b_enamex type="PERSON">Matt Wolf<e_enamex>,
who traveled from <b_enamex type="LOCATION">North Carolina<e_enamex> with his wife, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Laura<e_enamex>, for the
game. ``We normally come up for <b_numex type="MEASURE">two<e_numex> or <b_numex type="MEASURE">three games a year<e_numex>, but we
knew we had to be here for this. It was just wild.''

	    &UR; (<b_enamex type="PERSON">Terry PACE<e_enamex> is a staff writer for the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Florence (Ala.) Times
Daily<e_enamex>. This story was distributed by <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">The N.Y. Times News Service<e_enamex>.) &LR; 
	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">FLORENCE<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Ala.<e_enamex> _ From the area's earliest movie houses to the
development of the region's first modern library, the legacy
established by <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Florence<e_enamex> businessman <b_enamex type="PERSON">Louis Rosenbaum<e_enamex> has enhanced
quality of life here for <b_numex type="CARDINAL">three<e_numex> generations.
	   As the century draws to a close, the <b_enamex type="PERSON">Rosenbaum<e_enamex> family hopes to
transform <b_numex type="CARDINAL">one<e_numex> of their long-treasured possessions _ the
Usonian-style family home designed by world-renowned architect
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Frank Lloyd Wright<e_enamex> _ into a vital cultural resource for generations
to come.
	   ``What I really want is to give the house away so that it can be
restored and maintained,'' said <b_enamex type="PERSON">Mildred Rosenbaum<e_enamex>, who has lived in
the house since its construction began in <b_timex type="DATE">1939<e_timex>. ``We don't have the
funds needed to restore the house, so we'd like to see it fully
restored and turned into a house museum that people can fully
enjoy.''
	   Plans for the transfer of the historic home are being
coordinated by her sons, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Alvin Rosenbaum<e_enamex>, a published author,
designer, regional planner and founding president of the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">National
Center for Heritage Development<e_enamex>.
	   ``This house is a very important example of American
architecture,'' maintains <b_enamex type="PERSON">Rosenbaum<e_enamex>, whose comprehensive book,
``Usonia _ Frank Lloyd Wright's Design for America,'' was published
in <b_timex type="DATE">1993<e_timex>. ``It needs to be saved and taken care of and made
available to the public.''
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Mildred Rosenbaum<e_enamex> and her husband <b_enamex type="PERSON">Stanley<e_enamex> (who died in <b_timex type="DATE">1983<e_timex>)
were young newlyweds when revolutionary modern architect <b_enamex type="PERSON">Wright<e_enamex> _
whose fame and notoriety were already reaching international
proportions _ agreed to design their modest new home at <b_enamex type="LOCATION">601
Riverview Dr.<e_enamex> in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Florence<e_enamex>.
	   In his book, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Alvin Rosenbaum<e_enamex> described <b_enamex type="PERSON">Wright<e_enamex>'s unique Usonian
concept as ``... a place where design commingled with nature,
expanding the idea of architecture to include a civilization, a
utopian ideal that integrated spiritual harmony and material
prosperity across a seamless, unspoiled landscape.'' As he
developed the <b_enamex type="PERSON">Rosenbaums<e_enamex>' future home, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Wright<e_enamex> envisioned the
structure as a prototype for his daring new approach to residential
design for middle-class Americans.
	   ``The <b_enamex type="PERSON">Rosenbaum<e_enamex> house is the purest example of the Usonian,''
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Cambridge University<e_enamex> scholar and architect <b_enamex type="PERSON">John Sargeant<e_enamex> proclaimed
in ``Frank Lloyd Wright's Usonian Houses,'' a book published in
<b_timex type="DATE">1976<e_timex>. ``It incorporates detailing improvements and combines all the
standard elements in a mature and spatially varied interior.''
	   The house has been owned by the <b_enamex type="PERSON">Rosenbaum<e_enamex> family since its
construction, and <b_enamex type="PERSON">Wright<e_enamex> has been quoted by <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Frank Lloyd Wright
Foundation<e_enamex> archivist <b_enamex type="PERSON">Bruce Brooks Pfeiffer<e_enamex> as calling the couple
``ideal clients'' who ``lived appropriately and beautifully in
their home.''
	   In a rare move, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Wright<e_enamex> himself designed an addition to the house
in <b_timex type="DATE">1945<e_timex> when their family of <b_numex type="CARDINAL">four<e_numex> sons had outgrown the space.
Today the <b_enamex type="PERSON">Rosenbaum<e_enamex> house enjoys the distinction of being the only
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Wright<e_enamex>-designed structure in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Alabama<e_enamex> and the only pre-World War II
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Wright<e_enamex> house that is still occupied by its original owner.
	   ``We showed the house to people from the very beginning, because
people just asked out of curiosity,'' <b_enamex type="PERSON">Mildred Rosenbaum<e_enamex> recalled.
``It was unlike anything this area had ever seen. They couldn't
imagine what was behind that blank wall in front. They either rang
the bell or knocked on the door and asked, `May we come in and
see?' We allowed them to for years. Then, after <b_enamex type="PERSON">Stanley<e_enamex> passed
away, I just didn't feel up to it.''
	   Since <b_timex type="DATE">1991<e_timex> _ after an open house drew an overwhelming
single-afternoon crowd of <b_numex type="CARDINAL">800<e_numex> people _ <b_enamex type="PERSON">Mildred Rosenbaum<e_enamex> has served
as a live-in curator and tale-spinning tour guide, offering
fascinating, firsthand remembrances of the house, her family and
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Wright<e_enamex> himself. Over the past <b_timex type="DURATION">seven years<e_timex>, the <b_enamex type="PERSON">Rosenbaum<e_enamex> House has
been visited by close to <b_numex type="CARDINAL">5,000<e_numex> tourists representing <b_numex type="CARDINAL">48<e_numex> states and
<b_numex type="CARDINAL">20<e_numex> foreign countries.
	   ``These people came to see the <b_enamex type="PERSON">Rosenbaum<e_enamex> House,'' <b_enamex type="PERSON">Alvin
Rosenbaum<e_enamex> noted, ``but they also came to be a part of the W.C.
Handy Music Festival, or to see <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Wilson Dam<e_enamex>, to fish or swim, to
stay overnight or to spend part of their family vacation here in
the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Shoals<e_enamex>. Those things have a tremendous economic impact on an
area _ much more than they're usually given credit for.''
	   With that in mind, the family hopes to see the proposed
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Rosenbaum<e_enamex> house museum developed in conjunction with a broad-based
community partnership focusing on the benefits of cultural tourism.
Supporters say the restoration of the <b_enamex type="PERSON">Rosenbaum<e_enamex> house will be
accompanied by the development of educational and cultural-outreach
programs.
	   In <b_timex type="DATE">January<e_timex>, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Mildred<e_enamex> and <b_enamex type="PERSON">Alvin Rosenbaum<e_enamex> discussed the future of
the house with representatives of the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Florence<e_enamex>-based <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Frank Lloyd
Wright Rosenbaum House Foundation<e_enamex> as well as local leaders in
business, education, tourism, historic preservation and the arts.
Since that time, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Alvin Rosenbaum<e_enamex> has been engaged in assembling a
planning team and soliciting support for the project from potential
funding sources across the country.
	   ``Initially, I've had substantial expressions of interest and
some very good responses,'' he said. ``However, I think that there
is a truism that national foundations and funding sources are only
available to the extent that there is local commitment. These days,
public-sector support is not as important as individual people. And
the issue is not just financial. It involves partnerships and
cooperative relationships with other organizations, so that we're
not duplicating efforts that are already being done.''
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Alvin Rosenbaum<e_enamex> believes his family's cherished home _ which
celebrates its landmark 60th anniversary next year _ can be
developed as ``the hub for a region-wide heritage initiative'' that
encompasses all of the cultural attractions in the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Shoals<e_enamex> _ from
the <b_enamex type="PERSON">Helen Keller<e_enamex> birthplace in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Tuscumbia<e_enamex> to the Renaissance Tower
in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Florence<e_enamex> as well as the various gospel sings, barbecue suppers
and bass-fishing tournaments that define the area's local color.
	   ``Just doing the project isn't enough,'' <b_enamex type="PERSON">Rosenbaum<e_enamex> added. ``You
have to do it in such a way that it's sustainable and part of an
overall plan for the entire area. I just talked to my <b_numex type="MEASURE">7-year<e_numex>-old on
the phone. When he's <b_numex type="MEASURE">67<e_numex>, the house needs to be here, pristine,
telling the story that's part of his life.''
	   For his recent return to the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Shoals<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Rosenbaum<e_enamex> was joined by <b_enamex type="PERSON">J.
Jackson Walter<e_enamex>, who served as president of the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">National Trust for
Historic Preservation<e_enamex> for <b_timex type="DURATION">seven years<e_timex>. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Walter<e_enamex>, who <b_enamex type="PERSON">Rosenbaum<e_enamex>
insists ``wrote the book on how historic preservation is now
practiced in the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">United States<e_enamex>,'' is helping the family organize a
steering committee for the Campaign to Save the <b_enamex type="PERSON">Rosenbaum<e_enamex> House.
	   ``I came predisposed to the proposition that the house should be
preserved,'' admitted <b_enamex type="PERSON">Walter<e_enamex>, who now heads the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Waterford
Foundation<e_enamex> in historic <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Waterford<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Va.<e_enamex>, a town that has been
designated as a National Historic Landmark. ``Now that I've been
here, what's interesting to me is the actual context _ the way this
house and this family fit into the history of this area. There's so
much here _ from the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">TVA<e_enamex> story to the music industry _ and it's a
very interesting mix. I suspect that the restoration of this house
will have a catalytic effect on the understanding of the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Muscle
Shoals<e_enamex> area and how it presents itself to the larger public.''
	   On a personal level, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Alvin Rosenbaum<e_enamex> wants the restoration of
the house to continue a long-standing family tradition of
``building the character of this community.'' His grandfather,
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Louis Rosenbaum<e_enamex>, introduced movies to the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Shoals<e_enamex> and helped support
institutions ranging from churches to libraries. His father,
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Stanley Rosenbaum<e_enamex>, retired from the movie-theater business and
launched an even more fulfilling career as a professor of English
literature at the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">University of North Alabama<e_enamex>.
	   ``My father was an educator, and as anyone who's visited here
can tell you, books practically hold the house up,'' <b_enamex type="PERSON">Rosenbaum<e_enamex>
observed. ``This house was full of college students and other
friends talking about ideas, enjoying an intellectual atmosphere
and participating in a certain quality that this house eked out of
people. That, to me, is the most important part of the legacy.''
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Rosenbaum<e_enamex> also considers the restoration project a tribute to
the spirit and dedication of his mother, who turned <b_numex type="MEASURE">80<e_numex> last year
and continues to conduct public tours of the house _ by appointment
only _ on a regular basis. Just last month, the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Alabama Bureau of
Tourism and Travel<e_enamex> named <b_enamex type="PERSON">Mildred Rosenbaum<e_enamex> among <b_numex type="CARDINAL">12<e_numex> of ``<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Alabama<e_enamex>'s
Unforgettable Faces'' _ an honor citing individuals who ``make a
very positive impression'' on visitors to the state.
	   ``Certainly the house without <b_enamex type="PERSON">Mimi<e_enamex> is not the same thing as the
house with her,'' <b_enamex type="PERSON">Alvin Rosenbaum<e_enamex> admits. ``She will be involved in
every aspect of this so long as she is able to be involved _ which
I would predict is to her dying day. I hope that's not for a long
time.''

RAIN DELAYS FIRST DAY OF DAVIS CUP MATCHES
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">STONE MOUNTAIN<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Ga.<e_enamex> _ Those tennis fans intrepid enough to brave
severe thunderstorms in hopes of viewing Day 1 of the first-round
Davis Cup encounter between the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">United States<e_enamex> and <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Russia<e_enamex> wound up
pocketing their soggy American flags and unfurling umbrellas <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex>
afternoon at the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">International Tennis Center<e_enamex>.
	   An official washout was declared about <b_timex type="TIME">4:30 p.m.<e_timex> and both
singles matches were postponed until <b_timex type="DATE">Saturday<e_timex> because the team
captains refused to start a match under the lights. 
	   ``The guys like to acclimate to the conditions, and nobody has
hit <b_numex type="CARDINAL">one<e_numex> practice ball at night under the lights,'' said <b_enamex type="PERSON">Tom
Gullikson<e_enamex>, the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">U.S.<e_enamex> captain who admitted he would have preferred to
play the doubles on <b_timex type="DATE">Saturday<e_timex> following the <b_numex type="CARDINAL">two<e_numex> singles, a scenario
the Russians rejected.
	   A pair of former French Open champions, 53rd-ranked <b_enamex type="PERSON">Jim Courier<e_enamex>,
who is backing <b_enamex type="PERSON">Andre Agassi<e_enamex> in singles, and sixth-ranked <b_enamex type="PERSON">Yevgeny
Kafelnikov<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Russia<e_enamex>'s nonsecret weapon for singles and doubles, were

will play <b_timex type="DATE">Sunday<e_timex> morning, and the <b_numex type="CARDINAL">two<e_numex> reverse singles matches will,

countries once doubles has been played.

A WORLD TRADE CENTER BOMBER GETS <b_timex type="DURATION">240 YEARS<e_timex>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">NEW YORK<e_enamex> _ <b_enamex type="PERSON">Eyad Ismoil<e_enamex>, the man who drove a rental van loaded
with a homemade bomb into the World Trade Center garage in <b_timex type="DATE">1993<e_timex> and
helped cause the explosion that killed <b_numex type="CARDINAL">six<e_numex> people and injured
<b_numex type="CARDINAL">hundreds<e_numex> more, was sentenced on <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex> to <b_timex type="DURATION">240 years<e_timex> in prison.
	   In handing down the sentence, Judge <b_enamex type="PERSON">Kevin T. Duffy<e_enamex> of <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">U.S.
District Court<e_enamex> in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Manhattan<e_enamex> rejected <b_enamex type="PERSON">Ismoil<e_enamex>'s contention that he
had not received a fair trial, as well as his lawyer's argument
that <b_enamex type="PERSON">Ismoil<e_enamex> was not a knowing participant in the bombing plot when
he was recruited into the conspiracy by <b_enamex type="PERSON">Ramzi Yousef<e_enamex>, who was
convicted along with him in <b_timex type="DATE">November<e_timex>.
	   ``What you did was a sneak attack,'' <b_enamex type="PERSON">Duffy<e_enamex> said. ``What you did
was to kill innocents. What you sought to do was to kill
innocents.''
	   The judge also imposed a <b_numex type="MONEY">$250,000<e_numex> fine, and ordered <b_enamex type="PERSON">Ismoil<e_enamex> to
pay <b_numex type="MONEY">$10 million<e_numex> in restitution _ ``just to make sure that you never
make a <b_numex type="MONEY">dime<e_numex> out of this,'' he said.
	   During the proceeding, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Ismoil<e_enamex>, the last of <b_numex type="CARDINAL">six<e_numex> defendants
convicted of carrying out the bombing plot, continued to assert his
innocence.
	   ``Jail me, and you will add <b_numex type="CARDINAL">one<e_numex> number to the wrong list,'' he
said. ``But don't think that you will ever rest, because tyrants
always end up in trouble.''
	   He said that the charges were false and that they would ``fade
like a bubble.''
	   ``In this world,'' he said, ``a fair trial is always rare.''
	   The judge dismissed his contention. ``You have received an
extraordinarily fair trial, something which was done not as a show
trial but to give you the opportunity to put forward whatever you
wanted to do,'' he said.
	   Under the rules of the federal system, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Ismoil<e_enamex> will not be
eligible for parole, and is likely to spend the rest of his life in
prison. His sentence matches the <b_timex type="DURATION">240-year<e_timex>-terms imposed on the <b_numex type="CARDINAL">five<e_numex>
other men convicted in the bombing.
	   The <b_enamex type="LOCATION">U.S.<e_enamex> attorney in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Manhattan<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Mary Jo White<e_enamex>, whose office
prosecuted the case, said the sentence ``once again sends a clear
message that this country will respond to terrorist acts with the
full force of the law.''
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Ismoil<e_enamex> did not testify in the trial, but his lawyer, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Louis R.
Aidala<e_enamex>, often sought to distance his client from <b_enamex type="PERSON">Yousef<e_enamex>, portraying
him as a naive <b_numex type="MEASURE">21-year<e_numex>-old Jordanian who came to the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">United States<e_enamex>
to get an education and a job, and got swept into the conspiracy.
	   He said there was no evidence that <b_enamex type="PERSON">Ismoil<e_enamex> was a religious or
political fanatic, like <b_enamex type="PERSON">Yousef<e_enamex>. Prosecutors said <b_enamex type="PERSON">Ismoil<e_enamex> was working
in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Texas<e_enamex> when he was called by <b_enamex type="PERSON">Yousef<e_enamex> and asked to help in the
plot.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Ismoil<e_enamex> told authorities after his arrest that he believed he was
transporting boxes of soap into the World Trade Center garage as
part of a business deal, the jury was told.
	   During <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex>'s proceeding, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Aidala<e_enamex> again questioned whether
there was sufficient evidence that <b_enamex type="PERSON">Ismoil<e_enamex> knew he was participating
in a bombing.
	   Assistant <b_enamex type="LOCATION">U.S.<e_enamex> Attorney <b_enamex type="PERSON">David Kelley<e_enamex> argued that the jury had
made fair conclusions from the circumstantial evidence.
	   The judge agreed and then echoed statements that he had made in
sentencing <b_enamex type="PERSON">Yousef<e_enamex> in <b_timex type="DATE">January<e_timex>, when he said that the convicted
terrorist had worshiped the god of ``death and destruction.''
	   ``You were like <b_enamex type="PERSON">Ramzi Yousef<e_enamex> because your god was evil,'' the
judge told <b_enamex type="PERSON">Ismoil<e_enamex> on <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex>. ``I am not talking about an evil god;
I am talking about the personification of evil.''

<b_enamex type="LOCATION">NEW YORK<e_enamex> PLEASED BY <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">HOUSE<e_enamex> BILL ON TRANSPORT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">WASHINGTON<e_enamex> _ When the dust settled this week after the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">House<e_enamex>
passed its mammoth <b_numex type="MONEY">$217 billion<e_numex>, <b_timex type="DURATION">six-year<e_timex> highway bill, most <b_enamex type="LOCATION">New
York<e_enamex> lawmakers walked away ecstatic about the <b_numex type="MONEY">millions<e_numex> they managed
to reap for their state.
	   The bill has <b_numex type="PERCENT">47 percent<e_numex> more for <b_enamex type="LOCATION">New York<e_enamex> state than did the
last highway bill, passed in <b_timex type="DATE">1991<e_timex>, including <b_numex type="MONEY">$652.2 million<e_numex> from a
<b_numex type="MONEY">$9 billion<e_numex> provision for special projects.
	   <b_numex type="CARDINAL">One<e_numex> clear reason for the increase is simple politics: The <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">House
Transportation Committee<e_enamex> includes <b_numex type="CARDINAL">five<e_numex> <b_enamex type="LOCATION">New York<e_enamex> members, <b_numex type="CARDINAL">four<e_numex> of
them <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Republicans<e_enamex>.
	   The sums could change once members of the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">House<e_enamex> and <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Senate<e_enamex> meet
to work out the differences in their <b_numex type="CARDINAL">two<e_numex> bills, including the fate
of all the special projects, but legislators are optimistic.
	   ``<b_enamex type="LOCATION">New York<e_enamex> fared a heck of a lot better than we had any reason
to expect,'' said Rep. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Jerrold Nadler<e_enamex>, D-<b_enamex type="LOCATION">New York City<e_enamex>.
	   Most of the <b_numex type="MONEY">millions<e_numex> in special projects would go toward
much-needed asphalt-and-steel staples, like highway construction,
bridges, parking lots and bus stations, but the bill also includes
<b_numex type="MONEY">$40 million<e_numex> for a new <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Staten Island<e_enamex> ferry in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">New York City<e_enamex>.
	   Legislation of such mammoth proportions always covers a few
unusual projects. For example, the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Calspan University of Buffalo
Research Center<e_enamex>, a nonprofit organization run jointly with the
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">State University at Buffalo, N.Y.<e_enamex>, would receive <b_numex type="MONEY">$12 million<e_numex> to
help create the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Center for Transportation Injury Research<e_enamex>. The
center, according to a recent news release, will work to ``find
ways to get the right type of emergency response to an accident
scene more quickly.''
	   The cries of a small band of vocal opponents of big spending did
little to temper the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">House<e_enamex>'s overall enthusiasm for the bill, which
passed <b_numex type="CARDINAL">337<e_numex>-<b_numex type="CARDINAL">80<e_numex>.
	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">New York City<e_enamex> would see <b_numex type="CARDINAL">dozens<e_numex> of improvements. <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Houston Street<e_enamex>,
for <b_numex type="CARDINAL" status="opt">one<e_numex>, would be given wider sidewalks and improved stoplights at
a cost of <b_numex type="MONEY">$2 million<e_numex>. The <b_enamex type="LOCATION">79th Street<e_enamex> traffic circle off the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">West
Side Highway<e_enamex> would be rebuilt for <b_numex type="MONEY">$9 million<e_numex>, and the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Frederick
Douglass Circle<e_enamex> at the northwest corner of <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Central Park<e_enamex> would be
improved, for <b_numex type="MONEY">$14.65 million<e_numex>.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Nadler<e_enamex> arranged for <b_numex type="MONEY">$19 million<e_numex> for barge companies carrying
rail freight cars across the harbor between <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Brooklyn<e_enamex> and <b_enamex type="LOCATION">New
Jersey<e_enamex>.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Nadler<e_enamex> also had <b_numex type="MONEY">$24 million<e_numex> included for a study of the cost of
digging a tunnel to replace the elevated section of the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Gowanus
Expressway<e_enamex>, which residents call an eyesore.
	   Members of <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Congress<e_enamex> ``know what their districts need as well as
or better than anyone else,'' <b_enamex type="PERSON">Nadler<e_enamex> said. ``When members go home
and they say I got this or that, they better be reasonable projects
or they will be criticized back home for it.''
<ANNOTATION>
	   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
	   Overall, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">New York<e_enamex> did well. In addition to the money for special
projects, the state would receive <b_numex type="MONEY">$7.34 billion<e_numex> for mass transit
and <b_numex type="MONEY">$10.57 billion<e_numex> for highways. But it was the special projects
that most interested members of <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Congress<e_enamex>.
	   Rep. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Sherwood Boehlert<e_enamex>, R-<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Utica<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">N.Y.<e_enamex>, who is the fourth-
ranking member of the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">House Transportation Committee<e_enamex>, secured the
most money in the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">New York<e_enamex> delegation, bringing back <b_numex type="MONEY">$65 million<e_numex>
for new roads, bridges and an assortment of other projects.
	   ``I take great pride that I come out No. 1,'' <b_enamex type="PERSON">Boehlert<e_enamex> said.
``It's not just a back-of-the-envelope exercise in the chairman's
office in the wee hours of the evening. This was <b_timex type="DURATION">two years<e_timex> in the
making.''
	   The lone <b_enamex type="LOCATION">New York<e_enamex> congressman to oppose the measure, Rep. <b_enamex type="PERSON">John
LaFalce<e_enamex>, D-<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Buffalo<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">N.Y.<e_enamex>, said he voted against it to protest its
conspicuous largesse. Critics said the bill threatened to bust the
federal budget, which was finally balanced last year, and cut into
important domestic programs.
	   <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">House<e_enamex> and <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Senate<e_enamex> negotiators have yet to decide where to make
the cuts, although the bill's drafters and supporters say that gas
taxes will pay for the special projects.
	   ``We experience the gain now, but we don't decide who
experiences the pain later,'' <b_enamex type="PERSON">LaFalce<e_enamex> said. ``That's not prudent.
That's not fiscal discipline.''
	   The biggest items usually involve roads and bridges. <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Buffalo<e_enamex>,
for example, would get <b_numex type="MONEY">$16 million<e_numex> for a new outer harbor bridge,
courtesy of Rep. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Jack Quinn<e_enamex>, R-<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Buffalo<e_enamex>, a member of the
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Committee<e_enamex>. The <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Grand Concourse<e_enamex> in the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Bronx<e_enamex>, in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">New
York City<e_enamex>, would get a redesigned look to ``enhance traffic flow''
for another <b_numex type="MONEY">$16 million<e_numex>.
	   In <b_enamex type="PERSON">Boehlert<e_enamex>'s upstate <b_enamex type="LOCATION">New York<e_enamex> district, the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Utica<e_enamex> to <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Rome<e_enamex>
expressway in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Oneida County<e_enamex> would be improved for <b_numex type="MONEY">$20 million<e_numex>.
	   Universities even got on the list. <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Fordham<e_enamex> would get <b_numex type="MONEY">$2 million<e_numex>
for a large parking lot that is near bus and rail stations.
	   And there is <b_numex type="MONEY">$12 million<e_numex> for the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">State University at Buffalo<e_enamex>'s
little-known <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">National Center for Earthquake Engineering Research<e_enamex>.
The center plans to use the money to conduct research to reduce the
``seismic vulnerability of the national highway system.''

COMMENTARY: FOR WORKERS, THE DREAM MARCHES ON
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">NEW YORK<e_enamex> _ <b_enamex type="PERSON">Moe Foner<e_enamex> sat in the glow of sunshine inside his
office, where papers, posters and plaques were scattered about. He
was on the phone or, more accurately, on hold, waiting for a
car-service dispatcher to get back to him. A heart condition and
walking pneumonia make it hard for him to get around.
	   ``I can't take public transportation,'' he said, his patience
wearing a bit thin. ``Oh, I'll do it some other time.'' He hung up
and rooted around the papers on his desk. ``You know about the
rally on <b_timex type="DATE">Saturday<e_timex>?'' he asked, holding out a flier plucked from the
pile. On it was a picture of the Rev. Dr. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Martin Luther King Jr.<e_enamex>
above the words ``We March to Keep His Dream Alive.''
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Foner<e_enamex>, <b_numex type="MEASURE">82<e_numex>, may not be able to do much marching these days, but
he does what he can to fulfill the last <b_numex type="CARDINAL">half<e_numex> of that declaration.
For decades he was second in command at <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">1199<e_enamex>, the hospital workers
union, witnessing a tumultuous era when it went from representing
drugstore clerks and pharmacists to winning collective bargaining
rights for <b_numex type="CARDINAL">thousands<e_numex> of low-paid, behind-the-scenes workers at
nonprofit hospitals.
	   In those rocky times, <b_enamex type="PERSON">King<e_enamex> was a steadfast supporter of what he
called his ``favorite union'' and the ``moral conscience of the
labor movement.''
	   Today, <b_timex type="DURATION">30 years<e_timex> after <b_enamex type="PERSON">King<e_enamex> was assassinated in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Memphis<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Tenn.<e_enamex>,
people may recall what the civil-rights leader did for the cause of
racial equality. But people like <b_enamex type="PERSON">Foner<e_enamex> will never forget what he
did for organized labor, a struggle that <b_enamex type="PERSON">King<e_enamex> cast in terms of
human rights and dignity.
	   ``Some people know very little about Dr. <b_enamex type="PERSON">King<e_enamex>,'' said <b_enamex type="PERSON">Foner<e_enamex>, who
directs the union's Bread and Roses project, which takes culture to
the work place. ``<b_enamex type="PERSON">King<e_enamex> was involved with many unions. When he was
shot down in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Memphis<e_enamex>, he was supporting the sanitation workers, who
were on strike. But his association with us was special.''
	   When the <b_numex type="CARDINAL">two<e_numex> men met in <b_timex type="DATE">1959<e_timex>, the union was trying to organize
in <b_numex type="CARDINAL">seven<e_numex> hospitals, despite the obstacles posed by reluctant
managers and laws that excluded employees of nonprofit hospitals
from labor laws.
	   ``They were at the bottom of the ladder,'' <b_enamex type="PERSON">Foner<e_enamex> recalled.
``They received <b_numex type="MEASURE">$26 a week<e_numex> and had no protection. Everybody said to
us: Don't touch the hospitals. The workers won't stick together
because they're poor. Even assuming you get a majority, the
hospitals don't have to agree to an election. And if you go on
strike, all you'll get is injunctions, jailings and fines.''
	   Although the hospital workers were receptive to the union's
overtures, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Foner<e_enamex> and his colleagues decided they needed to open
another front in their campaign. They suspected that organizing
low-paid minority workers would not be enough to sway the boards
that ran the institutions.
	   ``We had to get the public's support, so that could have a moral
effect on management,'' he said. ``You're dealing with trustees of
hospitals that can call up and speak to the mayor and governor. The
Who's Who of <b_enamex type="LOCATION">America<e_enamex>, those people.''
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">King<e_enamex> knew about the union, and <b_enamex type="PERSON">Foner<e_enamex> was invited to meet with
him at the home of <b_enamex type="PERSON">Stanley Levison<e_enamex>, a <b_enamex type="LOCATION">New York<e_enamex> businessman who was
a close adviser to <b_enamex type="PERSON">King<e_enamex>. At that meeting, <b_enamex type="PERSON">King<e_enamex> offered to write a
letter of support which the union widely circulated. By <b_timex type="DATE">1962<e_timex>, when
the union was lobbying to amend state laws to allow collective
bargaining for hospital workers, <b_enamex type="PERSON">King<e_enamex> called Gov. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Nelson
Rockefeller<e_enamex> <b_numex type="CARDINAL">three<e_numex> times to urge his support.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">King<e_enamex> often visited with union members and officials, and his
last major speech in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">New York City<e_enamex> was at a union rally the month
before he was killed. In it, he boasted that he considered himself
``a fellow <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">1199<e_enamex>-er.''
	   He mentioned that any talk of urban unrest and ``long, hot
summers,'' should also consider what was done during the ``long,
cold winters'' that preceded them. He talked about how people
worked full-time jobs for part-time pay.
	   ``People are always talking about menial labor,'' he told the
audience. ``But no labor is really menial unless you're not getting
adequate wages.''
	   <b_timex type="DURATION">Three and a half weeks<e_timex> later, he was dead.
	   The union he helped is now the city's largest, and its
headquarters bears his name. Not that <b_enamex type="PERSON">Foner<e_enamex> needs any reminders.
He'll be at <b_timex type="DATE">Saturday<e_timex>'s rally, even if walking a block leaves him
short of breath.
	   ``Labor has to show it's really interested in people,'' he said.
``There are remarkable people around. You shouldn't have to wait
until they die to tell them.''

	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">NEW YORK<e_enamex> _ It was easier for <b_enamex type="PERSON">Chris Childs<e_enamex> to be with the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Nets<e_enamex>
<b_timex type="DURATION">two years<e_timex> ago. Less pressure, no hype. Having freedom from
expectation meant wowing everyone as a playmaking guard with a
freewheeling style.
	   He lost his anonymity that <b_timex type="DATE">summer<e_timex> when he signed a <b_numex type="MONEY">$24 million<e_numex>
deal with the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Knicks<e_enamex>. He went just across the river, but to another
world, as a high-profile point guard. He has been adjusting ever
since.
	   This injury-riddled season, in which he went from starter to
backup, has been particularly difficult and increasingly dreadful
for <b_enamex type="PERSON">Childs<e_enamex>. In his last <b_numex type="CARDINAL">three<e_numex> games, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Childs<e_enamex> has made <b_numex type="CARDINAL">four<e_numex> of <b_numex type="CARDINAL">17<e_numex>
shots and committed <b_numex type="CARDINAL">seven<e_numex> turnovers in <b_timex type="DURATION">68 minutes<e_timex> of playing time.
	   ``I'm not happy with the way I'm playing,'' <b_enamex type="PERSON">Childs<e_enamex> said after an
<b_numex type="CARDINAL">0<e_numex>-for-<b_numex type="CARDINAL">2<e_numex>, <b_numex type="MEASURE">three-turnover<e_numex> performance against the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles
Clippers<e_enamex> on <b_timex type="DATE">Thursday<e_timex> night. ``I'm not getting the ball to the
basket. My leg is not hurting as much as it did before, so I've got
to get there. I'm going to play my game on <b_timex type="DATE">Saturday<e_timex>.''
	   If he does, his return to the <b_enamex type="PERSON">Childs<e_enamex> of old will take place
<b_timex type="DATE">Saturday<e_timex> night at Continental Arena, where he was so comfortable
with the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Nets<e_enamex>. As much as <b_enamex type="PERSON">Childs<e_enamex> has struggled as a <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Knick<e_enamex> _ not
clicking with either the <b_enamex type="PERSON">Patrick Ewing<e_enamex>-oriented offense or the
current one without the injured center _ he is only <b_numex type="CARDINAL">half<e_numex> of the
point guard problem.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Charlie Ward<e_enamex>, the starter, has also hit a season-low lull. At
times, he has been clutch in his shots and smart in his passes off
penetration. But over the same <b_numex type="CARDINAL">three<e_numex> games that <b_enamex type="PERSON">Childs<e_enamex>' game has
worsened, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Ward<e_enamex>'s shooting has been worse. He has made <b_numex type="CARDINAL">one<e_numex> of <b_numex type="CARDINAL">15<e_numex>
shots and is <b_numex type="CARDINAL">0<e_numex> for <b_numex type="CARDINAL">5<e_numex> from <b_numex type="MEASURE">3-point<e_numex> range.
	   ``I'm not really worried about their scoring,'' <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Knicks<e_enamex> coach
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Jeff Van Gundy<e_enamex> said. ``<b_enamex type="PERSON">Charlie<e_enamex> is aggressive and looks for other
guys. We just want to make sure he maintains the right balance and
takes his own shot when he's open.
	   ``<b_enamex type="PERSON">Chris<e_enamex> has got to play through it and keep working.''
	   That means doing the extra shooting <b_enamex type="PERSON">Van Gundy<e_enamex> has been banging
the drum for lately. As a team, particularly in the backcourt over
the last <b_timex type="DURATION">week<e_timex>, the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Knick<e_enamex> players' shots have fallen hard on the
rim. Now is not the time for an offensive swoon, not when the
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Knicks<e_enamex> are trying to hold fast to a playoff position. Teams like
the eighth-place <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Nets<e_enamex> are in the chase for the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Knicks<e_enamex>' No. 7 spot
in the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Eastern Conference<e_enamex>.
	   ``Before, we were in the favorite's position,'' said <b_enamex type="PERSON">Van Gundy<e_enamex>,
whose team held a <b_numex type="MEASURE">three-and-a-half-game<e_numex> lead over the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Nets<e_enamex>. ``They
were always the underdog. I think that's all changed.''
	   So much has changed since <b_enamex type="PERSON">Childs<e_enamex> was with the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Nets<e_enamex>. With the
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Knicks<e_enamex>, it is not so easy to be himself.
	   ``I was brought here for other aspects of my game; I've got to
show that,'' said <b_enamex type="PERSON">Childs<e_enamex>, who admits the ankle that he sprained <b_timex type="DURATION">six
weeks<e_timex> ago is not what is bothering him now. ``I've been stagnate,
not playing my game. That is going to end on <b_timex type="DATE">Saturday<e_timex>.''
	   REBOUNDS
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Patrick Ewing<e_enamex> continued to go through shooting drills <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex> at
practice and ran through some plays with the team. A team official
said <b_timex type="DATE">Thursday<e_timex> night that <b_enamex type="PERSON">Ewing<e_enamex> is expected to return to a
full-contact practice within <b_timex type="DURATION">10 days<e_timex>, the final step for a return
before the playoffs. ``I expect he'll practice before the end of
the season at some point,'' <b_enamex type="PERSON">Jeff Van Gundy<e_enamex> said <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex> before
describing <b_enamex type="PERSON">Ewing<e_enamex>'s workout. ``When we went contact, he didn't play.
If he's able to, contact would be the next step. It would be a huge
step.''
	   Barring a setback to his surgically repaired shooting wrist,
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Ewing<e_enamex> could be in uniform for <b_numex type="CARDINAL">one<e_numex> of the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Knicks<e_enamex>' final
regular-season games. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Ewing<e_enamex>'s touch was in full view before the
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Knicks<e_enamex>' <b_numex type="CARDINAL">81<e_numex>-<b_numex type="CARDINAL">70<e_numex> victory over the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Clippers<e_enamex> on <b_timex type="DATE">Thursday<e_timex>, when he shot
<b_numex type="MEASURE">10<e_numex>- to <b_numex type="MEASURE">18-foot<e_numex> jumpers for about <b_timex type="DURATION">half an hour<e_timex> and looked
surprisingly smooth in his release.

	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">OAKLAND<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Calif.<e_enamex> _ <b_enamex type="PERSON">Joe Torre<e_enamex>'s <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Yankee<e_enamex> cap was tilted back high on
his forehead after <b_timex type="DATE">Thursday<e_timex> night's <b_numex type="CARDINAL">10<e_numex>-<b_numex type="CARDINAL">2<e_numex> loss to the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Angels<e_enamex> in
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Anaheim<e_enamex>, a dumbfounded expression overwhelming his face. With a
beer in his hand, he could have been a dead ringer for <b_enamex type="PERSON">Walter
Matthau<e_enamex> as the manager of the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Bad News Bears<e_enamex>.
	   ``They kicked our rears,'' <b_enamex type="PERSON">Torre<e_enamex> said. ``We didn't help matters
any.''
	   The <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Yankees<e_enamex> can blame El Nino. They can blame the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">American
League<e_enamex> schedule. They can blame themselves. Regardless, they
arrived here <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex> after having lost the first <b_numex type="CARDINAL">two<e_numex> games of a
season of high hopes with a toothless offensive attack and
sometimes brainless play on defense.
	   ``It was an ugly game,'' said <b_enamex type="PERSON">David Cone<e_enamex>, who makes his first
start <b_timex type="DATE">Saturday<e_timex> against <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Oakland<e_enamex>. ``An ugly way to lose; it was
embarrassing. It was the type of game that you hope could be a
wake-up call.
	   ``Nonetheless, I still like this team.''
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Derek Jeter<e_enamex>, the shortstop, reiterated what <b_enamex type="PERSON">Torre<e_enamex> had mentioned,
that the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Yankees<e_enamex>' preparation was affected by the El Nino-driven
rain last weekend in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">San Diego<e_enamex>, all the hours of batting and
infield practice washed away. <b_enamex type="PERSON">George Steinbrenner<e_enamex>, the principal
owner, said <b_timex type="DATE">Thursday<e_timex> he would request that his team open at Yankee
Stadium next season.
	   The <b_timex type="DATE">1997<e_timex> opener was indoors, in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Seattle<e_enamex>. The <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Yankees<e_enamex> went <b_numex type="CARDINAL">4<e_numex>-<b_numex type="CARDINAL">4<e_numex> on
that first West Coast swing, while <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Baltimore<e_enamex> _ which always opens
at Camden Yards _ jumped ahead in the standing. Every trip to the
West Coast in recent years has challenged the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Yankees<e_enamex>, who are
<b_numex type="CARDINAL">64<e_numex>-<b_numex type="CARDINAL">83<e_numex> on this side of the country in the <b_timex type="DATE">1990s<e_timex>.
	   Rain, West Coast, whatever, the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Yankees<e_enamex> are <b_numex type="CARDINAL">0<e_numex>-<b_numex type="CARDINAL">2<e_numex>. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Ramiro Mendoza<e_enamex>,
their least effective pitcher in <b_timex type="DATE">spring<e_timex> training, started <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex>
night against the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Athletics<e_enamex>.
	   In <b_timex type="DATE">Thursday<e_timex>'s defeat, there were no errors charged to the
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Yankees<e_enamex>. But they played miserably, making more mistakes in <b_numex type="CARDINAL">one<e_numex>
game than in the final <b_timex type="DURATION">two weeks<e_timex> of <b_timex type="DATE">spring<e_timex> training.
	   In the first inning, the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Yankees<e_enamex> threatened. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Jeter<e_enamex> singled and
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Paul O'Neill<e_enamex> walked with <b_numex type="CARDINAL">one<e_numex> out. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Bernie Williams<e_enamex> smashed a line
drive to center field, where <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Anaheim<e_enamex>'s <b_enamex type="PERSON">Jim Edmonds<e_enamex> stepped forward
and caught the ball neck-high. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Jeter<e_enamex>, running on contact, was
almost at third and was easily doubled off second base to end the
inning.
	   Dismissing the unthinkable _ that <b_enamex type="PERSON">Jeter<e_enamex> forgot the number of
outs _ <b_enamex type="PERSON">Torre<e_enamex> said he thought <b_enamex type="PERSON">Williams<e_enamex>' liner was going to land for
a hit. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Jeter<e_enamex> said he did, too.
	   ``I was thinking `score,' even though it was hit hard, and I was
trying to get a good jump,'' <b_enamex type="PERSON">Jeter<e_enamex> said. ``<b_enamex type="PERSON">Edmonds<e_enamex> caught it like
he was camped under a fly ball.''
	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Anaheim<e_enamex> scored <b_numex type="CARDINAL">three<e_numex> runs in the fourth inning against <b_enamex type="PERSON">David
Wells<e_enamex>, but if the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Yankee<e_enamex> infielders had made the plays, the damage
could have been limited to <b_numex type="CARDINAL">one<e_numex> run. <b_numex type="CARDINAL">One<e_numex> out into the inning, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Dave
Hollins<e_enamex> hammered a solo homer. Then <b_enamex type="PERSON">Tim Salmon<e_enamex> chopped a ball into
the shortstop hole, where <b_enamex type="PERSON">Jeter<e_enamex> fielded it and fired toward first.
The throw skipped in front of first baseman <b_enamex type="PERSON">Tino Martinez<e_enamex>, who was
unable to scoop the ball cleanly. Base hit.
	   After <b_enamex type="PERSON">Wells<e_enamex> walked <b_enamex type="PERSON">Cecil Fielder<e_enamex>, the swift <b_enamex type="PERSON">Garret Anderson<e_enamex>
slapped a <b_numex type="MEASURE">half-speed<e_numex> grounder up the middle. The chances of an
inning-ending double play were marginal, but any shot was lost when
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Jeter<e_enamex> fumbled the bouncer and settled for the out at first. Instead
of being out of the inning, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Wells<e_enamex> had to pitch to <b_enamex type="PERSON">Phil Nevin<e_enamex> with
<b_numex type="CARDINAL">two<e_numex> runners on and <b_numex type="CARDINAL">two<e_numex> out, and he gave up a <b_numex type="MEASURE">two-run<e_numex> double.
	   ``That was tough,'' <b_enamex type="PERSON">Jeter<e_enamex> said of <b_enamex type="PERSON">Anderson<e_enamex>'s ball. ``He hit it
slow.''
	   But <b_enamex type="PERSON">Wells<e_enamex> accepted his share of the blame for the <b_numex type="CARDINAL">three<e_numex> runs; he
threw a fastball with no balls and <b_numex type="CARDINAL">two<e_numex> strikes to <b_enamex type="PERSON">Hollins<e_enamex> for the
home run and a hanging curveball for <b_enamex type="PERSON">Nevin<e_enamex>'s double.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Darryl Strawberry<e_enamex> and <b_enamex type="PERSON">Williams<e_enamex> played alongside each other in
<b_timex type="DATE">spring<e_timex> training without having <b_numex type="CARDINAL">one<e_numex> ball hit equidistant between
them. This occurred twice <b_timex type="DATE">Thursday<e_timex>, with <b_enamex type="PERSON">Strawberry<e_enamex> catching the
first ball and dropping the second, as he avoided collisions with
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Williams<e_enamex>. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Strawberry<e_enamex>'s second play was ruled a triple by <b_enamex type="PERSON">Gary
DiSarcina<e_enamex>, setting up a <b_numex type="MEASURE">two-run<e_numex> seventh.
	   In the eighth, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Scott Brosius<e_enamex>, the third baseman, fielded a
grounder with runners at first and third and the infield in.
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Brosius<e_enamex> glanced at <b_enamex type="PERSON">Carlos Garcia<e_enamex>, the runner at third, before
looking to second; <b_enamex type="PERSON">Brosius<e_enamex> had forgotten that second baseman <b_enamex type="PERSON">Chuck
Knoblauch<e_enamex> would not be covering the base with the infield in. So
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Brosius<e_enamex> quickly threw to first. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Garcia<e_enamex> noted <b_enamex type="PERSON">Brosius<e_enamex>' indecision
and scored.
	   As the infielders reset for the next hitter, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Brosius<e_enamex> tapped his
chest, acknowledging his mistake.
	   Later, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Strawberry<e_enamex> overthrew a cutoff man.
	   ``Hopefully, we got all the garbage out of the way,'' said
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Torre<e_enamex>, for <b_numex type="CARDINAL">one<e_numex> night the manager of the bad news <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Yankees<e_enamex>.
	   INSIDE PITCH
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Chili Davis<e_enamex>, the designated hitter, left <b_timex type="DATE">Thursday<e_timex> night's game
after his third at-bat with what <b_enamex type="PERSON">Joe Torre<e_enamex> described as pain in his
right foot. ``His foot was a little numb,'' <b_enamex type="PERSON">Torre<e_enamex> said. ``He had
his shoe tied a little too tight.'' ... The <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Yankees<e_enamex> went <b_numex type="CARDINAL">1<e_numex> for <b_numex type="CARDINAL">16<e_numex>
with runners in scoring position in the first <b_numex type="CARDINAL">two<e_numex> games ... <b_enamex type="PERSON">Chuck
Knoblauch<e_enamex> has reached base in <b_numex type="CARDINAL">six<e_numex> of his <b_numex type="CARDINAL">nine<e_numex> plate appearances ...
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Orlando Hernandez<e_enamex>, the right-hander who defected from <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Cuba<e_enamex>, pitched
<b_numex type="CARDINAL">two<e_numex> solid innings in a simulated game against Class A players in
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Tampa<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Fla.<e_enamex>, allowing <b_numex type="CARDINAL">two<e_numex> infield hits.
