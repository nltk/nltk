Police have killer of <b_numex type="MEASURE">11-year<e_numex>-old girl
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">BUDAPEST<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Hungary<e_enamex> (<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">AP<e_enamex>) _ Police said <b_timex type="DATE">Wednesday<e_timex> that a
<b_numex type="MEASURE">19-year<e_numex>-old man had confessed to killing an <b_numex type="MEASURE">11-year<e_numex>-old girl, whose
brutal stabbing at her home earlier this month caught nationwide
attention.
	   The state news agency <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">MTI<e_enamex> reported the arrest of a man other
media identified as <b_enamex type="PERSON">Gabor Tanczos<e_enamex>, who reportedly followed the girl
home <b_timex type="DATE">April 3<e_timex>. She did not close the door properly, as she was about
to leave for a music class, when her killer walked in, hit her and
then stabbed her to death, according to media accounts.
	   Her mother and brother were abroad and her father, who was to
pick her up at school, was delayed when his car broke down.
	   The murder shocked the small town of <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Koermend<e_enamex>, <b_numex type="MEASURE">200 kilometers<e_numex>
(<b_numex type="MEASURE">125 miles<e_numex>) southwest of <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Budapest<e_enamex>, and the nation. Extra police
were sent to the town to patrol.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Tanczos<e_enamex> was questioned by police. Contradictions in his account
led investigators to take a closer look, when they found his
fingerprints in the girl's home, <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">MTI<e_enamex> said.
	   The young man then confessed, it reported, adding that police
still do not know the motive.
	   The girl, who has not been identified in media reports, was not
molested sexually and nothing was removed from the premises.
