BOOK
______

The following rendering/organizational features would be helpful:
- allow consecutive numbering of examples within a chapter
- develop a 'house-style' for call-outs (e.g., Note, Tip, etc)
   - which ones are allowed?
   - when do we use which?
   - how should they be rendered?
- agree a method for cross-references between chapters
- collect all references into a final bibliography
- once PDF versions are available, add rule to Makefile which compiles a single PDF for all chapters

More substantive:
- what is the final inventory of chapters for the first edition?
    - can we just make do with what's there plus a chapter on feature-based syntax and semantics?
- proposed draft cycle for book
    - produce and internally review a complete draft of all chapters at the end of each month, Sept - Dec
