"""
Zen Chatbot talks in gems of Zen wisdom.

This is a sample conversation with Zen Chatbot:
ZC:    Welcome, my child.
me:    Good afternoon.
ZC:    Ask the question you have come to ask.
me:    How can I achieve enlightenment?
ZC:    How do you suppose?
me:    Through meditation.
ZC:    Form is emptiness, and emptiness form.
me:    How can I empty my mind of worldly troubles?
ZC:    Will an answer to that really help in your search for enlightenment?
me:    Yes.
ZC:    It is better to be right than to be certain.
me:    I seek truth and wisdom.
ZC:    The search for truth is a long journey.
me:    Are you sure?
ZC:    Maybe sure, maybe not sure.


The chatbot structure is based on that of chat.eliza. Thus, it uses
a translation table to convert from question to response
i.e. "I am" --> "you are"

Of course, since Zen Chatbot does not understand the meaning of any words,
responses are very limited. Zen Chatbot will usually answer very vaguely, or
respond to a question by asking a different question, in much the same way
as Eliza.
