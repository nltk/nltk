Porter Stemmer

This is the Porter stemming algorithm. It follows the algorithm
presented in

Porter, M. "An algorithm for suffix stripping." Program 14.3 (1980): 130-137.

with some optional deviations that can be turned on or off with the
`mode` argument to the constructor.

Martin Porter, the algorithm's inventor, maintains a web page about the
algorithm at

    https://www.tartarus.org/~martin/PorterStemmer/

which includes another Python implementation and other implementations
in many languages.

    A word stemmer based on the Porter stemming algorithm.

        Porter, M. "An algorithm for suffix stripping."
        Program 14.3 (1980): 130-137.

    See https://www.tartarus.org/~martin/PorterStemmer/ for the homepage
    of the algorithm.

    Martin Porter has endorsed several modifications to the Porter
    algorithm since writing his original paper, and those extensions are
    included in the implementations on his website. Additionally, others
    have proposed further improvements to the algorithm, including NLTK
    contributors. There are thus three modes that can be selected by
    passing the appropriate constant to the class constructor's `mode`
    attribute:

    - PorterStemmer.ORIGINAL_ALGORITHM

        An implementation that is faithful to the original paper.

        Note that Martin Porter has deprecated this version of the
        algorithm. Martin distributes implementations of the Porter
        Stemmer in many languages, hosted at:

        https://www.tartarus.org/~martin/PorterStemmer/

        and all of these implementations include his extensions. He
        strongly recommends against using the original, published
        version of the algorithm; only use this mode if you clearly
        understand why you are choosing to do so.

    - PorterStemmer.MARTIN_EXTENSIONS

        An implementation that only uses the modifications to the
        algorithm that are included in the implementations on Martin
        Porter's website. He has declared Porter frozen, so the
        behaviour of those implementations should never change.

    - PorterStemmer.NLTK_EXTENSIONS (default)

        An implementation that includes further improvements devised by
        NLTK contributors or taken from other modified implementations
        found on the web.

    For the best stemming, you should use the default NLTK_EXTENSIONS
    version. However, if you need to get the same results as either the
    original algorithm or one of Martin Porter's hosted versions for
    compatibility with an existing implementation or dataset, you can use
    one of the other modes instead.
