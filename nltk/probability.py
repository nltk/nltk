"""
Classes for representing and processing probabilistic information.

The L{FreqDist} class is used to encode X{frequency distributions},
which count the number of times that each outcome of an experiment
occurs.

The L{ProbDistI} class defines a standard interface for X{probability
distributions}, which encode the probability of each outcome for an
experiment.  There are two types of probability distribution:

  - X{derived probability distributions} are created from frequency
    distributions.  They attempt to model the probability distribution
    that generated the frequency distribution.
  - X{analytic probability distributions} are created directly from
    parameters (such as variance).

The L{ConditionalFreqDist} class and L{ConditionalProbDistI} interface
are used to encode conditional distributions.  Conditional probability
distributions can be derived or analytic; but currently the only
implementation of the C{ConditionalProbDistI} interface is
L{ConditionalProbDist}, a derived distribution.

class FreqDist(dict):
    """
    A frequency distribution for the outcomes of an experiment.  A
    frequency distribution records the number of times each outcome of
    an experiment has occurred.  For example, a frequency distribution
    could be used to record the frequency of each word type in a
    document.  Formally, a frequency distribution can be defined as a
    function mapping from each sample to the number of times that
    sample occurred as an outcome.

    Frequency distributions are generally constructed by running a
    number of experiments, and incrementing the count for a sample
    every time it is an outcome of an experiment.  For example, the
    following code will produce a frequency distribution that encodes
    how often each word occurs in a text:
    
        >>> fdist = FreqDist()
        >>> for word in tokenize.whitespace(sent):
        ...    fdist.inc(word.lower())

class ConditionalFreqDist(object):
    """
    A collection of frequency distributions for a single experiment
    run under different conditions.  Conditional frequency
    distributions are used to record the number of times each sample
    occurred, given the condition under which the experiment was run.
    For example, a conditional frequency distribution could be used to
    record the frequency of each word (type) in a document, given its
    length.  Formally, a conditional frequency distribution can be
    defined as a function that maps from each condition to the
    C{FreqDist} for the experiment under that condition.

    The frequency distribution for each condition is accessed using
    the indexing operator:

        >>> cfdist[3]
        <FreqDist with 73 outcomes>
        >>> cfdist[3].freq('the')
        0.4

    When the indexing operator is used to access the frequency
    distribution for a condition that has not been accessed before,
    C{ConditionalFreqDist} creates a new empty C{FreqDist} for that
    condition.

    Conditional frequency distributions are typically constructed by
    repeatedly running an experiment under a variety of conditions,
    and incrementing the sample outcome counts for the appropriate
    conditions.  For example, the following code will produce a
    conditional frequency distribution that encodes how often each
    word type occurs, given the length of that word type:

        >>> cfdist = ConditionalFreqDist()
        >>> for word in tokenize.whitespace(sent):
        ...     condition = len(word)
        ...     cfdist[condition].inc(word)
