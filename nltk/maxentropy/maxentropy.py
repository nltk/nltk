This module is an adaptation of "ftwmaxent" by Ed Schofield, first posted
on SourceForge as part of the "textmodeller" project in 2002.  The
official repository is now SciPy (since Nov 2005); the SourceForge
ftwmaxent code will not be developed further.

------------

Change log:

Since 2.0:
* Code simplification.  Removed dualapprox(), gradapprox() and other
  alias methods for bigmodel objects.  Use dual(), grad() etc. instead.
* Added support for testing on an external sample during optimization.
* Removed incomplete support for the (slow) GIS algorithm

Since 2.0-alpha4:
* Name change maxent -> maxentropy
* Removed online (sequential) estimation of feature expectations and
  variances.

Since v2.0-alpha3:
(1) Name change ftwmaxent -> scipy/maxent
(2) Modification for inclusion in scipy tree.  Broke one big class into
    two smaller classes, one for small models, the other for large models.
    Here a 'small' model is one defined on a sample space small enough to sum
    over in practice, whereas a 'large' model is on a sample space that is
    high-dimensional and continuous or discrete but too large to sum over,
    and requires Monte Carlo simulation.
(3) Refactoring:
    self.Eapprox -> self.mu
    p_0 -> aux_dist
    p0 -> aux_dist
    p_dot -> aux_dist_dot
    qdot -> p_dot
    q_dot -> p_dot
    q_theta -> p_theta
    E_p -> E_p_tilde
    E_q -> E_p

Since v2.0-alpha2:
Using multiple static feature matrices is now supported.  The generator
function supplied to generate feature matrices is called matrixtrials'
times each iteration.  This is useful for variance estimation of the E
and log Z estimators across the trials, without drawing another sample
each iteration (when staticsample = True).

Since v2.0-alpha1:
Sample feature matrices, if used, are sampled on the fly with a supplied
generator function, optionally multiple times to estimate the sample
variance of the feature expectation estimates.  An alternative is the
online estimation alg.

Since v0.8.5:
Added code for online (sequential) estimation of feature expectations and
variances.

        """Fit the maxent model p whose feature expectations are given
        by the vector K.

        Model expectations are computed either exactly or using Monte
        Carlo simulation, depending on the 'func' and 'grad' parameters
        passed to this function.

        For 'model' instances, expectations are computed exactly, by summing
        over the given sample space.  If the sample space is continuous or too
        large to iterate over, use the 'bigmodel' class instead.

        For 'bigmodel' instances, the model expectations are not computed
        exactly (by summing or integrating over a sample space) but
        approximately (by Monte Carlo simulation).  Simulation is necessary
        when the sample space is too large to sum or integrate over in
        practice, like a continuous sample space in more than about 4
        dimensions or a large discrete space like all possible sentences in a
        natural language.

        Approximating the expectations by sampling requires an instrumental
        distribution that should be close to the model for fast convergence.
        The tails should be fatter than the model.  This instrumental
        distribution is specified by calling setsampleFgen() with a
        user-supplied generator function that yields a matrix of features of a
        random sample and its log pdf values.

        The algorithm can be 'CG', 'BFGS', 'LBFGSB', 'Powell', or
        'Nelder-Mead'.

        The CG (conjugate gradients) method is the default; it is quite fast
        and requires only linear space in the number of parameters, (not
        quadratic, like Newton-based methods).

        The BFGS (Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno) algorithm is a
        variable metric Newton method.  It is perhaps faster than the CG
        method but requires O(N^2) instead of O(N) memory, so it is
        infeasible for more than about 10^3 parameters.

        The Powell algorithm doesn't require gradients.  For small models
        it is slow but robust.  For big models (where func and grad are
        simulated) with large variance in the function estimates, this
        may be less robust than the gradient-based algorithms.

        This function is computed as:

        For 'bigmodel' objects, it estimates the entropy dual without

        the norm constant Z using importance sampling as in
        [Rosenfeld01whole].  This estimator is deterministic for any

        the entropy dual [see my thesis], justifying the use of this
        estimator in conjunction with grad() in optimization methods that
        use both the function and gradient. Note, however, that
        convergence guarantees break down for most optimization
        algorithms in the presence of stochastic error.

        Note that, for 'bigmodel' objects, the dual estimate is
        deterministic for any given sample.  It is given as:

    A conditional maximum-entropy (exponential-form) model p(x|w) on a

    This is useful for classification problems:
    given the context w, what is the probability of each class x?

    The form of such a model is::

        p(x | w) = exp(theta . f(w, x)) / Z(w; theta)

    where Z(w; theta) is a normalization term equal to::

        Z(w; theta) = sum_x exp(theta . f(w, x)).

    The sum is over all classes x in the set Y, which must be supplied to
    the constructor as the parameter 'samplespace'.

    Such a model form arises from maximizing the entropy of a conditional
    model p(x | w) subject to the constraints::

        K_i = E f_i(W, X)

    where the expectation is with respect to the distribution::

        q(w) p(x | w)

    observations of the context w in a training set.  Normally the vector
    K = {K_i} of expectations is set equal to the expectation of f_i(w,
    x) with respect to the empirical distribution.

    This method minimizes the Lagrangian dual L of the entropy, which is

    Note that both sums are only over the training set {w,x}, not the

    set.

    The partial derivatives of L are::

        alternative to defining a sampler in terms of a (fixed size)
        feature matrix sampleF and accompanying vector samplelogprobs of
        log probabilities.

        Calling sampler.next() should generate tuples (F, lp), where F is
        an (m x n) matrix of features of the n sample points x_1,...,x_n,
        and lp is an array of length n containing the (natural) log
        probability density (pdf or pmf) of each point under the
        auxiliary sampling distribution.

        The output of sampler.next() can optionally be a 3-tuple (F, lp,
        sample) instead of a 2-tuple (F, lp).  In this case the value
        'sample' is then stored as a class variable self.sample.  This is
        useful for inspecting the output and understanding the model
        characteristics.

        If matrixtrials > 1 and staticsample = True, (which is useful for
        estimating variance between the different feature estimates),
        sampler.next() will be called once for each trial
        (0,...,matrixtrials) for each iteration.  This allows using a set
        of feature matrices, each of which stays constant over all
        iterations.

        We now insist that sampleFgen.next() return the entire sample
        feature matrix to be used each iteration to avoid overhead in
        extra function calls and memory copying (and extra code).

        An alternative was to supply a list of samplers,
        sampler=[sampler0, sampler1, ..., sampler_{m-1}, samplerZ], one
        for each feature and one for estimating the normalization
        constant Z. But this code was unmaintained, and has now been
        removed (but it's in Ed's CVS repository :).
