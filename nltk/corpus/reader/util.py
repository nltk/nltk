#{ Corpus View
######################################################################

class StreamBackedCorpusView(AbstractLazySequence):
    """
    A 'view' of a corpus file, which acts like a sequence of tokens:
    it can be accessed by index, iterated over, etc.  However, the
    tokens are only constructed as-needed -- the entire corpus is
    never stored in memory at once.

    The constructor to C{StreamBackedCorpusView} takes two arguments:
    a corpus fileid (specified as a string or as a L{PathPointer});
    and a block reader.  A X{block reader} is a function that reads
    zero or more tokens from a stream, and returns them as a list.  A
    very simple example of a block reader is:

        >>> def simple_block_reader(stream):
        ...     return stream.readline().split()

    This simple block reader reads a single line at a time, and
    returns a single token (consisting of a string) for each
    whitespace-separated substring on the line.

    When deciding how to define the block reader for a given
    corpus, careful consideration should be given to the size of
    blocks handled by the block reader.  Smaller block sizes will
    increase the memory requirements of the corpus view's internal
    data structures (by 2 integers per block).  On the other hand,
    larger block sizes may decrease performance for random access to
    the corpus.  (But note that larger block sizes will I{not}
    decrease performance for iteration.)
    
    Internally, C{CorpusView} maintains a partial mapping from token
    index to file position, with one entry per block.  When a token
    with a given index M{i} is requested, the C{CorpusView} constructs
    it as follows:

      1. First, it searches the toknum/filepos mapping for the token
         index closest to (but less than or equal to) M{i}.
         
      2. Then, starting at the file position corresponding to that
         index, it reads one block at a time using the block reader
         until it reaches the requested token.

    The toknum/filepos mapping is created lazily: it is initially
    empty, but every time a new block is read, the block's
    initial token is added to the mapping.  (Thus, the toknum/filepos
    map has one entry per block.)

    In order to increase efficiency for random access patterns that
    have high degrees of locality, the corpus view may cache one or
    more blocks.

    @note: Each C{CorpusView} object internally maintains an open file
        object for its underlying corpus file.  This file should be
        automatically closed when the C{CorpusView} is garbage collected,
        but if you wish to close it manually, use the L{close()}
        method.  If you access a C{CorpusView}'s items after it has been
        closed, the file object will be automatically re-opened.
        
    @warning: If the contents of the file are modified during the
        lifetime of the C{CorpusView}, then the C{CorpusView}'s behavior
        is undefined.

    @warning: If a unicode encoding is specified when constructing a
        C{CorpusView}, then the block reader may only call
        C{stream.seek()} with offsets that have been returned by
        C{stream.tell()}; in particular, calling C{stream.seek()} with
        relative offsets, or with offsets based on string lengths, may
        lead to incorrect behavior.

    @ivar _block_reader: The function used to read 
        a single block from the underlying file stream.
    @ivar _toknum: A list containing the token index of each block
        that has been processed.  In particular, C{_toknum[i]} is the
        token index of the first token in block C{i}.  Together
        with L{_filepos}, this forms a partial mapping between token
        indices and file positions.
    @ivar _filepos: A list containing the file position of each block
        that has been processed.  In particular, C{_toknum[i]} is the
        file position of the first character in block C{i}.  Together
        with L{_toknum}, this forms a partial mapping between token
        indices and file positions.
    @ivar _stream: The stream used to access the underlying corpus file.
    @ivar _len: The total number of tokens in the corpus, if known;
        or C{None}, if the number of tokens is not yet known.
    @ivar _eofpos: The character position of the last character in the
        file.  This is calculated when the corpus view is initialized,
        and is used to decide when the end of file has been reached.
    @ivar _cache: A cache of the most recently read block.  It
       is encoded as a tuple (start_toknum, end_toknum, tokens), where
       start_toknum is the token index of the first token in the block;
       end_toknum is the token index of the first token not in the
       block; and tokens is a list of the tokens in the block.
