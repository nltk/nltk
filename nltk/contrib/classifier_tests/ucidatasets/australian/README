4.  Relevant Information:

    This file concerns credit card applications.  All attribute names
    and values have been changed to meaningless symbols to protect
    confidentiality of the data.
  
    This dataset is interesting because there is a good mix of
    attributes -- continuous, nominal with small numbers of
    values, and nominal with larger numbers of values.  There
    are also a few missing values.
  
5.  Number of Instances: 690

6.  Number of Attributes: 14 + class attribute

7.  Attribute Information:   THERE ARE 6 NUMERICAL AND 8 CATEGORICAL ATTRIBUTES.
 
                             THE LABELS HAVE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE CONVENIENCE
                             OF THE STATISTICAL ALGORITHMS.   FOR EXAMPLE,
                             ATTRIBUTE 4 ORIGINALLY HAD 3 LABELS p,g,gg AND
                             THESE HAVE BEEN CHANGED TO LABELS 1,2,3.

    A4:	1,2,3         CATEGORICAL

8.  Missing Attribute Values:
    37 cases (5%) HAD one or more missing values.  The missing
    values from particular attributes WERE:

    A1:  12
    A2:  12
    A4:   6
    A5:   6
    A6:   9
    A7:   9
    A14: 13
    
    THESE WERE REPLACED BY THE MODE OF THE ATTRIBUTE (CATEGORICAL)
                               MEAN OF THE ATTRIBUTE (CONTINUOUS)
                           
9.  Class Distribution
  
    +: 307 (44.5%)    CLASS 2
    -: 383 (55.5%)    CLASS 1
