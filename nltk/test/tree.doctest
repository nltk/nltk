 Unit tests for nltk.tree.Tree
===============================

    >>> from nltk.tree import *

Some trees to run tests on:

    >>> dp1 = Tree('dp', [Tree('d', ['the']), Tree('np', ['dog'])])
    >>> dp2 = Tree('dp', [Tree('d', ['the']), Tree('np', ['cat'])])
    >>> vp = Tree('vp', [Tree('v', ['chased']), dp2])
    >>> tree = Tree('s', [dp1, vp])
    >>> print tree
    (s (dp (d the) (np dog)) (vp (v chased) (dp (d the) (np cat))))

The node value is stored using the `node` attribute:

    >>> dp1.node, dp2.node, vp.node, tree.node
    ('dp', 'dp', 'vp', 's')

    >>> print tree[1,1,1,0]
    cat

The `treepositions` method returns a list of the tree positions of
subtrees and leaves in a tree.  By default, it gives the position of
every tree, subtree, and leaf, in prefix order:

    >>> print tree.treepositions()
    [(), (0,), (0, 0), (0, 0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 1, 0), (1,), (1, 0), (1, 0, 0), (1, 1), (1, 1, 0), (1, 1, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1, 0)]

In addition to `str` and `repr`, several methods exist to convert a
tree object to one of several standard tree encodings:

    >>> print tree.pprint_latex_qtree()
    \Tree [.s
            [.dp [.d the ] [.np dog ] ]
            [.vp [.v chased ] [.dp [.d the ] [.np cat ] ] ] ]

Trees can be parsed from treebank strings with the static
`Tree.parse()` method:

    >>> tree2 = Tree.parse('(S (NP I) (VP (V enjoyed) (NP my cookie)))')
    >>> print tree2
    (S (NP I) (VP (V enjoyed) (NP my cookie)))

If the `Tree` constructor is called with a single string argument,
then it simply delegates to `Tree.parse()`.

    >>> print Tree('(S (NP I) (VP (V enjoyed) (NP my cookie)))')
    (S (NP I) (VP (V enjoyed) (NP my cookie)))

Trees can be compared for equality:

    >>> tree == Tree.parse(str(tree))
    True
    >>> tree2 == Tree.parse(str(tree2))
    True
    >>> tree == tree2
    False
    >>> tree == Tree.parse(str(tree2))
    False
    >>> tree2 == Tree.parse(str(tree))
    False

    >>> tree != Tree.parse(str(tree))
    False
    >>> tree2 != Tree.parse(str(tree2))
    False
    >>> tree != tree2
    True
    >>> tree != Tree.parse(str(tree2))
    True
    >>> tree2 != Tree.parse(str(tree))
    True

    >>> tree < tree2 or tree > tree2
    True

Tree Parsing
============

The class method `Tree.parse()` can be used to parse trees:

    >>> tree = Tree.parse('(S (NP I) (VP (V enjoyed) (NP my cookie)))')
    >>> print tree
    (S (NP I) (VP (V enjoyed) (NP my cookie)))

When called on a subclass of `Tree`, it will create trees of that
type:

    >>> tree = ImmutableTree.parse('(VP (V enjoyed) (NP my cookie))')
    >>> print tree
    (VP (V enjoyed) (NP my cookie))
    >>> print type(tree)
    <class 'nltk.tree.ImmutableTree'>
    >>> tree[1] = 'x'
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      . . .
    ValueError: ImmutableTree may not be modified
    >>> del tree[0]
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      . . .
    ValueError: ImmutableTree may not be modified

The ``brackets`` parameter can be used to specify two characters that
should be used as brackets:

    >>> print Tree.parse('[S [NP I] [VP [V enjoyed] [NP my cookie]]]',
    ...                  brackets='[]')
    (S (NP I) (VP (V enjoyed) (NP my cookie)))
    >>> print Tree.parse('<S <NP I> <VP <V enjoyed> <NP my cookie>>>',
    ...                  brackets='<>')
    (S (NP I) (VP (V enjoyed) (NP my cookie)))

If ``brackets`` is not a string, or is not exactly two characters,
then `Tree.parse` raises an exception:

    >>> Tree.parse('<VP <V enjoyed> <NP my cookie>>', brackets='')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      . . .
    TypeError: brackets must be a length-2 string
    >>> Tree.parse('<VP <V enjoyed> <NP my cookie>>', brackets='<<>>')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      . . .
    TypeError: brackets must be a length-2 string
    >>> Tree.parse('<VP <V enjoyed> <NP my cookie>>', brackets=12)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      . . .
    TypeError: brackets must be a length-2 string
    >>> Tree.parse('<<NP my cookie>>', brackets=('<<','>>'))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      . . .
    TypeError: brackets must be a length-2 string

(We may add support for multi-character brackets in the future, in
which case the ``brackets=('<<','>>')`` example would start working.)

Whitespace brackets are not permitted:

    >>> Tree.parse('(NP my cookie\n', brackets='(\n')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      . . .
    TypeError: whitespace brackets not allowed

If an invalid tree is given to Tree.parse, then it raises a
ValueError, with a description of the problem:

    >>> Tree.parse('(NP my cookie) (NP my milk)')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      . . .
    ValueError: Tree.parse(): expected 'end-of-string' but got '(NP'
                at index 15.
                    "...y cookie) (NP my mil..."
                                  ^
    >>> Tree.parse(')NP my cookie(')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      . . .
    ValueError: Tree.parse(): expected '(' but got ')'
                at index 0.
                    ")NP my coo..."
                     ^
    >>> Tree.parse('(NP my cookie))')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      . . .
    ValueError: Tree.parse(): expected 'end-of-string' but got ')'
                at index 14.
                    "...my cookie))"
                                  ^
    >>> Tree.parse('my cookie)')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      . . .
    ValueError: Tree.parse(): expected '(' but got 'my'
                at index 0.
                    "my cookie)"
                     ^
    >>> Tree.parse('(NP my cookie')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      . . .
    ValueError: Tree.parse(): expected ')' but got 'end-of-string'
                at index 13.
                    "... my cookie"
                                  ^
    >>> Tree.parse('')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      . . .
    ValueError: Tree.parse(): expected '(' but got 'end-of-string'
                at index 0.
                    ""
                     ^

Trees with no children are supported:

    >>> print Tree.parse('(S)')
    (S )
    >>> print Tree.parse('(X (Y) (Z))')
    (X (Y ) (Z ))

Trees with an empty node and no children are supported:

    >>> print Tree.parse('()')
    ( )
    >>> print Tree.parse('(X () ())')
    (X ( ) ( ))

Trees with an empty node and children are supported, but only if the
first child is not a leaf (otherwise, it will be treated as the node
value).

    >>> print Tree.parse('((A) (B) (C))')
    ( (A ) (B ) (C ))
    >>> print Tree.parse('((A) leaf)')
    ( (A ) leaf)
    >>> print Tree.parse('(((())))')
    ( ( ( ( ))))

The optional arguments `parse_node` and `parse_leaf` may be used to
transform the string values of nodes or leaves.

    >>> print Tree.parse('(A b (C d e) (F (G h i)))',
    ...                  parse_node=lambda s: '<%s>' % s,
    ...                  parse_leaf=lambda s: '"%s"' % s)
    (<A> "b" (<C> "d" "e") (<F> (<G> "h" "i")))

These transformation functions are typically used when the node or
leaf values should be parsed to a non-string value (such as a feature
structure).  If node values and leaf values need to be able to include
whitespace, then you must also use the optional `node_pattern` and
`leaf_pattern` arguments.

    >>> from nltk.featstruct import FeatStruct
    >>> tree = Tree.parse('([cat=NP] [lex=the] [lex=dog])',
    ...                   parse_node=FeatStruct, parse_leaf=FeatStruct)
    >>> tree.node = tree.node.unify(FeatStruct('[num=singular]'))
    >>> print tree
    ([cat='NP', num='singular'] [lex='the'] [lex='dog'])

The optional argument ``remove_empty_top_bracketing`` can be used to
remove any top-level empty bracketing that occurs.

    >>> print Tree.parse('((S (NP I) (VP (V enjoyed) (NP my cookie))))',
    ...                  remove_empty_top_bracketing=True)
    (S (NP I) (VP (V enjoyed) (NP my cookie)))

It will not remove a top-level empty bracketing with multiple children:

    >>> print Tree.parse('((A a) (B b))')
    ( (A a) (B b))

Parented Trees
==============
`ParentedTree` is a subclass of `Tree` that automatically maintains
parent pointers for single-parented trees.  Parented trees can be
created directly from a node value and a list of children:

    >>> ptree = (
    ...     ParentedTree('VP', [
    ...         ParentedTree('VERB', ['saw']),
    ...         ParentedTree('NP', [
    ...             ParentedTree('DET', ['the']),
    ...             ParentedTree('NOUN', ['dog'])])]))
    >>> print ptree
    (VP (VERB saw) (NP (DET the) (NOUN dog)))

Parented trees can be created from strings using the classmethod
`ParentedTree.parse`:

    >>> ptree = ParentedTree.parse('(VP (VERB saw) (NP (DET the) (NOUN dog)))')
    >>> print ptree
    (VP (VERB saw) (NP (DET the) (NOUN dog)))
    >>> print type(ptree)
    <class 'nltk.tree.ParentedTree'>

Parented trees can also be created by using the classmethod
`ParentedTree.convert` to convert another type of tree to a parented
tree:

    >>> tree = Tree.parse('(VP (VERB saw) (NP (DET the) (NOUN dog)))')
    >>> ptree = ParentedTree.convert(tree)
    >>> print ptree
    (VP (VERB saw) (NP (DET the) (NOUN dog)))
    >>> print type(ptree)
    <class 'nltk.tree.ParentedTree'>

.. clean-up:

    >>> del tree

`ParentedTree`\ s should never be used in the same tree as `Tree`\ s
or `MultiParentedTree`\ s.  Mixing tree implementations may result in
incorrect parent pointers and in `TypeError` exceptions:

    >>> # Inserting a Tree in a ParentedTree gives an exception:
    >>> ParentedTree('NP', [
    ...     Tree('DET', ['the']), Tree('NOUN', ['dog'])])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      . . .
    TypeError: Can not insert a non-ParentedTree into a ParentedTree

    >>> # inserting a ParentedTree in a Tree gives incorrect parent pointers:
    >>> broken_tree = Tree('NP', [
    ...     ParentedTree('DET', ['the']), ParentedTree('NOUN', ['dog'])])
    >>> print broken_tree[0].parent()
    None

Parented Tree Methods
------------------------
In addition to all the methods defined by the `Tree` class, the
`ParentedTree` class adds six new methods whose values are
automatically updated whenver a parented tree is modified: `parent()`,
`parent_index()`, `left_sibling()`, `right_sibling()`, `root()`, and
`treeposition()`.

The `parent()` method contains a `ParentedTree`\ 's parent, if it has
one; and ``None`` otherwise.  `ParentedTree`\ s that do not have
parents are known as "root trees."

    >>> for subtree in ptree.subtrees():
    ...     print subtree
    ...     print '  Parent = %s' % subtree.parent()
    (VP (VERB saw) (NP (DET the) (NOUN dog)))
      Parent = None
    (VERB saw)
      Parent = (VP (VERB saw) (NP (DET the) (NOUN dog)))
    (NP (DET the) (NOUN dog))
      Parent = (VP (VERB saw) (NP (DET the) (NOUN dog)))
    (DET the)
      Parent = (NP (DET the) (NOUN dog))
    (NOUN dog)
      Parent = (NP (DET the) (NOUN dog))

The `parent_index()` method stores the index of a tree in its parent's
child list.  If a tree does not have a parent, then its `parent_index`
is ``None``.

    >>> for subtree in ptree.subtrees():
    ...     print subtree
    ...     print '  Parent Index = %s' % subtree.parent_index()
    ...     assert (subtree.parent() is None or
    ...             subtree.parent()[subtree.parent_index()] is subtree)
    (VP (VERB saw) (NP (DET the) (NOUN dog)))
      Parent Index = None
    (VERB saw)
      Parent Index = 0
    (NP (DET the) (NOUN dog))
      Parent Index = 1
    (DET the)
      Parent Index = 0
    (NOUN dog)
      Parent Index = 1

Note that ``ptree.parent().index(ptree)`` is *not* equivalent to
``ptree.parent_index()``.  In particular, ``ptree.parent().index(ptree)``
will return the index of the first child of ``ptree.parent()`` that is
equal to ``ptree`` (using ``==``); and that child may not be
``ptree``:

    >>> on_and_on = ParentedTree('CONJP', [
    ...     ParentedTree('PREP', ['on']),
    ...     ParentedTree('COJN', ['and']),
    ...     ParentedTree('PREP', ['on'])])
    >>> second_on = on_and_on[2]
    >>> print second_on.parent_index()
    2
    >>> print second_on.parent().index(second_on)
    0

The methods `left_sibling()` and `right_sibling()` can be used to get a
parented tree's siblings.  If a tree does not have a left or right
sibling, then the corresponding method's value is ``None``:

    >>> for subtree in ptree.subtrees():
    ...     print subtree
    ...     print '  Left Sibling  = %s' % subtree.left_sibling()
    ...     print '  Right Sibling = %s' % subtree.right_sibling()
    (VP (VERB saw) (NP (DET the) (NOUN dog)))
      Left Sibling  = None
      Right Sibling = None
    (VERB saw)
      Left Sibling  = None
      Right Sibling = (NP (DET the) (NOUN dog))
    (NP (DET the) (NOUN dog))
      Left Sibling  = (VERB saw)
      Right Sibling = None
    (DET the)
      Left Sibling  = None
      Right Sibling = (NOUN dog)
    (NOUN dog)
      Left Sibling  = (DET the)
      Right Sibling = None

A parented tree's root tree can be accessed using the `root()`
method.  This method follows the tree's parent pointers until it
finds a tree without a parent.  If a tree does not have a parent, then
it is its own root:

    >>> for subtree in ptree.subtrees():
    ...     print subtree
    ...     print '  Root = %s' % subtree.root()
    (VP (VERB saw) (NP (DET the) (NOUN dog)))
      Root = (VP (VERB saw) (NP (DET the) (NOUN dog)))
    (VERB saw)
      Root = (VP (VERB saw) (NP (DET the) (NOUN dog)))
    (NP (DET the) (NOUN dog))
      Root = (VP (VERB saw) (NP (DET the) (NOUN dog)))
    (DET the)
      Root = (VP (VERB saw) (NP (DET the) (NOUN dog)))
    (NOUN dog)
      Root = (VP (VERB saw) (NP (DET the) (NOUN dog)))

The `treeposition()` method can be used to find a tree's treeposition
relative to its root:

    >>> for subtree in ptree.subtrees():
    ...     print subtree
    ...     print '  Tree Position = %s' % (subtree.treeposition(),)
    ...     assert subtree.root()[subtree.treeposition()] is subtree
    (VP (VERB saw) (NP (DET the) (NOUN dog)))
      Tree Position = ()
    (VERB saw)
      Tree Position = (0,)
    (NP (DET the) (NOUN dog))
      Tree Position = (1,)
    (DET the)
      Tree Position = (1, 0)
    (NOUN dog)
      Tree Position = (1, 1)

Whenever a parented tree is modified, all of the methods described
above (`parent()`, `parent_index()`, `left_sibling()`, `right_sibling()`,
`root()`, and `treeposition()`) are automatically updated.  For example,
if we replace ``ptree``\ 's subtree for the word "dog" with a new
subtree for "cat," the method values for both the "dog" subtree and the
"cat" subtree get automatically updated:

    >>> # Replace the dog with a cat
    >>> dog = ptree[1,1]
    >>> cat = ParentedTree('NOUN', ['cat'])
    >>> ptree[1,1] = cat

    >>> # the noun phrase is no longer the dog's parent:
    >>> print dog.parent(), dog.parent_index(), dog.left_sibling()
    None None None
    >>> # dog is now its own root.
    >>> print dog.root()
    (NOUN dog)
    >>> print dog.treeposition()
    ()

    >>> # the cat's parent is now the noun phrase:
    >>> print cat.parent()
    (NP (DET the) (NOUN cat))
    >>> print cat.parent_index()
    1
    >>> print cat.left_sibling()
    (DET the)
    >>> print cat.root()
    (VP (VERB saw) (NP (DET the) (NOUN cat)))
    >>> print cat.treeposition()
    (1, 1)

ParentedTree Regression Tests
-----------------------------
Keep track of all trees that we create (including subtrees) using this
variable:

    >>> all_ptrees = []

Define a helper funciton to create new parented trees:

    >>> def make_ptree(s):
    ...     ptree = ParentedTree.convert(Tree.parse(s))
    ...     all_ptrees.extend(t for t in ptree.subtrees()
    ...                       if isinstance(t, Tree))
    ...     return ptree

Define a test function that examines every subtree in all_ptrees; and
checks that all six of its methods are defined correctly.  If any
ptrees are passed as arguments, then they are printed.

    >>> def pcheck(*print_ptrees):
    ...     for ptree in all_ptrees:
    ...         # Check ptree's methods.
    ...         if ptree.parent() is not None:
    ...             i = ptree.parent_index()
    ...             assert ptree.parent()[i] is ptree
    ...             if i > 0:
    ...                 assert ptree.left_sibling() is ptree.parent()[i-1]
    ...             if i < (len(ptree.parent())-1):
    ...                 assert ptree.right_sibling() is ptree.parent()[i+1]
    ...             assert len(ptree.treeposition()) > 0
    ...             assert (ptree.treeposition() ==
    ...                     ptree.parent().treeposition() + (ptree.parent_index(),))
    ...             assert ptree.root() is not ptree
    ...             assert ptree.root() is not None
    ...             assert ptree.root() is ptree.parent().root()
    ...             assert ptree.root()[ptree.treeposition()] is ptree
    ...         else:
    ...             assert ptree.parent_index() is None
    ...             assert ptree.left_sibling() is None
    ...             assert ptree.right_sibling() is None
    ...             assert ptree.root() is ptree
    ...             assert ptree.treeposition() == ()
    ...         # Check ptree's children's methods:
    ...         for i, child in enumerate(ptree):
    ...             if isinstance(child, Tree):
    ...                 # pcheck parent() & parent_index() methods
    ...                 assert child.parent() is ptree
    ...                 assert child.parent_index() == i
    ...                 # pcheck sibling methods
    ...                 if i == 0:
    ...                     assert child.left_sibling() is None
    ...                 else:
    ...                     assert child.left_sibling() is ptree[i-1]
    ...                 if i == len(ptree)-1:
    ...                     assert child.right_sibling() is None
    ...                 else:
    ...                     assert child.right_sibling() is ptree[i+1]
    ...     if print_ptrees:
    ...         print 'ok!',
    ...         for ptree in print_ptrees: print ptree
    ...     else:
    ...         print 'ok!'

Run our test function on a variety of newly-created trees:

    >>> pcheck(make_ptree('(A)'))
    ok! (A )
    >>> pcheck(make_ptree('(A (B (C (D) (E f)) g) h)'))
    ok! (A (B (C (D ) (E f)) g) h)
    >>> pcheck(make_ptree('(A (B) (C c) (D d d) (E e e e))'))
    ok! (A (B ) (C c) (D d d) (E e e e))
    >>> pcheck(make_ptree('(A (B) (C (c)) (D (d) (d)) (E (e) (e) (e)))'))
    ok! (A (B ) (C (c )) (D (d ) (d )) (E (e ) (e ) (e )))

Run our test function after performing various tree-modification
operations:

**__delitem__()**

    >>> ptree = make_ptree('(A (B (C (D) (E f) (Q p)) g) h)')
    >>> e = ptree[0,0,1]
    >>> del ptree[0,0,1]; pcheck(ptree); pcheck(e)
    ok! (A (B (C (D ) (Q p)) g) h)
    ok! (E f)

MultiParentedTree Regression Tests
----------------------------------
Keep track of all trees that we create (including subtrees) using this
variable:

    >>> all_mptrees = []

Define a helper funciton to create new parented trees:

    >>> def make_mptree(s):
    ...     mptree = MultiParentedTree.convert(Tree.parse(s))
    ...     all_mptrees.extend(t for t in mptree.subtrees()
    ...                       if isinstance(t, Tree))
    ...     return mptree

Define a test function that examines every subtree in all_mptrees; and
checks that all six of its methods are defined correctly.  If any
mptrees are passed as arguments, then they are printed.

    >>> def mpcheck(*print_mptrees):
    ...     def has(seq, val): # uses identity comparison
    ...         for item in seq:
    ...             if item is val: return True
    ...         return False
    ...     for mptree in all_mptrees:
    ...         # Check mptree's methods.
    ...         if len(mptree.parents()) == 0:
    ...             assert len(mptree.left_siblings()) == 0
    ...             assert len(mptree.right_siblings()) == 0
    ...             assert len(mptree.roots()) == 1
    ...             assert mptree.roots()[0] is mptree
    ...             assert mptree.treepositions(mptree) == [()]
    ...             left_siblings = right_siblings = ()
    ...             roots = {id(mptree): 1}

    ...                         if left_siblings[j] is parent[i-1]:
    ...                             del left_siblings[j]
    ...                             break

    ...                 roots[id(root)] += 1
    ...         # check that we don't have any unexplained values

    ...         print 'ok!'

Run our test function on a variety of newly-created trees:

    >>> mpcheck(make_mptree('(A)'))
    ok! (A )
    >>> mpcheck(make_mptree('(A (B (C (D) (E f)) g) h)'))
    ok! (A (B (C (D ) (E f)) g) h)
    >>> mpcheck(make_mptree('(A (B) (C c) (D d d) (E e e e))'))
    ok! (A (B ) (C c) (D d d) (E e e e))
    >>> mpcheck(make_mptree('(A (B) (C (c)) (D (d) (d)) (E (e) (e) (e)))'))
    ok! (A (B ) (C (c )) (D (d ) (d )) (E (e ) (e ) (e )))
    >>> subtree = make_mptree('(A (B (C (D) (E f)) g) h)')

Including some trees that contain multiple parents:

    >>> mpcheck(MultiParentedTree('Z', [subtree, subtree]))
    ok! (Z (A (B (C (D ) (E f)) g) h) (A (B (C (D ) (E f)) g) h))

Run our test function after performing various tree-modification
operations (n.b., these are the same tests that we ran for
`ParentedTree`, above; thus, none of these trees actually *uses*
multiple parents.)

Squashed Bugs
=============
This used to cause an infinite loop (fixed in svn 6269):

    >>> tree = Tree.parse('(VP (VERB saw) (NP (DET the) (NOUN cat)))')
    >>> tree < None
    False

This used to discard the ``(B b)`` subtree (fixed in svn 6270):

    >>> print Tree.parse('((A a) (B b))')
    ( (A a) (B b))
