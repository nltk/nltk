WordNet Interface
=================

The WordNet interface is new in NLTK 0.9.6.  To help with transition, information about the older
pywordnet-based version is retained here.

WordNet is now just another NLTK corpus reader, and can be imported like this:

    >>> from nltk.corpus import wordnet as wn

-----
Words
-----

Look up a word using ``synsets()``; this function has an optional ``pos`` argument
which lets you constrain the part of speech of the word:

    >>> wn.synsets('dog') # doctest: +ELLIPSIS +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    [Synset('dog.n.01'), Synset('frump.n.01'), Synset('dog.n.03'), Synset('cad.n.01'),
    Synset('frank.n.02'), Synset('pawl.n.01'), Synset('andiron.n.01'), Synset('chase.v.01')]
    >>> wn.synsets('dog', pos=wn.VERB)
    [Synset('chase.v.01')]

The other parts of speech are ``NOUN``, ``ADJ`` and ``ADV``.
A synset is identified with a 3-part name of the form: word.pos.nn:

    >>> wn.synset('dog.n.01')
    Synset('dog.n.01')
    >>> wn.synset('dog.n.01').definition
    'a member of the genus Canis (probably descended from the common wolf) that has been domesticated by man since prehistoric times; occurs in many breeds'
    >>> wn.synset('dog.n.01').examples
    ['the dog barked all night']
    >>> wn.synset('dog.n.01').lemmas
    [Lemma('dog.n.01.dog'), Lemma('dog.n.01.domestic_dog'), Lemma('dog.n.01.Canis_familiaris')]
    >>> [lemma.name for lemma in wn.synset('dog.n.01').lemmas]
    ['dog', 'domestic_dog', 'Canis_familiaris']
    >>> wn.lemma('dog.n.01.dog').synset
    Synset('dog.n.01')

Original API
------------

A `Word` is an index into the database. More specifically, a list of
the Senses of the supplied word string. These senses can be accessed
via index notation ``word[n]`` or via the ``word.getSenses()`` method.

    >>> from nltk.wordnet import *
    
    >>> N['dog']
    dog (noun)
    >>> N.word('dog')
    dog (noun)
    >>> N['dog'].pos
    'noun'
    >>> N['dog'].form
    'dog'
    >>> N['dog'].taggedSenseCount
    1
    >>> N['dog'].synsets()
    [{noun: dog, domestic_dog, Canis_familiaris}, {noun: frump, dog}, {noun: dog}, {noun: cad, bounder, blackguard, dog, hound, heel}, {noun: frank, frankfurter, hotdog, hot_dog, dog, wiener, wienerwurst, weenie}, {noun: pawl, detent, click, dog}, {noun: andiron, firedog, dog, dog-iron}]
    >>> N['dog'].isTagged()
    True
    >>> str(N['dog'])
    'dog (noun)'




-------
Synsets
-------

`Synset`: a set of synonyms that share a common meaning.

    >>> dog = wn.synset('dog.n.01')
    >>> dog.hypernyms()
    [Synset('domestic_animal.n.01'), Synset('canine.n.02')]
    >>> dog.hyponyms() # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    [Synset('puppy.n.01'), Synset('great_pyrenees.n.01'), Synset('basenji.n.01'), ...]
    >>> dog.member_holonyms()
    [Synset('pack.n.06'), Synset('canis.n.01')]
    >>> dog.root_hypernyms()
    [Synset('entity.n.01')]

Each synset contains one or more lemmas, which represent a specific
sense of a specific word.

Original API
------------

Senses can be retrieved via
synset.senses() or through the index notations synset[0],
synset[string], or synset[word]. Synsets are related to other
synsets, and we can get a dictionary of relations using the
relations() function.

    >>> N['dog'][0]
    {noun: dog, domestic_dog, Canis_familiaris}

    >>> N['dog'][0].relations()
    {'hypernym': [{noun: canine, canid}, {noun: domestic_animal, domesticated_animal}], 'part holonym': [{noun: flag}], 'member meronym': [{noun: Canis, genus_Canis}, {noun: pack}], 'hyponym': [{noun: puppy}, {noun: pooch, doggie, doggy, barker, bow-wow}, {noun: cur, mongrel, mutt}, {noun: lapdog}, {noun: toy_dog, toy}, {noun: hunting_dog}, {noun: working_dog}, {noun: dalmatian, coach_dog, carriage_dog}, {noun: basenji}, {noun: pug, pug-dog}, {noun: Leonberg}, {noun: Newfoundland, Newfoundland_dog}, {noun: Great_Pyrenees}, {noun: spitz}, {noun: griffon, Brussels_griffon, Belgian_griffon}, {noun: corgi, Welsh_corgi}, {noun: poodle, poodle_dog}, {noun: Mexican_hairless}]}

    >>> N['dog'][0].relations()[HYPERNYM]
    [{noun: canine, canid}, {noun: domestic_animal, domesticated_animal}]

    >>> N['dog'][0][HYPERNYM]
    [{noun: canine, canid}, {noun: domestic_animal, domesticated_animal}]

    >>> len(N['dog'][0])
    3
    >>> N['cat'][6]
    {noun: big_cat, cat}

hypernyms(self):
Get the set of parent hypernym synsets of this synset.

closure(HYPERNYM):
Get the path(s) from this synset to the root, where each path is a
list of the synset nodes traversed on the way to the root.

hypernym_distances(self, distance):
Get the path(s) from this synset to the root, counting the distance
of each node from the initial node on the way. A list of
(synset, distance) tuples is returned.

shortest_path_distance(self, other_synset):
Returns the distance of the shortest path linking the two synsets (if
one exists). For each synset, all the ancestor nodes and their distances
are recorded and compared. The ancestor node common to both synsets that
can be reached with the minimum number of traversals is used. If no
ancestor nodes are common, -1 is returned. If a node is compared with
itself 0 is returned.

getIC(self, freq_data):
Get the Information Content (IC) value of this `Synset`, using
the supplied dict 'freq_data'.

Similarity

    >>> dog = wn.synset('dog.n.01')
    >>> cat = wn.synset('cat.n.01')

``synset1.path_similarity(synset2):``
Return a score denoting how similar two word senses are, based on the
shortest path that connects the senses in the is-a (hypernym/hypnoym)
taxonomy. The score is in the range 0 to 1, except in those cases
where a path cannot be found (will only be true for verbs as there are
many distinct verb taxonomies), in which case -1 is returned. A score of
1 represents identity i.e. comparing a sense with itself will return 1.

    >>> dog.path_similarity(cat)
    0.20000000000000001

``synset1.lch_similarity(synset2):``
Leacock-Chodorow Similarity:
Return a score denoting how similar two word senses are, based on the
shortest path that connects the senses (as above) and the maximum depth
of the taxonomy in which the senses occur. The relationship is given
as -log(p/2d) where p is the shortest path length and d the taxonomy
depth.

    >>> dog.lch_similarity(cat)
    2.0281482472922856

``synset1.wup_similarity(synset2):``
Wu-Palmer Similarity:
Return a score denoting how similar two word senses are, based on the
depth of the two senses in the taxonomy and that of their Least Common
Subsumer (most specific ancestor node). Note that at this time the
scores given do _not_ always agree with those given by Pedersen's Perl
implementation of Wordnet Similarity.

The LCS does not necessarily feature in the shortest path connecting the
two senses, as it is by definition the common ancestor deepest in the
taxonomy, not closest to the two senses. Typically, however, it will so
feature. Where multiple candidates for the LCS exist, that whose
shortest path to the root node is the longest will be selected. Where
the LCS has multiple paths to the root, the longer path is used for
the purposes of the calculation.

Jiang-Conrath Similarity
Return a score denoting how similar two word senses are, based on the

ancestor node) and that of the two input Synsets. The relationship is
given by the equation 1 / (IC(s1) + IC(s2) - 2 * IC(lcs)).

Original API
------------

Dictionary classes, which allow users to access
Wordnet data via a handy dict notation. Also defined are the
low level _IndexFile class and various file utilities, which do the actual
lookups in the Wordnet database files.

Dictionary:
A Dictionary contains all the Words in a given part of speech. Four
dictionaries, bound to N, V, ADJ, and ADV, are bound by default in
__init.py__.

Indexing a dictionary by a string retrieves the word named by that
string, e.g. dict['dog'].  Indexing by an integer n retrieves the
nth word, e.g.  dict[0].  Access by an arbitrary integer is very
slow except in the special case where the words are accessed
sequentially; this is to support the use of dictionaries as the
range of a for statement and as the sequence argument to map and
filter.

    >>> N.pos
    'noun'
    >>> N['dog']
    dog (noun)
    >>> N['inu']
    Traceback (most recent call last):
       ...
    KeyError: "'inu' is not in the 'noun' database"
        
If index is a String, return the Word whose form is
index.  If index is an integer n, return the Word
indexed by the n'th Word in the Index file.
        
    >>> N['dog']
    dog (noun)
    >>> N[0]
    'hood (noun)
 
get(self, key, default=None): Return the Word whose form is key, or default.

    >>> N.get('dog')
    dog (noun)
    >>> N.get('inu')

has_key(self, form): Checks if the supplied argument is an index into
this dictionary. 

    >>> N.has_key('dog')
    True
    >>> N.has_key('inu')
    False
