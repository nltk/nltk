WordNet Interface
=================

WordNet is accessed just another NLTK corpus reader, and can be imported like this:

    >>> from nltk.corpus import wordnet
    
For more compact code, we recommend:

    >>> from nltk.corpus import wordnet as wn

-----
Words
-----

Look up a word using ``synsets()``; this function has an optional ``pos`` argument
which lets you constrain the part of speech of the word:

    >>> wn.synsets('dog') # doctest: +ELLIPSIS +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    [Synset('dog.n.01'), Synset('frump.n.01'), Synset('dog.n.03'), Synset('cad.n.01'),
    Synset('frank.n.02'), Synset('pawl.n.01'), Synset('andiron.n.01'), Synset('chase.v.01')]
    >>> wn.synsets('dog', pos=wn.VERB)
    [Synset('chase.v.01')]

The other parts of speech are ``NOUN``, ``ADJ`` and ``ADV``.
A synset is identified with a 3-part name of the form: word.pos.nn:

    >>> wn.synset('dog.n.01')
    Synset('dog.n.01')
    >>> wn.synset('dog.n.01').definition
    'a member of the genus Canis (probably descended from the common wolf) that has been domesticated by man since prehistoric times; occurs in many breeds'
    >>> wn.synset('dog.n.01').examples
    ['the dog barked all night']
    >>> wn.synset('dog.n.01').lemmas
    [Lemma('dog.n.01.dog'), Lemma('dog.n.01.domestic_dog'), Lemma('dog.n.01.Canis_familiaris')]
    >>> [lemma.name for lemma in wn.synset('dog.n.01').lemmas]
    ['dog', 'domestic_dog', 'Canis_familiaris']
    >>> wn.lemma('dog.n.01.dog').synset
    Synset('dog.n.01')


-------
Synsets
-------

`Synset`: a set of synonyms that share a common meaning.

    >>> dog = wn.synset('dog.n.01')
    >>> dog.hypernyms()
    [Synset('domestic_animal.n.01'), Synset('canine.n.02')]
    >>> dog.hyponyms() # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    [Synset('puppy.n.01'), Synset('great_pyrenees.n.01'), Synset('basenji.n.01'), ...]
    >>> dog.member_holonyms()
    [Synset('pack.n.06'), Synset('canis.n.01')]
    >>> dog.root_hypernyms()
    [Synset('entity.n.01')]

Each synset contains one or more lemmas, which represent a specific
sense of a specific word.

Note that some relations are defined by WordNet only over Lemmas:

    >>> good = wn.synset('good.a.01')
    >>> good.antonyms()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    AttributeError: 'Synset' object has no attribute 'antonyms'
    >>> good.lemmas[0].antonyms()
    [Lemma('bad.a.01.bad')]

The relations that are currently defined in this way are `antonyms`,
`derivationally_related_forms` and `pertainyms`.

Word Senses

    >>> eat = wn.lemma('eat.v.03.eat')
    >>> eat
    Lemma('feed.v.06.eat')
    >>> eat.key
    'eat%2:34:02::'
    >>> eat.count()
    4
    >>> wn.lemma_from_key(eat.key)
    Lemma('feed.v.06.eat')
    >>> wn.lemma_from_key(eat.key).synset
    Synset('feed.v.06')
    >>> wn.lemma_from_key('feebleminded%5:00:00:retarded:00')
    Lemma('backward.s.03.feebleminded')
    >>> for lemma in wn.synset('eat.v.03').lemmas:
    ...     print lemma, lemma.count()
    ...
    Lemma('feed.v.06.feed') 3
    Lemma('feed.v.06.eat') 4
    >>> for lemma in wn.lemmas('eat', 'v'):
    ...     print lemma, lemma.count()
    ...
    Lemma('eat.v.01.eat') 61
    Lemma('eat.v.02.eat') 13
    Lemma('feed.v.06.eat') 4
    Lemma('eat.v.04.eat') None
    Lemma('consume.v.05.eat') None
    Lemma('corrode.v.01.eat') None

Lemmas can also have relations between them:

    >>> vocal = wn.lemma('vocal.a.01.vocal')
    >>> vocal.derivationally_related_forms()
    [Lemma('vocalize.v.02.vocalize')]
    >>> vocal.pertainyms()
    [Lemma('voice.n.02.voice')]
    >>> vocal.antonyms()
    [Lemma('instrumental.a.01.instrumental')]

The three relations above exist only on lemmas, not on synsets.

Verb Frames
-----------

    >>> wn.synset('think.v.01').frame_ids
    [5, 9]
    >>> for lemma in wn.synset('think.v.01').lemmas:
    ...     print lemma, lemma.frame_ids
    ...     print lemma.frame_strings
    ...
    Lemma('think.v.01.think') [5, 9]
    ['Something think something Adjective/Noun', 'Somebody think somebody']
    Lemma('think.v.01.believe') [5, 9]
    ['Something believe something Adjective/Noun', 'Somebody believe somebody']
    Lemma('think.v.01.consider') [5, 9]
    ['Something consider something Adjective/Noun', 'Somebody consider somebody']
    Lemma('think.v.01.conceive') [5, 9]
    ['Something conceive something Adjective/Noun', 'Somebody conceive somebody']
    >>> wn.synset('stretch.v.02').frame_ids
    [8]
    >>> for lemma in wn.synset('stretch.v.02').lemmas:
    ...     print lemma, lemma.frame_ids
    ...     print lemma.frame_strings
    ...
    Lemma('stretch.v.02.stretch') [8, 2]
    ['Somebody stretch something', 'Somebody stretch']
    Lemma('stretch.v.02.extend') [8]
    ['Somebody extend something']


----------
Similarity
----------

    >>> dog = wn.synset('dog.n.01')
    >>> cat = wn.synset('cat.n.01')

``synset1.path_similarity(synset2):``
Return a score denoting how similar two word senses are, based on the
shortest path that connects the senses in the is-a (hypernym/hypnoym)
taxonomy. The score is in the range 0 to 1, except in those cases
where a path cannot be found (will only be true for verbs as there are
many distinct verb taxonomies), in which case -1 is returned. A score of
1 represents identity i.e. comparing a sense with itself will return 1.

    >>> dog.path_similarity(cat)
    0.20000000000000001

``synset1.lch_similarity(synset2):``
Leacock-Chodorow Similarity:
Return a score denoting how similar two word senses are, based on the
shortest path that connects the senses (as above) and the maximum depth
of the taxonomy in which the senses occur. The relationship is given
as -log(p/2d) where p is the shortest path length and d the taxonomy
depth.

    >>> dog.lch_similarity(cat)
    2.0281482472922856

``synset1.wup_similarity(synset2):``
Wu-Palmer Similarity:
Return a score denoting how similar two word senses are, based on the
depth of the two senses in the taxonomy and that of their Least Common
Subsumer (most specific ancestor node). Note that at this time the
scores given do _not_ always agree with those given by Pedersen's Perl
implementation of Wordnet Similarity.

The LCS does not necessarily feature in the shortest path connecting the
two senses, as it is by definition the common ancestor deepest in the
taxonomy, not closest to the two senses. Typically, however, it will so
feature. Where multiple candidates for the LCS exist, that whose
shortest path to the root node is the longest will be selected. Where
the LCS has multiple paths to the root, the longer path is used for
the purposes of the calculation.

    >>> dog.wup_similarity(cat)
    0.8571428571428571

``wordnet_ic``
Information Content:
Load an information content file from the wordnet_ic corpus.

    >>> from nltk.corpus import wordnet_ic
    >>> brown_ic = wordnet_ic.ic('ic-brown.dat')
    >>> semcor_ic = wordnet_ic.ic('ic-semcor.dat')

Or you can create an information content dictionary from a corpus (or
anything that has a words() method).

   >>> from nltk.corpus import genesis
   >>> genesis_ic = wn.ic(genesis, False, 0.0)

``synset1.res_similarity(synset2, ic):``
Resnik Similarity:
Return a score denoting how similar two word senses are, based on the
Information Content (IC) of the Least Common Subsumer (most specific
ancestor node).  Note that for any similarity measure that uses
information content, the result is dependent on the corpus used to
generate the information content and the specifics of how the
information content was created.

    >>> dog.res_similarity(cat, brown_ic)
    7.9116665090365768
    >>> dog.res_similarity(cat, genesis_ic)
    8.3222633693905816

``synset1.jcn_similarity(synset2, ic):``
Jiang-Conrath Similarity
Return a score denoting how similar two word senses are, based on the
Information Content (IC) of the Least Common Subsumer (most specific
ancestor node) and that of the two input Synsets. The relationship is
given by the equation 1 / (IC(s1) + IC(s2) - 2 * IC(lcs)).

    >>> dog.jcn_similarity(cat, brown_ic)
    0.44977552855167391
    >>> dog.jcn_similarity(cat, genesis_ic)
    0.40657997045227057

``synset1.lin_similarity(synset2, ic):``
Lin Similarity:
Return a score denoting how similar two word senses are, based on the
Information Content (IC) of the Least Common Subsumer (most specific
ancestor node) and that of the two input Synsets. The relationship is
given by the equation 2 * IC(lcs) / (IC(s1) + IC(s2)).

    >>> dog.lin_similarity(cat, semcor_ic)
    0.88632886280862277


---------------------
Access to all Synsets
---------------------

Iterate over all the noun synsets:

    >>> for synset in list(wn.all_synsets('n'))[:10]:
    ...     print synset
    ...
    Synset('entity.n.01')
    Synset('physical_entity.n.01')
    Synset('abstraction.n.06')
    Synset('thing.n.12')
    Synset('object.n.01')
    Synset('whole.n.02')
    Synset('congener.n.03')
    Synset('living_thing.n.01')
    Synset('organism.n.01')
    Synset('benthos.n.02')

Get all synsets for this word, possibly restricted by POS:

    >>> wn.synsets('dog') # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    [Synset('dog.n.01'), Synset('frump.n.01'), Synset('dog.n.03'), Synset('cad.n.01'), ...]
    >>> wn.synsets('dog', pos='v')
    [Synset('chase.v.01')]

Walk through the noun synsets looking at their hypernyms:

    >>> from itertools import islice
    >>> for synset in islice(wn.all_synsets('n'), 5):
    ...     print synset, synset.hypernyms()
    ...
    Synset('entity.n.01') []
    Synset('physical_entity.n.01') [Synset('entity.n.01')]
    Synset('abstraction.n.06') [Synset('entity.n.01')]
    Synset('thing.n.12') [Synset('physical_entity.n.01')]
    Synset('object.n.01') [Synset('physical_entity.n.01')]

Morphy
------

Look up forms not in WordNet, with the help of Morphy:

    >>> wn.morphy('denied', wn.NOUN)
    >>> wn.morphy('denied', wn.VERB)
    'deny'
    >>> wn.synsets('denied', wn.NOUN)
    []
    >>> wn.synsets('denied', wn.VERB) # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE 
    [Synset('deny.v.01'), Synset('deny.v.02'), Synset('deny.v.03'), Synset('deny.v.04'),
    Synset('deny.v.05'), Synset('traverse.v.03'), Synset('deny.v.07')]

Bug 85: morphy returns the base form of a word, if it's input is given
as a base form for a POS for which that word is not defined:
