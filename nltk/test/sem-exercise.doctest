:Title: Semantics Exercises

The first lot of exercises concentrate on translating simple English expressions into 
logical form and checking that they are parsable by the
``LogicParser`` in NLTK. If you have experience of this kind of
translation exercise, you may still find it useful to check that you
understand the syntax expected by the parser.


First, start off Python. Usually, you can just type ``python`` at the
prompt in a terminal window. However, you can also type ``idle``,
which will give you the Python editor, and offers a bit more
flexibility. Alternatively, your favourite editor (e.g., emacs or vi)
has almost certainly got a Python mode which will allow you to use
familiar editing commands.

Once you have the Python interpreter running, give it the following instruction:

    >>> from nltk.sem import *
    >>> lp = LogicParser()

Logical Form: Propositions
--------------------------

Translate the following English sentences into propositional logic and
verify that they parse with ``LogicParser``. Provide a key which
shows how the propositional variables in your translation correspond
to expressions of English.

Here's an example to get you started.

(1.1) If Kim sings, it is not the case that Lee sings.

Key: k = 'Kim sings', l = 'Lee sings'

    >>> lp.parse('(k implies (not l))')
    ApplicationExpression('(implies k)', '(not l)')

This output provides some information about the kind of expression
that the parser has recognized, namely an
``ApplicationExpression``. In order to suppress this, use ``print``:
    
    >>> print lp.parse('(k implies (not l))')
    (implies k (not l))

In order to get the Boolean connectives in infix notation, we can
invoke the ``infixify()`` method:
    
    >>> print lp.parse('(k implies (not l))').infixify()
    (k implies (not l))

.. Note::

    If the parser gives an error or an unexpected result, the most likely
    reason is that you have omitted some brackets or added in some
    superfluous ones (or , in later examples, omitted a period immediately
    after a variable-binding expression).

    In some cases, the parser ends
    up in a confused state, and will give unpredictable results. If this
    happens, you can create a new parser instance with

	>>> lp = LogicParser()

    Alternatively, in place of using ``lp.parse(s)`` on a string ``s``, try
    ``LogicParser(s).next()``.

An alternative English rendering of the meaning in (1.1) might be:

(1.2) Lee doesn't sing if Kim does.

This could receive the same translation, namely
``'(k implies (not l))'``. There is another possible interpretation
however: ``'(not (k implies l))'``. In other words, the scope of the
negation could either 
be restricted to Lee's singing, or else be the whole implication. So
in the case of ambiguity, you can give one or more of several possible
answers. 

Now try the following:

(1.3)  Fido runs and barks.

..
    >>> print lp.parse('(fidorun and fidobark)').infixify()
    (fidorun and fidobark)

(1.4)  It will snow if it doesn't rain.

..
    >>> print lp.parse('((not rain) implies snow)').infixify()
    ((not rain) implies snow)

(1.5)  It's not the case that Suzie will be happy if Peter or Rob comes.

..
    >>> print lp.parse('(not ((petecome or robcome) implies suziehappy))').infixify()
    (not ((petecome or robcome) implies suziehappy))

(1.6) Kim didn't cough or sneeze.

..
    >>> print lp.parse('(not (kimcough or kimsneeze))').infixify()
    (not (kimcough or kimsneeze))

(1.7) If you don't come if I call, I won't come if you call.

..
    >>> print lp.parse('((not (icall implies youcome)) implies (not (youcall implies icome)))').infixify()
    ((not (icall implies youcome)) implies (not (youcall implies icome)))


Logical Form: Relations
-----------------------

In the next example, we have decomposed the clauses into predicates
and arguments:

(2.1) Lee likes Fido and Kim hates Rover.

    >>> print lp.parse('((like fido lee) and (hate rover kim))').infixify()
    ((like fido lee) and (hate rover kim))

Here are some more examples for you to translate in a similar
fashion. Don't try to be too faithful to the English; getting a
'correct' analysis in terms of compositional semantics can be quite
subtle.

(2.2) Lee is taller than Kim.

..
    >>> print lp.parse('(taller kim lee)').infixify()
    (taller kim lee)

(2.3) Fluffy washes herself.

..
    >>> print lp.parse('(wash fluffy fluffy)').infixify()
    (wash fluffy fluffy)
        
(2.4) Dana saw Seth, but Kim didn't.

..
    >>> print lp.parse('((saw seth dana) and (not (saw seth kim)))').infixify()
    ((saw seth dana) and (not (saw seth kim)))

(2.5) Fido is a fourlegged friend.

..
    >>> print lp.parse('((fourlegged fido) and (friend fido))').infixify()
    ((fourlegged fido) and (friend fido))

(2.6) Lee and Claude are near each other.

..
    >>> print lp.parse('((near claude lee) and (near lee claude))').infixify()
    ((near claude lee) and (near lee claude))


Logical Form: Quantifiers
-------------------------

Here's the standard example of a quantified sentence with two readings:

(3.1) Everybody loves somebody.

    >>> print lp.parse('some x. all y. (love x y)')
    some x.all y.(love x y)
    >>> print lp.parse('all y. some x. (love x y)')    
    all y.some x.(love x y)

Give translations of the following English examples. For some of them,
you may want to use the connective ``'iff'``, which stands for the
biconditional.


(3.2) Kim loves someone and someone loves Kim.

..
    >>> print lp.parse('(some x. (love x kim) and some y. (love kim y))').infixify()
    (some x.(love x kim) and some y.(love kim y))

(3.3) Kim loves someone who loves Kim.

..
    >>> print lp.parse('(some x. (love x kim) and (love kim x))').infixify()
    (some x.(love x kim) and (love kim x))

(3.4) Nobody loves Kim.

..
    >>> print lp.parse('(not some x. (love kim x))').infixify()
    (not some x.(love kim x))

(3.5) Somebody coughs and sneezes.

..
   >>> print lp.parse('some x. ((cough x) and (sneeze x))').infixify()
   some x.((cough x) and (sneeze x))

(3.6) Nobody coughed or sneezed.

..
   >>> print lp.parse('(not some x. ((cough x) or (sneeze x)))').infixify()
   (not some x.((cough x) or (sneeze x)))

(3.7) Kim loves somebody other than Kim.

..
   >>> print lp.parse('(some x. (love x kim) and (not (x = kim)))').infixify()
   (some x.(love x kim) and (not (x = kim)))

(3.8) Nobody other than Kim loves Lee.

..
    >>> print lp.parse('all x. (not (x = kim) iff (not (love lee x)))').infixify()
    all x.((not (x = kim)) iff (not (love lee x)))

(3.9) Kim loves everyone except for Lee.

..
    >>> print lp.parse('(all x. (love x kim) iff (not (x = kim)))').infixify()
    (all x.(love x kim) iff (not (x = kim)))


(3.10) Exactly one person walks.

..
    >>> print lp.parse('some x. ((walk x) and all y. ((walk y) implies (y = x)))').infixify()
    some x.((walk x) and all y.((walk y) implies (y = x)))



Logical Form: Lambda Abstracts
------------------------------

Lambda abstraction gives us a method of constructing a function from
any open formula. For example, if we replace ``'fluffy'`` by ``'x'`` in
``'(wash fluffy fluffy)'`` we get three different open formulas:

(4.1)
  (a) (wash x fluffy) --> 'be an x such that Fluffy washes x'
  (b) (wash fluffy x) --> 'be an x such that x washes Fluffy'
  (c) (wash x x) --> 'be an x such that x washes x'

These cannot be given a truth value unless we first specify a semantic
value for ``'x'``. However, the variable can be bound by lambda, and
the result is a function expression whose type is IND |rarr| BOOL.

(4.2)
  (a) \\x. (wash x fluffy) --> 'be an x such that Fluffy washes x'
  (b) \\x. (wash fluffy x) --> 'be an x such that x washes Fluffy'
  (c) \\x. (wash x x) --> 'be an x such that x washes x'

Can you think of more idiomatic translations of these?

We also parse expressions like these:

    >>> print lp.parse('\\x. (wash x x)').infixify()
    \x.(wash x x)

Because ``'\'`` is interpreted as a special character in Python, we
either have to escape it with another ``'\'`` as just shown, or else
use so-called raw strings of the form ``r'...'``, as here:
 
    >>> print lp.parse(r'\x. (wash x x)').infixify()
    \x.(wash x x)

Give translations for the following using lambda abstraction.

(4.3) feed Fido and give Rover water

..
    >>> print lp.parse('\\x. ((feed fido x) and (give rover water x))').infixify()
    \x.((feed fido x) and (give rover water x))
    
(4.4) be given 'War and Peace' by Kim

..
    >>> print lp.parse('\\x. (give x wp kim)')
    \x.(give x wp kim)

(4.5) be loved by everyone

..
    >>> print lp.parse('\\x. all y. (love x y)')
    \x.all y.(love x y)

(4.6) be loved or hated by everyone

..
    >>> print lp.parse('\\x. all y. ((love x y) or (hate x y))')
    \x.all y.(or (love x y) (hate x y))


(4.7)  be loved by everyone and hated by no-one

..
    >>> print lp.parse('\\x. (all y. (love x y) and (not some z. (hate x z)))')
    \x.(and all y.(love x y) (not some z.(hate x z)))
    

Logical Form: Lambdas and Function Application
----------------------------------------------

Since lambda abstracts are functors, they can be applied to arguments,
yielding an ``ApplicationExpression``:

    >>> lp.parse('(\\x. (love x kim) fido)')
    ApplicationExpression('\x.(love x kim)', 'fido')

To carry out beta-conversion, we call the ``simplify()`` method on the
expression, as shown here.

    >>> print lp.parse('(\\x. (love x kim) fido)').simplify()
    (love fido kim)

When working with lambda abstracts, it is often convenient to build up
the expressions in stepwise fashion. Here's a couple of methods for
doing this. First, we can build the parse expressions one by one, and
then use the ``ApplicationExpression`` constructor to do the application:

    >>> e1 = lp.parse('\\x. all y. (love x y)')
    >>> e2 = lp.parse('kim')
    >>> e3 = ApplicationExpression(e1, e2)
    >>> print e3.simplify()
    all y.(love kim y)

A second technique works on the string level, and uses string interpolation.
Recall that we can use ``'%s'`` as a placeholder in a string, and then
apply the ``%`` operator to this string and a tuple of fillers to get
a complete string.

    >>> b = 'beans'
    >>> t = 'toast'
    >>> 'I love %s on %s' % (b, t)
    'I love beans on toast'

Here's how we do the same thing with lambda abstracts:
       
    >>> s1 = '\\x. all y. (love x y)'
    >>> s2 = 'kim'
    >>> s3 = '(%s %s)' % (s1, s2)
    >>> s3
    '(\\x. all y. (love x y) kim)'
    >>> print lp.parse(s3).simplify()
    all y.(love kim y)

You can use whichever approach you like, but in the following
exercises, we'll stick to the first method. What you have to do is
find a value for ``e1`` such that a given reduction holds. Here's an example:

..
    >>> e1 = lp.parse('\\x. some y. (love y x)')

(5.1)
    
    >>> e2 = lp.parse('kim')
    >>> e3 = ApplicationExpression(e1, e2)
    >>> print e3.simplify()
    some y.(love y kim)

So one possible answer in this case is

    >>> e1 = lp.parse('\\x. some y. (love y x)')

Now try the following. As well as finding ``e1``, provide an English
version of the final output.

..
    >>> e1 = lp.parse('\\x. some y. ((love y x) or (love x y))')

(5.2)
    
    >>> e2 = lp.parse('kim')
    >>> e3 = ApplicationExpression(e1, e2)
    >>> print e3.infixify().simplify()
    some y.((love y kim) or (love kim y))

..
    >>> e1 = lp.parse('\\x. (some y. (love y x) or all z. (love x z))')

(5.3)
    
    >>> e2 = lp.parse('kim')
    >>> e3 = ApplicationExpression(e1, e2)
    >>> print e3.infixify().simplify()
    (some y.(love y kim) or all z.(love kim z))

..
    >>> e1 = lp.parse('\\x. ((not some y. (love y x)) or (love x x))')

(5.3)
    
    >>> e2 = lp.parse('kim')
    >>> e3 = ApplicationExpression(e1, e2)
    >>> print e3.infixify().simplify()
    ((not some y.(love y kim)) or (love kim kim))


..
    >>> e1 = lp.parse('\\x. (walk fido)')

(5.4)
    
    >>> e2 = lp.parse('kim')
    >>> e3 = ApplicationExpression(e1, e2)
    >>> print e3.simplify()
    (walk fido)


Logical Form: Higher-order Abstraction
--------------------------------------

So far, we have only looked at individual variables being bound by
lambda. However, much of the power of the lambda calculus depends on
being able to bind variables over function expressions. We follow
standard practice in using upper-case letters for variables over
functors. In particular, ``'P'``, ``'Q'``, ``'R'`` are variables over
expressions of type IND |rarr| (IND |rarr| ... (IND |rarr| BOOL)...)). Here's a
simple example:

    >>> print lp.parse('(\\P. (P kim fido) love)').simplify()
    (love kim fido)

We can loosely paraphrase ``'\P. (P kim fido)'`` as 'be a property *P*
such that *P* holds between Fido and Kim'. Here's a slightly more
complex example:

    
    >>> print lp.parse('(\\P. all x. (P x kim) love)').simplify()
    all x.(love x kim)

In the cases we looked at so far, the result of function application
has been an expression of type BOOL. However, it doesn't have to be
this way. Consider the following example:

    >>> e1 = lp.parse('\\P. \\x. (P kim x)')
    >>> e2 = lp.parse('chase')
    >>> e3 = ApplicationExpression(e1, e2)
    >>> print e3.infixify().simplify()
    \x.(chase kim x)

Here, the result after beta-reduction is itself a lambda abstract,
corresponding to the VP *chases Kim*.

Incidentally, there is a more succinct notation for multiple lambda
abstraction, as shown here:

    >>> e1 = lp.parse('\\P x. (P kim x)')

..
    >>> e2 = lp.parse('chase')
    >>> e3 = ApplicationExpression(e1, e2)
    >>> print e3.infixify().simplify()
    \x.(chase kim x)

Using lambda abstracts with variables over functions takes us outside first-order
logic. However, we are going to assume that such lambda abstracts
never enter into interpreted sentences of the semantic
representation. Instead, they are always removed by beta-reduction,
and serve as a kind of 'glue language' for assembling semantic
representations in a compositional manner.

Now, find an ``e1`` that gives the following results:

..
    >>> e1 = lp.parse('\\P. \\x. all y. ((dog y) implies (P kim x))')

(6.1)

    >>> e2 = lp.parse('chase')
    >>> e3 = ApplicationExpression(e1, e2)
    >>> print e3.infixify().simplify()
    \x.all y.((dog y) implies (chase kim x))


..
    >>> e1 = lp.parse('\\P. \\x. some y. ((dog y) and (P x kim))')

(6.2)

    >>> e2 = lp.parse('chase')
    >>> e3 = ApplicationExpression(e1, e2)
    >>> print e3.infixify().simplify()
    \x.some y.((dog y) and (chase x kim))


..
    >>> e1 = lp.parse('\\P. \\x0. \\x1. some y. ((present y) and (give x0 y x1))')

(6.3)

    >>> e2 = lp.parse('give')
    >>> e3 = ApplicationExpression(e1, e2)
    >>> print e3.infixify().simplify()
    \x0 x1.some y.((present y) and (give x0 y x1))


Let's suppose that we translate the verb *barks* as the
non-logical constant ``'bark'``, or equivalently as ``'\x. (bark x)'``.
How are we going to translate  *every dog* in such a way
that the correct translation for *every dog barks* results from a
function application involving the translations of *every dog* and
*walks*?  In the tradition of Montague grammar, we do it like
this:

    >>> e1 = lp.parse('\\P. all x. ((dog x) implies (P x))')
    >>> e2 = lp.parse('bark')
    >>> e3 = ApplicationExpression(e1, e2)
    >>> print e3.infixify().simplify()
    all x.((dog x) implies (bark x))


Now, find ``e1`` such that the following hold:

..
    >>> e1 = lp.parse('\\P. some y. ((dog x) and (P x))')

(6.4)

    >>> e2 = lp.parse('bark')
    >>> e3 = ApplicationExpression(e1, e2)
    >>> print e3.infixify().simplify()
    some y.((dog x) and (bark x))

..
    >>> e1 = lp.parse('\\P. (P fido)')

(6.5)

    >>> e2 = lp.parse('bark')
    >>> e3 = ApplicationExpression(e1, e2)
    >>> print e3.infixify().simplify()
    (bark fido)


In this case, we are treating the subject as the functor and the verb
as the argument. Devise a translation for *barks* that makes it the
functor and the subject the argument. In other words, find an
appropriate value of *e1* for the following result to be obtained:

..
    >>> e1 = lp.parse('\\X.(X bark)')

(6.1)
    
    >>> e2 = lp.parse('\\P. all x. ((dog x) implies (P x))')
    >>> e3 = ApplicationExpression(e1, e2)
    >>> print e3.infixify().simplify()
    all x.((dog x) implies (bark x))
