NLTK Interface to Theorem Provers
---------------------------------

The module ``nltk_contrib/theorem_prover/prover.py`` can be used to access the 
theorem provers.  The module contains a method ``attempt_proof()`` that takes 
an ``Expression`` and, optionally, a name of a theorem prover.  The default is 
``'Prover9'`` , but the tableau prover may be used by specifying ``'tableau'``.

    >>> from nltk_contrib.theorem_prover import prover
    >>> from nltk_contrib.drt import DRT
    >>> f = DRT.Parser().parse('drs([],[(drs([],[(man x)]) implies drs([],[(man x)]))])').toFol()
    >>> print f
    (implies (man x) (man x))
    >>> prover.attempt_proof(f)
    True

Prover9 Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can download Prover9 from http://www.cs.unm.edu/~mccune/prover9/.

.. Extract the source code into '/usr/share/nltk/tools/prover/'.

Extract the source code into a suitable directory and follow the
instructions in the ``README.make`` file to compile the executables.
Install these into an appropriate location. To see where the
``prover`` module will look by default on Unix-like system, you can
inspect the ``_prover9_search`` variable:

    >>> from nltk_contrib.theorem_prover import prover
    >>> prover._prover9_search
    ['.', '/usr/local/bin', '/usr/local/prover9', '/usr/local/share/prover9']

In order to make sure that NLTK knows where to find Prover9, use the
``config_prover9()`` function.

    >>> prover.config_prover9()
    [Found Prover9: /usr/local/bin/prover9]

You can also give an explicit path to this function. 

    >>> prover.config_prover9('/usr/local/bin')
    [Found Prover9: /usr/local/bin/prover9]

..   zap the global variable

      >>> prover._prover9_path = None

If the path is incorrect, ``config_prover9()`` will raise an error.

    >>> prover.config_prover9('/nonexistent/path')    
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      . . .
    LookupError: Unable to find Prover9 executable in '/nonexistent/path'
    Use 'config_prover9(path=<path>) ', or set the PROVER9HOME environment variable to a valid path.

DRS Equality
------------

The theorem prover functionality can be used in NLTK to check whether
two Discourse Representation Structures (DRSs) are logically equivalent.
The ``tp_equals()`` method calls Prover9 to determine whether the
FOL versions of the two DRSs are logically equivalent.

    >>> from nltk_contrib.drt import DRT
    >>> a = DRT.Parser().parse(r'drs([x],[(man x), (walks x)])')
    >>> b = DRT.Parser().parse(r'drs([x],[(walks x), (man x)])')
    >>> print a.tp_equals(b)
    True

Use
~~~

Checking for equality of two DRSs is very useful when generating readings of a sentence.
For example, the ``drt_glue`` module generates two readings for the sentence 
'John sees Mary':

    >>> from nltk_contrib.gluesemantics import drt_glue
    >>> readings = drt_glue.parse_to_meaning('John sees Mary')
    >>> 
    >>> for drs in readings: print drs.simplify()
    ...
    drs([z1,x],[(= z1 John),(= x Mary),(sees z1 x)])
    drs([z2,x],[(= z2 Mary),(= x John),(sees x z2)])

However, it is easy to tell that these two readings are logially the same, and 
therefore, we have no need to keep both of them.  We can use the theorem prover
to determine that they are the same, and then delete one of them.

    >>> readings[0].tp_equals(readings[1])
    True
