"""
Classes and interfaces for labeling tokens with category labels (or
X{class labels}).  Typically, labels are represented with strings
(such as C{'health'} or C{'sports'}).  Classifiers can be used to
perform a wide range of classification tasks.  For example,
classifiers can be used...

  - to classify documents by topic.
  - to classify ambiguous words by which word sense is intended.
  - to classify acoustic signals by which phoneme they represent.
  - to classify sentences by their author.

Features
========
In order to decide which category label is appropriate for a given
token, classifiers examine one or more 'features' of the token.  These
X{features} are typically chosen by hand, and indicate which aspects
of the token are relevant to the classification decision.  For
example, a document classifier might use a separate feature for each
word, recording how often that word occured in the document.

Featuresets
===========
The features describing a token are encoded using a X{featureset},
which is a dictionary that maps from X{feature names} to X{feature
values}.  Feature names are unique strings that indicate what aspect
of the token is encoded by the feature.  Examples include
C{'prevword'}, for a feature whose value is the previous word; and
C{'contains-word(library)'} for a feature that is true when a document
contains the word C{'library'}.  Feature values are typically
booleans, numbers, or strings, depending on which feature they
describe.

Featuresets are typically constructed using a X{feature
extraction function}, which takes a token as its input, and returns a
featuresets describing that token.  This feature extraction
function is applied to each token before it is fed to the classifier:

    >>> # Define a feature extraction function.
    >>> def document_features(document):
    ...     return dict([('contains-word(%s)'%w,True) for w in document])

    >>> Classify each Gutenberg document.
    >>> for file in gutenberg.files():
    ...     doc = gutenberg.tokenized(file)
    ...     print doc_name, classifier.classify(document_features(doc))

Training Classifiers
====================
Most classifiers are built by training them on a list of hand-labeled
examples, known as the X{training set}.  Training sets are represented
as lists of C{(featuredict, label)} tuples.
