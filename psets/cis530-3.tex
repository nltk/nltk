Please read the tutorials on \emph{Tagging} and \emph{Writing Classes
for NLTK}.

{\bf Accessing NLTK.}  
To access the centrally installed version of NLTK on unagi you will
need to have\\ \texttt{/spd25/cis530/nltk/src} in your PYTHONPATH (see
Lutz pp20ff).  If you are working from your own copy of NLTK, it will
be necessary to download the current version (0.2); please see the
course website for details.

{\bf Grading.}  
Points will be awarded for well-structured and well-documented code.
Points will be deducted for late submissions.  Assignments must be
strictly original work.

{\bf Submission.}  
Please email your completed assignment as a
\emph{single Python program} to both instructors
\texttt{sb@cis, edloper@gradient.cis}, in the body of the message.
Please use plain ASCII (no zip files or attachments) and ensure
that no lines are longer than 80 characters.

\section{Lexicon and Morphology}

Complete the following questions from Finegan chapter 2, on pp. 64-66:
\emph{(a) 2-1, (b) 2-2, (c) 2-3, (d) 2-9}.  
Save your answers using functions named
\texttt{p1a()}, \texttt{p1b()}, \texttt{p1c()}, and \texttt{p1d()}, which
return formatted text strings.  These functions should have the form:

{\tt
\begin{tabbing}
def p1a():\\
\qquad return """\\
\textit{(place your solution here)}\\
"""
\end{tabbing}
}

\section{Morphological Analysis}

Wrtie a function, \texttt{p2()}, that uses NLTK to draw trees for each
of the words listed in problem \emph{2-8} of Finegan (chapter 2,
p. 66).  You can use the \texttt{Tree} class to draw trees.  For
example, you could draw the tree found on page 47 of Finegan with the
following Python code:

\begin{verbatim}
from nltk.tree import Tree
t1 = Tree('Adverb',
          Tree('Adjective', 'un',
               Tree('Adjective',
                    Tree('Verb', 'control'),
                    'able')),
          'ly')
t1.draw()
\end{verbatim}

Note that the \texttt{Tree} constructor takes the tree's node value,
followed by a list of children.  Refer to the \texttt{Tree} reference
documentation for more information.  We will cover \texttt{Tree}s in
detail when we discuss parsing.

\section{Syntax}

Complete questions \emph{(a) 5-1} and \emph{(b) 5-2} from Finegan
chapter 5, on pp. 174-175.  Save your answers using functions named
\texttt{p3a()} and \texttt{p3b()}, which return formatted text
strings.  These functions should have the form:

{\tt
\begin{tabbing}
def p3a():\\
\qquad return """\\
\textit{(place your solution here)}\\
"""
\end{tabbing}
}

\section{Syntax Trees}

Write a function, \texttt{p4a()}, that draws each of the trees
requested in problem \emph{5-3} in Finegan (chapter 5, pp. 174-175).
You can use the \texttt{Tree} class to draw trees.  For example, you
could draw the tree for the sentence ``dogs chase cats'' with the
following code:

\begin{verbatim}
from nltk.tree import Tree
t2 = Tree('S',
          Tree('NP', 'dogs'),
          Tree('VP', 
               Tree('V', 'chase'),
               Tree('NP', 'cats')))
t2.draw()
\end{verbatim}

Write a function, \texttt{p4b()}, which returns a formatted
documentation string answering the remaining questions from problem
\emph{5-3}.  This function should have the form:

{\tt
\begin{tabbing}
def p4b():\\
\qquad return """\\
\textit{(place your solution here)}\\
"""
\end{tabbing}
}

\section{Rule-Based Tagging}

NLTK defines the \texttt{NN\_CD\_Tagger}, which is typically used as a
``fall-back'' tagger, to tag unknown words.  It tags tokens as either
numbers (``CD'') or nouns (``NN''), by checking whether their type
matches a simple regular expression.  Although \texttt{NN\_CD\_Tagger}
has decent performance, there is a lot of room for improvement.  For
example, we could tag any word that ends with ``-s'' as a plural noun.
Propose four new rules that could be used to tag unknown words, based
on the contents of their type.

Write a new tagger named \texttt{P5}, which implements these new
rules.  Your code for \texttt{P5} should have the form:

{\tt
\begin{tabbing}
class P5(TaggerI):\\
\qquad def \_\_init\_\_(self):\\
\qquad\qquad $\ldots$\\
\\
\qquad def tag(self, tokens):\\
\qquad\qquad $\ldots$
\end{tabbing}
}

\newpage
You can use the \texttt{accuracy} function in the \texttt{nltk.tagger}
module to test the accuracy of your new tagger.  Since it is generally
advisable to test a system on different data than you train it on, we
suggest that you set aside the first 100 tokens of your training text
for testing.  The following function could be used to test your
tagger:

{\tt
\begin{tabbing}
from nltk.tagger import TaggedTokenizer, untag, accuracy, TaggerI\\
\\
def test\_p5():\\
\qquad tokens = TaggedTokenizer().tokenize(open('taggedcorpus.txt', 'r').read())\\
\qquad tagger = P5()\\
\qquad tagger.train(tokens[100:])\\
\qquad result = tagger.tag(untag(tokens[100:]))\\
\qquad print 'Accuracy', accuracy(tokens[100:], result)
\end{tabbing}
}

You can find tagged corpera in \texttt{/data/brown/} on the
resources CD; or in
\texttt{/spd25/cis530/cdrom/resources/data/brown/} on unagi.

\section{Probablistic Tagging}

NLTK defines the \texttt{NthOrderTagger}, which uses a token's base
type and the predicted tags of the previous $n$ tokens to help predict
each new tag.  In other words, it uses the following context to
predict each tag:

$$context(i) = \langle token_i.basetype, token_{i-1}.tag, \ldots, token_{i-n}.tag\rangle$$

Using this context, \texttt{NthOrderTagger} can tag texts with
relatively high accuracy.  However, it is possible to define taggers
that use many other contexts.  Some examples of alternative contexts
which might yield good results are:

$$context(i) = \langle token_i.basetype, token_{i-1}.basetype\rangle$$
$$context(i) = \langle token_i.basetype, token_{i+1}.basetype\rangle$$
$$context(i) = \langle token_i.basetype, token_{i-1}.basetype, token_{i-1}.tag\rangle$$
$$context(i) = \langle Set(token_{i-2}.basetype, \ldots, token_{i+2}.basetype\rangle$$

Choose one of these contexts, or come up with your own, and use it to
write a probablistic tagger nameed \texttt{P6}.  Your code for
\texttt{P6} should have the form:

{\tt
\begin{tabbing}
class P6(TaggerI):\\
\qquad def \_\_init\_\_(self):\\
\qquad\qquad $\ldots$\\
\\
\qquad def train(self, tagged\_tokens):\\
\qquad\qquad $\ldots$\\
\\
\qquad def tag(self, tokens):\\
\qquad\qquad $\ldots$
\end{tabbing}
}

You can use the \texttt{accuracy} function in the \texttt{nltk.tagger}
module to test the accuracy of your new tagger (see problem 5).
