\maketitle

Preparation: Read the first two chapters of
Lutz \& Ascher {\em Learning Python}.  Run the Python 2.1
interpreter (on CIS machines, this is found in
/pkg/p/Python-2.1.1/bin).  Experiment interactively with
the interpreter as suggested in the book.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Complete the first nine exercises in chapter 2.
  Report answers just for exercises 3, 6 and 9.

\item
  Do the Finegan and Horrocks readings, and make sure you
  understand the contrasts described in the first lecture
  (e.g. prescriptive vs descriptive).  Choose one of the
  contrasts and write a paragraph to explain it.

\end{enumerate}
