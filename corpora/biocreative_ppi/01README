BioCreAtIvE-PPI: a corpus for protein-protein interactions

This corpus originated from the BioCreAtIvE task 1A data set for named
entity recognition of gene/protein names. We randomly selected 1000
sentences from this set and added additional annotation for
interactions between genes/proteins. 173 sentences contain at least
one interaction, 589 sentences contain at least one
gene/protein. There are 255 interactions, some of which include more
than two partners (e.g., one partner occurs with full name and
abbreviated).

 751013 bc_sentences.xml    - 1000 sentences
 751216 bc_sentences_xs.xml - 1000 sentences, with style sheet information
  15248 bc_solution.txt       - gold standard
  15125 bc_pubmeds.txt      - mapping from sentence IDs to PubMed-IDs

Sentences are formatted like

    ..<interactor pos="VBZ">regulates</interactor> <gene>rsmB</gene> <token pos="NN">transcription</token>..

where

    interactor   depicts the evidence for an interaction (with its POS tag)
    gene       denotes a gene or protein (and thus a possible interaction partner)
    token       is an arbitrary token (with its POS tag)

The solution is formatted as follows:

Example: 0006|RsmC|5|rsmB|8|regulates|7|+|comment

    0006       depicts the sentence ID
    RsmC      is the (full) name of the first interaction partner (gene or protein)
    5          is the index of the first partner
    rsmB       name of the second interaction partner
    8          index of the second partner
    regulates   type of interaction, as mentioned in the text
    7          index of type descriptor
    +          agent/target relation: (+, agent=1st partner; -, 2nd is agent; *, equal)
    comment    is an optional comment

Example: 0187|meis1|4|cAMP-responsive sequence;CRS1|13;16|bind|11|+|

    full name and abbreviation occur in the text -> two relations

We copied both tokenization and part-of-speech tagging from the
BioCreAtIvE data set. Note that especially genes and protein names are
tagged as one token (<gene>cAMP-responsive sequence</gene>), but the
indexing counts every single word in such a phrase:

    .. cAMP-responsive sequence (  CRS1 )  ..
    .. 13              14       15 16   17 ..
