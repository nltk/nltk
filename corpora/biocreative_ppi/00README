Task 1.A

The first task (1.A) requires the identification of which terms in a
biomedical research article are gene and/or protein names. This is
analagous to the named entity tagging evaluation (e.g. person, place,
and organization) of the Message Understanding Conference (MUC)
evaluations. Identifying the mentions of the genes and proteins is
foundational to a more deep natural language processing such as
extracting the relationships among genes and proteins (e.g. binding,
inhibition, promotion of expression). This part of the evaluation was
prepared by Lorrie Tanabe and John Wilbur of the National Library of
Medicine.
