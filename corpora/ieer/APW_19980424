	   <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">UNITED NATIONS<e_enamex> (<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">AP<e_enamex>) _ Recalling <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">U.N.<e_enamex> failures in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Africa<e_enamex>,
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Security Council<e_enamex> members said <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex> the international community
must demonstrate the political will to help <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Africa<e_enamex> overcome its
economic and social problems.
	   The calls came during an <b_timex type="DURATION">all-day<e_timex> debate on <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Africa<e_enamex> to review
Secretary-General <b_enamex type="PERSON">Kofi Annan<e_enamex>'s report last week, in which he
outlined goals for the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">United Nations<e_enamex> in assisting the world's most
under-developed continent.
	   In that report, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Annan<e_enamex>, the first sub-Saharan African to head the
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">United Nations<e_enamex>, said African leaders must demonstrate the political
will to combat corruption, protect human rights and pursue sound
economic policies.
	   At the same time, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Annan<e_enamex> said, the international community must
respond by investing in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Africa<e_enamex> and by intervening to end armed
conflicts and restore stability.
	   Echoing <b_enamex type="PERSON">Annan<e_enamex>'s comments, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Portugal<e_enamex>'s <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">U.N.<e_enamex> ambassador, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Antonio
Monteiro<e_enamex>, said ``political will is needed from the international
community'' to help <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Africa<e_enamex> overcome its political problems.
	   ``And will and courage is very much needed to avoid future
situations in which the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">United Nations<e_enamex> is unfortunately seen to
have turned its back on the African people,'' <b_enamex type="PERSON">Monteiro<e_enamex> said.
``Concrete measures should be considered to ensure that the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">United
Nations<e_enamex> and the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Security Council<e_enamex> in particular provide a timely
response to impending crises.''
	   But the council's willingness to intervene in African crises was
weakened by the disastrous failure of the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">U.N.<e_enamex> peacekeeping
operation in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Somalia<e_enamex> in <b_timex type="DATE">1993<e_timex>.
	   The deaths of <b_numex type="CARDINAL">18<e_numex> American soldiers in a gunbattle in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Mogadishu<e_enamex>
in <b_timex type="DATE">1993<e_timex> led the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">United States<e_enamex> to withdraw from the operation and
impose stringent conditions on future <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">U.N.<e_enamex> peacekeeping missions.
	   <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">U.N.<e_enamex> officials have complained those conditions have made it
nearly impossible for the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">United Nations<e_enamex> to respond quickly to
African crises. They point to the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">U.S.<e_enamex> stand as <b_numex type="CARDINAL">one<e_numex> of the main
reasons for the laggard <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">U.N.<e_enamex> response to the <b_timex type="DATE">1994<e_timex> massacre of up to
a <b_numex type="CARDINAL">half million<e_numex> Rwandan Tutsis and moderate Hutus by Hutu
extremists.
	   The <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Security Council<e_enamex> was also unable to intervene decisively in
last year's rebellion in the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Congo<e_enamex>, formerly <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Zaire<e_enamex>, and in the
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Republic of Congo<e_enamex>, where a former dictator overthrew an elected
president.
	   ``The experience of intervention in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Somalia<e_enamex> was a bitter one but
that of non-intervention in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Rwanda<e_enamex> was perhaps worse,'' British
Ambassador <b_enamex type="PERSON">John Weston<e_enamex> told the council.
	   He cited the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">U.N.<e_enamex> success in supervising the transition of
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Eastern Slavonia<e_enamex> from Serb to Croat control as an example of how
the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">United Nations<e_enamex> could be effective ``given the right mandates
and resources.''
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Weston<e_enamex> said proposals for shifting peacekeeping to regional
organizations _ as proposed by the <b_enamex type="PERSON">Clinton<e_enamex> Administration _
``cannot substitute for the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">U.N.<e_enamex>''
	   ``What we need is an active partnership with <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Africa<e_enamex>,'' he said.
	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">France<e_enamex>'s <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">U.N.<e_enamex> ambassador, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Alain Dejammet<e_enamex>, said <b_enamex type="LOCATION">France<e_enamex> was
``prepared to respond and work'' with its <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">U.N.<e_enamex> partners on a more
effective role in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Africa<e_enamex>, despite the French drawdown of military
forces on the continent.
	   The <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Security Council<e_enamex> asked <b_enamex type="PERSON">Annan<e_enamex> to prepare the report following
a meeting on <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Africa<e_enamex> held in <b_timex type="DATE">September<e_timex> during the annual <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">General
Assembly<e_enamex> debate. The <b_enamex type="LOCATION">United States<e_enamex> sought the meeting to draw
international attention to the problems facing <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Africa<e_enamex>.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Annan<e_enamex> said he would deliver that message during a visit to <b_numex type="CARDINAL">eight<e_numex>
African countries _ <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Ethiopia<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Djibouti<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Kenya<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Tanzania<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Rwanda<e_enamex>,
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Burundi<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Uganda<e_enamex> and <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Eritrea<e_enamex> _ starting <b_timex type="DATE">Wednesday<e_timex>.

	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">SHAH ALAM<e_enamex>, <b_timex type="DATE">Thurs.<e_timex> - The <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Selangor Waterworks Department<e_enamex> and the
police have stepped up investigations into the alleged theft of
water by a company, <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Sun Metal Works Sdn Bhd<e_enamex>, a subsidiary of
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Wembley Industries Holdings Bhd<e_enamex>, at <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Jalan Gambus<e_enamex> off <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Jalan Bukit
Kemuning<e_enamex> in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Klang<e_enamex>.
	   The company involved in metal works and production of boilers is
expected to be charged soon under section 38 of the Water Supply
Act <b_timex type="DATE">1997<e_timex> which carries a maximum fine of <b_numex type="MONEY">RM50,000<e_numex> or <b_timex type="DURATION">two years<e_timex>'
jail or both.
	   If the company continues stealing water in spite of the
directive to stop doing so, it will be fined <b_numex type="MEASURE">RM1,000 a day<e_numex>.
	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Shah Alam<e_enamex> district crime chief, Deputy Superintendent <b_enamex type="PERSON">G.
Selvakumar<e_enamex> said police have stepped up their investigations under
section 379 of the Penal Code.
	   The company, which has about <b_numex type="CARDINAL">400<e_numex> permanent and contract
employees, has been in operation at the site for about <b_timex type="DURATION">two years<e_timex>.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Selangor Menteri Besar Datuk Abu Hassan Omar<e_enamex> today said apart
from court action, the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">State Waterworks Department<e_enamex> had been
directed to recover payment, estimated to be about <b_numex type="MONEY">half-a million
ringgit<e_numex>, from the company.
	   ``It is a serious offence to steal water and the company has
been doing this from the time it has been in operation at the site
with an average of <b_numex type="MEASURE">450,000 litres of water a day<e_numex>,'' he told
reporters after opening the 11th <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Selangor Malay Chamber of Commerce
and Industry<e_enamex> annual general meeting at <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Radisson Hotel<e_enamex>.
	   The courts, he added, should also impose deterrent sentences on
those charged with theft of water.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Abu Hassan<e_enamex> said the department has also been ordered to act
immediately on all information received from the public on theft of
water by squatters, individuals and the commercial sector as it
could cost the Government <b_numex type="MONEY">millions of ringgit<e_numex>.
	   Asked why the department did not act on complaints lodged by the
public earlier on theft of water, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Abu Hassan<e_enamex> said he would check
with the authorities but assured the public that all complaints
would be acted upon effective from today.
	   ``The public can also lodge complaints with the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">State Technical
Committee on Water<e_enamex> headed by State Secretary <b_enamex type="PERSON">Datuk Hashim Meon<e_enamex> or
to my office,'' he added.
	   He said the State Government was considering giving rewards to
those with information on theft of water.
	   ``With the present water crisis, every drop of water counts,''
he said adding that the water rationing exercise was being
implemented as planned in all affected areas in Zone A and B.
	   Meanwhile employees at <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Sun Metal Works Sdn Bhd<e_enamex> when interviewed
said that the factory had been deprived of water supply for the
past <b_timex type="DURATION">two days<e_timex>.
	   Attempts to contact the factory officials proved futile.

	   PEOPLE from across the world travel to <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Cherating<e_enamex> on the east
coast of Peninsular <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Malaysia<e_enamex> mainly because <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Club Med<e_enamex> has made it
famous.
	   However, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Cherating<e_enamex>, as many a visitor knows, is more than just
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Club Med<e_enamex>.
	   Within a short radius of <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Pahang<e_enamex>'s top beach spot, you can find
many lovely things to do or see.
	   My second visit to <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Cherating<e_enamex> recently unveiled more places that
I hadn't been to before. It was a <b_timex type="DURATION">weekend<e_timex> well spent; delighting in
the greenery, soaking up the sun and enjoying the leisurely life by
the seaside.
	   My <b_numex type="CARDINAL">two<e_numex> friends from <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Singapore<e_enamex> and I stayed at <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">The Legend Resort<e_enamex>,
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Cherating<e_enamex>, <b_numex type="MEASURE">47km<e_numex> north of <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Kuantan<e_enamex> or <b_timex type="DURATION">45 minutes<e_timex> from <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Kuantan
airport<e_enamex>. If you prefer to drive, it's about <b_timex type="DURATION">five hours<e_timex> from <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Kuala
Lumpur<e_enamex>.
	   At <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Cherating<e_enamex>, there is a wide range of accommodation to choose
from.
	   Depending on your budget, there are top-notch resorts like <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">The
Legend<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Impiana<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Residence Inn<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Holiday Villa Cherating<e_enamex> and the new
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Swiss Garden<e_enamex>, or the affordable chalets rented out by village
folks. Foreigners can also arrange for homestay with locals, for a
fee, of course.
	   <b_numex type="CARDINAL">One<e_numex> of the first places we visited was a fishing village in
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Kuala Kemaman<e_enamex>, on the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Terengganu<e_enamex> side of the border. Our plan to
buy fresh fish did not materialise as <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex> was a day of rest for
the fishermen.
	   Undeterred, we drove around <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Cukai<e_enamex>, a tiny town in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Terengganu<e_enamex>
that's bursting with banks (our guide <b_enamex type="PERSON">Santhi Jayadhan<e_enamex> counted at
least a <b_numex type="CARDINAL">dozen<e_numex>) that service the oil and gas industries. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Santhi<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">The
Legend<e_enamex>'s senior sales manager, has been living in the area for
<b_timex type="DURATION">several years<e_timex> and knows the place like the back of her hand.
	   Next, we arranged to have a tour of the famous <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Club Med<e_enamex> and
noted with delight that there is a soon-to-be-opened turtle
sanctuary and information centre beside the resort. This means city
folks like me don't have to travel to <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Rantau Abang<e_enamex> to see how
turtles are hatched.
	   The following day, we spent an enjoyable morning on a small,
uninhabited island and the afternoon at <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Cherating<e_enamex> village, arranged
by the hotel.
	   However, our guide <b_enamex type="PERSON">Wan Yeh Mahmood<e_enamex> (who is the resort's duty
manager) seemed so enthusiastic that we couldn't possibly chicken
out. As it turned out, the sea was calm and beautiful, and <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Pulau
Ular<e_enamex> (there are no snakes there) was great as a picnic spot.
	   With only a stamp-sized patch of beach, the rocky <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Pulau Ular<e_enamex> is
better suited for fishing and snorkelling. The water was so clear
that tiny fish could be seen swimming near some of the rocks.
	   While we frolicked in the water, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Wan<e_enamex> and the boatman took the
sampan out for a spot of fishing. We were pleased when <b_enamex type="PERSON">Wan<e_enamex> gave us
his catch of a few medium- and small-sized fish. He later arranged
for <b_numex type="CARDINAL">one<e_numex> of the resort's chefs to cook the fish in <b_numex type="CARDINAL">three<e_numex> styles:
steamed, deep-fried, and prepared with delicious ayam percik sauce.
	   According to <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">The Legend<e_enamex>'s general manager, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Kevin Loh<e_enamex>, the
resort's chefs are always willing to help guests, particularly
long-staying ones, to cook their catch after a fishing trip or
after a visit to the fishing village.
	   A trip to the older part of <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Cherating<e_enamex> village - with its
kampung-style chalets, pubs, restaurants and handicraft workshops
and where you can see <b_enamex type="PERSON">Mak De<e_enamex>'s chalet-cum-restaurant - is not to be
missed.
	   ``<b_enamex type="PERSON">Mak Long De<e_enamex>,'' said <b_enamex type="PERSON">Santhi<e_enamex>, ``is an enterprising housewife who
set up the first chalet for rent to tourists in the early <b_timex type="DATE">'60s<e_timex>,
about <b_timex type="DURATION">20 years<e_timex> before <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Club Med<e_enamex> came into the scene.''
	   We didn't get to see <b_enamex type="PERSON">Mak Long De<e_enamex> but we chatted with her
relative, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Pak De<e_enamex>, a sprightly septuagenarian who has trained his
monkey called ``<b_enamex type="PERSON">Salleh<e_enamex>''
	   to pluck coconuts to amuse tourists and for sale. The
<b_numex type="MEASURE">three-year<e_numex>-old berok can pick over <b_numex type="CARDINAL">200<e_numex> coconuts in a <b_timex type="DURATION">day<e_timex>.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Pak De<e_enamex> said it takes him between <b_timex type="DURATION">one<e_timex> and <b_timex type="DURATION">two months<e_timex> to train a
monkey.
	   He charges <b_numex type="MONEY">RM10<e_numex> for the monkey to ``perform'' and <b_numex type="MONEY">RM1<e_numex> for a
coconut.
	   To get a feel of how some locals earn a living, you can also
watch village folks make gula melaka or brown sugar, and visit the
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Cherating Handicraft Centre<e_enamex> where women gather to weave mengkuang
(pandunus) leaves before fashioning them into pretty and functional
items like mats, visors, bags, slippers, letter-holders, baskets,
coasters and hand-held fans.
	   <b_numex type="CARDINAL">One<e_numex> of the latest tourist attractions in the area is the
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Cherating Cultural Complex<e_enamex>, a <b_numex type="MEASURE">one-stop<e_numex> cultural centre where you
can watch craftsmen and women painting batik, weaving mengkuang and
tenun, or see a demonstration of traditional games like
top-spinning, kite-flying, congkak and sepak raga. Or dine at the
restaurant in the complex while enjoying a wayang kulit play or a
traditional dance.
	   Run by the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Kuantan Municipal Council<e_enamex>, the <b_numex type="MONEY">RM1 million<e_numex> complex is
spread over <b_numex type="MEASURE">1.6ha<e_numex> near the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Cherating River<e_enamex>.
	   It had its soft opening last <b_timex type="DATE">June<e_timex> and is still being expanded.
	   Our <b_timex type="DURATION">three-day<e_timex> getaway in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Cherating<e_enamex> finished off with a morning
cruise on the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Cherating River<e_enamex>.
	   I've never ceased to be amazed at the diversity and richness of
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Malaysia<e_enamex>'s flora and fauna. We saw within just a <b_timex type="DURATION">30-minute<e_timex> ride up
and down a portion of <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Cherating River<e_enamex> a few kingfishers, an iguana,
pheasants, monkeys, an eagle and spiders, and enjoyed the natural
music created by cicadas and many birds.
	   Thank goodness we don't have to travel <b_numex type="CARDINAL">half<e_numex>-way across the world
to savour these simple pleasures of life.

Judge says goverment was too sensitive to teacher's math exercise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">BLANTYRE<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Malawi<e_enamex> (<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">AP<e_enamex>) _ A judge said the government was being
too sensitive when it suspended a math teacher for comparing the
size of a coin image of President <b_enamex type="PERSON">Bakili Muluzi<e_enamex> with that of his
predecessor in a class exercise.
	   <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Blantyre High Court<e_enamex> Judge <b_enamex type="PERSON">Eric Kumitsonyo<e_enamex> said <b_timex type="DATE">Thursday<e_timex> that he
could find ``nothing derogatory'' in teacher <b_enamex type="PERSON">Felix Mchamithe<e_enamex>'s
remark that <b_enamex type="PERSON">Muluzi<e_enamex>'s image on a coin was larger than that of the
late dictator <b_enamex type="PERSON">Kamuzu Banda<e_enamex>.
	   ``Is it not true that the face of <b_enamex type="PERSON">Muluzi<e_enamex> fills the coin? And if
it is full, so what?'' <b_enamex type="PERSON">Kumitsonyo<e_enamex> said.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Kumitsonyo<e_enamex> adjourned the hearing and did not indicate when he
will make a ruling.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Mchamithe<e_enamex>, who asked his pupils to measure the images during a
lesson on circumference and circles, sued education authorities for
wrongful dismissal. He said he was suspended for allegedly
insulting <b_enamex type="PERSON">Muluzi<e_enamex> and undermining his presidential authority.
	   The teacher told the court that he made it clear in the
classroom that <b_enamex type="PERSON">Banda<e_enamex>, who died last year at age <b_numex type="MEASURE">99<e_numex>, was a small man
dwarfed by <b_enamex type="PERSON">Muluzi<e_enamex>, who is heavily built.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Muluzi<e_enamex> ousted <b_enamex type="PERSON">Banda<e_enamex> in the first democratic elections in <b_timex type="DATE">1994<e_timex>,
ending <b_enamex type="PERSON">Banda<e_enamex>'s brutal <b_timex type="DURATION">30-year<e_timex> dictatorship.
	   The new ruling party said it would not copy <b_enamex type="PERSON">Banda<e_enamex>'s habit of
putting the president's image on the currency, but <b_enamex type="PERSON">Muluzi<e_enamex>'s face
appeared there after <b_timex type="DURATION">two years<e_timex>.
	   Detectives spent <b_timex type="DURATION">eight hours<e_timex> <b_timex type="DATE">Thursday<e_timex> questioning staff at the
opposition <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Daily Times<e_enamex> over remarks it published describing <b_enamex type="PERSON">Muluzi<e_enamex>
as ``silly,'' the newspaper reported.

negotiations, fears and dashed hopes, the leader of hostages
released in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Somalia<e_enamex> <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex> said he burst into tears when gunmen set
him and his <b_numex type="CARDINAL">nine<e_numex> colleagues free.
	   ``We've gone through ups and downs,'' Swiss <b_enamex type="PERSON">Thomas Gurtner<e_enamex> said.
``We are a group of <b_numex type="CARDINAL">10<e_numex> people, different nationalities, different
cultural backgrounds, but we stuck it out together in a quite
amazing way. We had some difficult moments, but in the end we
survived it.''
	   Relieved relatives cheered and hugged <b_enamex type="PERSON">Gurtner<e_enamex> and <b_numex type="CARDINAL">nine<e_numex> others
when they stepped off the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Red Cross<e_enamex> aircraft from <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Mogadishu<e_enamex>.
	   Other captives included Norwegian <b_enamex type="PERSON">Ola Skuterud<e_enamex>; naturalized
American Somali <b_enamex type="PERSON">Ibrahim Ahmad<e_enamex>; Belgian <b_enamex type="PERSON">Toon Vandenhove<e_enamex>; German
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Christoph Langenkamp<e_enamex>; Swiss <b_enamex type="PERSON">Patrick Berner<e_enamex> and <b_enamex type="PERSON">Markus Fasel<e_enamex>; and
French nurse <b_enamex type="PERSON">Nadine Piantowsky<e_enamex>. <b_numex type="CARDINAL">Two<e_numex> pilots, South African <b_enamex type="PERSON">Robi Byrd<e_enamex>
and Kenyan <b_enamex type="PERSON">Steve Riungu<e_enamex> also were released.
	   The <b_numex type="CARDINAL">10<e_numex> were kidnapped along with a Somali aid worker by renegade
gunmen on <b_timex type="DATE">April 15<e_timex> as soon as their plane touched down in north
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Mogadishu<e_enamex>.
	   From then on, Somali elders and leaders, apparently embarrassed
by the abductions and worried about their impact on the fragile
peace process, were in daily contact with the captors.
	   At <b_numex type="CARDINAL">one<e_numex> point, the kidnappers demanded up to <b_numex type="MONEY">one million dollars<e_numex>.
At the end, no ransom was paid and the hostages were set free
unconditionally, according to the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Red Cross<e_enamex> and Somali leader <b_enamex type="PERSON">Ali
Mahdi Mohamed<e_enamex>.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Bill Grant<e_enamex>, a Somali advisor and a former <b_enamex type="LOCATION">U.S.<e_enamex> congressman from
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Florida<e_enamex>, said <b_numex type="CARDINAL">three<e_numex> families from the Abgal subclan staged the
kidnapping because they felt they were excluded from the
distribution of international aid.
	   Aid workers and foreigners have been kidnapped in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Somalia<e_enamex> by
militiamen eager to make easy money since the country disintegrated
into a fiefdom of clans following the ouster of late dictator
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Mohamed Siad Barre<e_enamex> in <b_timex type="DATE">1991<e_timex>. In the past, aid agencies have refused
to pay ransoms, for fear of causing more
	   Inside a walled north <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Mogadishu<e_enamex> compound, the hostages were
unaware of the course negotiations were taking, but kept their
faith throughout, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Gurtner<e_enamex> said.
	   ``Hope was always there,'' he said. ``We were treated as
hostages. We were confined to a single room, <b_numex type="MEASURE">20 square meters<e_numex> (<b_numex type="MEASURE">200
square feet<e_numex>) for <b_numex type="CARDINAL">10<e_numex> of us. But we always had access to water, food
and sanitary facilities. Apart from a <b_timex type="DURATION">very few tense moments<e_timex>,
generally speaking, we've been treated with respect.''
	   He blamed an international TV crew, which he did not name, for
creating unnecessary tensions.
	   ``They forced their entrance into the compound and actually used
some of the militiamen, almost inciting them to create the most
dramatic affect,'' he said. ``There, I thought I was not going to
survive. The press has very seriously affected the dignity of all
us.''
	   The news of the release came after a <b_timex type="DURATION">night<e_timex> of anxiety and
last-minute bickering among the captors, he said.
	   ``The moment we came out of the room, when we saw colleagues
from the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION" alt="Red Crescent">Somali Red Crescent<e_enamex> who came to pick us up, and once I was
in the car and the car started moving, I burst out crying,''
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Gurtner<e_enamex> said. ``It was a total moment of relief.''
	   The freed hostages appeared in good shape and there were no
indications that they had been physically harmed.
	   In <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Mogadishu<e_enamex>, all <b_numex type="CARDINAL">three<e_numex> Somali faction leaders as well as clan
elders came to congratulate the group on the release.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Ali Mahdi Mohamed<e_enamex>, a Somali leader from north <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Mogadishu<e_enamex>,
apologized for their ordeal on behalf of Somalis.

pledging to combine efforts to prevent Russian organized crime from

<b_enamex type="PERSON">Carla del Ponte<e_enamex> and Russian Prosecutor General <b_enamex type="PERSON">Yuri Skuratov<e_enamex>, calls
for sharing information about organized crime suspects and about
banks involved in laundering or accepting deposits of illegal
profits.
	   There have been frequent reports that Russian organized crime
uses Swiss banks to launder criminal profits running to <b_numex type="MONEY">hundreds of
millions of dollars<e_numex>. The activity apparently thrives in the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Lake

prostitution rackets.
	   Last year, <b_enamex type="PERSON">del Ponte<e_enamex> and <b_enamex type="PERSON">Skuratov<e_enamex> agreed to step up efforts in
fighting organized crime, but the memorandum signed <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex> was the

	   ``I believe that we have made a very important step toward
raising a solid barrier against organized crime,'' <b_enamex type="PERSON">Skuratov<e_enamex> told
reporters after the signing.
	   Nobody knows exactly how much Russian crime money is being kept
in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Switzerland<e_enamex>, and figuring that out is <b_numex type="CARDINAL">one<e_numex> of the goals of the
new agreement, <b_enamex type="PERSON">del Ponte<e_enamex> and <b_enamex type="PERSON">Skuratov<e_enamex> said at a joint news
conference.
	   ``If I knew that, I would be a very happy lawyer,'' <b_enamex type="PERSON">del Ponte<e_enamex>
told reporters.
	   ``<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Switzerland<e_enamex> is above all interested in getting <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Russia<e_enamex>'s
information on people suspected in laundering money in
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Switzerland<e_enamex>,'' <b_enamex type="PERSON">del Ponte<e_enamex> said.
	   The sides also agreed to form a joint task force to investigate
organized crime activities, share information and analyze the crime
situation in the <b_numex type="CARDINAL">two<e_numex> countries, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Skuratov<e_enamex> said.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Del Ponte<e_enamex> also said that Swiss police has completed the

bosses, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Sergei Mikhailov<e_enamex>, who was arrested in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Geneva<e_enamex> in <b_timex type="DATE">October,

	   IN ANY MEDIA WITHOUT ATTRIBUTION TO <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">WORLDSOURCES, INC.<e_enamex>
	   THE Companies Act <b_timex type="DATE">1965<e_timex> needs to be amended to check against the
unhealthy activities of non-governmental organisations operating
under the disguise of companies.
	   Deputy Minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs <b_enamex type="PERSON">Datuk S.
	   Subramaniam<e_enamex> told the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Dewan Rakyat<e_enamex> that some of these NGOs were
found to be carrying out activities not in the interest of the
public or national security.
	   Tabling the Companies (Amendment) (No.2) Bill <b_timex type="DATE">1997<e_timex> for a second
reading, he said a new section had been proposed to empower the
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Registrar of Companies<e_enamex> to refuse registration of the memorandum of
a proposed company if he was satisfied that it was likely to be
used for unlawful purposes, or any purpose prejudicial to or
incompatible with peace, welfare, security, public order, good
order or morality, or prejudicial to national security or public
interest.
	   The amendments also seek to provide additional grounds for the
courts to compulsorily wind up a company if it is being used as
specified above.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Subramaniam<e_enamex> said the amendments were also aimed at ensuring
companies would be more responsible in matters pertaining to their
accounts.
	   As the accounts have to be made out in accordance with approved
accounting standards with certain exceptions, they would be able to
reflect the real performance of the companies.
	   During the debate, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Datuk Abu Zahar Ujang<e_enamex> (<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">BN<e_enamex>-<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Kuala Pilah<e_enamex>) felt
suitable measures must be introduced to help companies facing
problems due to economic uncertainties.
	   He proposed that creditors and management of companies find an
amicable solution to overcome their financial difficulties.
	   He said the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">ROC<e_enamex> needed to improve its services and
administration, and <b_numex type="CARDINAL">one<e_numex> way this could be achieved was through its
corporatisation.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Lim Kit Siang<e_enamex> (<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">DAP<e_enamex>-<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Tanjung<e_enamex>) focused his debate on <b_numex type="CARDINAL">one<e_numex> of his
favourite topics - questioning the Government on its move to bail
out companies now in difficulties due to economic problems.
	   Reiterating his stand that the various corporate exercises
involving companies like <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Malaysia Airlines<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Renong<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Konsortium
Perkapalan<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">United Engineers Malaysia<e_enamex> and others were actually
attempts to rescue companies which had connections with the
Government, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Lim<e_enamex> proposed that a commission be established to handle
the task.
	   ``If bailing-out is to become a government policy, set up this
commission where everyone can submit their applications for them to
be vetted fairly, regardless of whether they are big or small
companies, with or without connections.''
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Lim<e_enamex> also questioned <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Ekran Bhd<e_enamex>'s move in using proceeds from a
rights issue although it differed from the original intended
purpose, saying the case would be a test to the performance of the
regulatory authorities.
	   The <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Opposition<e_enamex> leader said he did not object to the amendments
but hoped the additional powers would not be used to silence NGOs
from criticising government policies or actions.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Husni Hanadzlah<e_enamex> (<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">BN<e_enamex>-<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Tambun<e_enamex>) hoped the proposed amendments would
enhance the responsibility of the board of directors towards
shareholders and ensure non-abuse of power.
	   On audit committees, the MP said a study should be conducted to
ensure all public companies adhered to the regulation to hold audit
committee meetings <b_numex type="MEASURE">four times a year<e_numex>. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Husni<e_enamex> said the amendment
would also ensure the authenticity of documents filed or lodged by
the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Registrar<e_enamex>.
	   He praised the move to enable documents required under the Act
to be electronically filed or lodged with the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Registrar<e_enamex> but said
the information provided must not be outdated.
	   In lauding the proposed amendments, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Michael Lisa Kaya<e_enamex> (<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">BN<e_enamex>-<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Bukit
Mas<e_enamex>) said the proposed inclusion of Section 11(a) was a good move
in keeping abreast of national development and the Government's
aspirations in information technology.
	   The proposed amendment would see the insertion of this section
for electronic filing of documents. The <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Registrar<e_enamex> may provide a
service for the electronic filing or lodging of documents.
	   The MP said NGOs would be prevented from misleading the public
and causing disharmony with the introduction of the amendment.
	   Citing <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Sahabat Alam Malaysia<e_enamex> as an example, the MP questioned
its motives in playing a role in the setting up of human blockades
in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Sarawak<e_enamex> in <b_timex type="DATE">1991<e_timex>.
	   ``Instead of inciting the natives, why don't they just educate
them by holding seminars,'' he asked.
	   For more than <b_timex type="DURATION">two weeks<e_timex>, he added, the people suffered by
participating in the blockades instead of cultivating their land.
	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Mentakab<e_enamex> MP <b_enamex type="PERSON">Fu Ah Kiow<e_enamex> also supported the proposed amendment to
introduce electronic filing and said this would help in
streamlining the efficiency of the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">ROC<e_enamex>'s documentation process.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">M. Kulasegaran<e_enamex> (<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">DAP<e_enamex>-<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Teluk Intan<e_enamex>) raised the issue of golf clubs
which offered transferable memberships, citing the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Kelab Golf Darul
Ridzuan<e_enamex> in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Perak<e_enamex> as an example. He said the club, formerly known as
the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Meru Valley Golf Club<e_enamex>, had also offered lots priced at between
<b_numex type="MONEY">RM120,000<e_numex> and <b_numex type="MONEY">RM150,000<e_numex> each.
	   Local members were charged monthly fees while it was waived for
international members.
	   He urged the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">ROC<e_enamex> to conduct stringent inspections over such
clubs nationwide.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Subramaniam<e_enamex> will wind-up the debate on <b_timex type="DATE">Wednesday<e_timex>.

the <b_numex type="CARDINAL">235,000<e_numex> low-cost houses targeted by the Government under the
Seventh Malaysia Plan had been built by the various States, the
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">House<e_enamex> was told yesterday.
	   Deputy Minister of <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION" status="opt">Housing and Local Government<e_enamex> <b_enamex type="PERSON">Peter Chin Fah

	   The setting up of the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">National Housing Corporation<e_enamex>, he said,
would ensure the quality of houses and that developers were more

be responsible for building low-cost houses.

Workers reject wage package, set stage for general strike
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">COPENHAGEN<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Denmark<e_enamex> (<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">AP<e_enamex>) _ <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Denmark<e_enamex>'s largest industrial unions
have rejected a wage proposal, setting the stage for a nationwide
general strike, officials announced <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex>.
	   State mediator <b_enamex type="PERSON">Asbjoern Jensen<e_enamex> announced that <b_numex type="PERCENT">56 percent<e_numex> of
those voting on the proposal turned it down. The rejection means a
general strike is likely to begin on <b_timex type="DATE">Monday<e_timex>, barring last-minute
government intervention that could stave it off.
	   Prime Minister <b_enamex type="PERSON">Poul Nyrup Rasmussen<e_enamex> rejected media speculation
that a strike would force the postponement of the <b_timex type="DATE">May 28<e_timex> referendum
on the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">European Union<e_enamex>'s <b_enamex type="LOCATION" status="opt">Amsterdam<e_enamex> treaty.
	   A postponement had been widely expected in case of a strike.
Many observers believed the government would not risk placing the
treaty before <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Denmark<e_enamex>'s voters _ who are perpetually uneasy with
the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">EU<e_enamex> _ during a period of disorder.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Nyrup Rasmussen<e_enamex> also said the government would not intervene in
a strike.
	   If a strike includes workers who stay off the job in sympathy
with the unions who rejected the pact, an estimated <b_numex type="CARDINAL">400,000<e_numex> people
could be involved. That could bring the country to a virtual halt.
	   A general strike would quickly ramify throughout <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Europe<e_enamex>.
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Copenhagen<e_enamex> is the main air transport hub for the Nordic region and
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Denmark<e_enamex> is the primary route for Norwegian and Swedish exports to
reach the rest of <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Europe<e_enamex>.
	   ``The strike came out of the blue,'' said <b_enamex type="PERSON">Ask Hamstrup<e_enamex>, an
office clerk heading into a supermarket. ``This means that we have
to hamster,'' he said, referring to the rodents' practice of
storing food in their cheeks.
	   The <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Central Organization of Industrial Employees<e_enamex> members'
rejection of the <b_timex type="DURATION">two-year<e_timex> wage pact came as a surprise. Most
observers had expected the unions would approve the compromise
agreement worked out in <b_timex type="DATE">March<e_timex> with the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Confederation of Danish
Industries<e_enamex>.
	   The package included an extra paid day off, pension
contributions increasing by <b_numex type="MEASURE">0.9 percent per year<e_numex> and the minimum
wage would increase by <b_numex type="MONEY">2 kroner<e_numex> (<b_numex type="MONEY">28 cents<e_numex>) over the next <b_timex type="DURATION">two years<e_timex>.
The minimum wage is <b_numex type="MEASURE">76.40 kroner (dlrs 10.6) an hour<e_numex>.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">UNITED NATIONS<e_enamex> (<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">AP<e_enamex>) _ <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">U.N. Security Council<e_enamex> members said <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex>
the international community must demonstrate the political will to
help <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Africa<e_enamex> overcome its economic and social problems.
	   The calls came during an <b_timex type="DURATION">all-day<e_timex> debate on <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Africa<e_enamex> to review
Secretary-General <b_enamex type="PERSON">Kofi Annan<e_enamex>'s report last week, in which he
outlined goals for the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">United Nations<e_enamex> in assisting the world's most
under-developed continent.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Annan<e_enamex>, the first sub-Saharan African to head the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">United Nations<e_enamex>,
said that African leaders must be willing to combat corruption,
protect human rights and pursue sound economic policies.
	   At the same time, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Annan<e_enamex> said, the international community must
respond by investing in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Africa<e_enamex> and by intervening to end armed
conflicts and restore stability.
	   Echoing <b_enamex type="PERSON">Annan<e_enamex>'s comments, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Portugal<e_enamex>'s <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">U.N.<e_enamex> ambassador, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Antonio
Monteiro<e_enamex>, said ``political will is needed from the international
community'' to help <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Africa<e_enamex> overcome its political problems.
	   ``And will and courage is very much needed to avoid future
situations in which the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">United Nations<e_enamex> is unfortunately seen to
have turned its back on the African people,'' <b_enamex type="PERSON">Monteiro<e_enamex> said.
``Concrete measures should be considered to ensure that the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">United
Nations<e_enamex> and the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Security Council<e_enamex> in particular provide a timely
response to impending crises.''
	   But the council's willingness to intervene in African crises was
weakened by the disastrous failure of the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">U.N.<e_enamex> peacekeeping
operation in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Somalia<e_enamex>.
	   The deaths of <b_numex type="CARDINAL">18<e_numex> American soldiers in a gun battle in <b_timex type="DATE">1993<e_timex> led
the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">United States<e_enamex> to withdraw from the Somali operation and impose
stringent conditions on future <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">U.N.<e_enamex> peacekeeping missions.
	   <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">U.N.<e_enamex> officials have complained those conditions have made it
nearly impossible for the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">United Nations<e_enamex> to respond quickly to
African crises. They point to the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">U.S.<e_enamex> stand as a major reason for
the laggard <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">U.N.<e_enamex> response to the <b_timex type="DATE">1994<e_timex> massacre of up to <b_numex type="CARDINAL">500,000<e_numex>
Rwandan Tutsis and moderate Hutus by Hutu extremists.
	   ``The experience of intervention in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Somalia<e_enamex> was a bitter one but
that of non-intervention in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Rwanda<e_enamex> was perhaps worse,'' British
Ambassador <b_enamex type="PERSON">John Weston<e_enamex> told the council.
	   He cited the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">U.N.<e_enamex> success in supervising the transition of
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Eastern Slavonia<e_enamex> from Serb to Croat control as an example of how
the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">United Nations<e_enamex> could be effective ``given the right mandates
and resources.''
	   The <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Security Council<e_enamex> asked <b_enamex type="PERSON">Annan<e_enamex> to prepare the report following
a meeting on <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Africa<e_enamex> held in <b_timex type="DATE">September<e_timex>.
	   On <b_timex type="DATE">Wednesday<e_timex>, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Annan<e_enamex> begins a tour of <b_numex type="CARDINAL">eight<e_numex> African countries _
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Ethiopia<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Djibouti<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Kenya<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Tanzania<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Rwanda<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Burundi<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Uganda<e_enamex> and

<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Siberia<e_enamex> campaign plagued by dirty tricks; campaign papers seized
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">KRASNOYARSK<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Russia<e_enamex> (<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">AP<e_enamex>) _ The candidates for governor of the
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Krasnoyarsk<e_enamex> region of <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Siberia<e_enamex> have employed all the tools available
to modern politics: polling, television advertising _ and,
apparently, dirty tricks.
	   The election, set for <b_timex type="DATE">Sunday<e_timex>, has attracted national attention
because <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Russia<e_enamex>'s former security chief <b_enamex type="PERSON">Alexander Lebed<e_enamex> is <b_numex type="CARDINAL">one<e_numex> of
the candidates.
	   Russian news agencies reported <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex> that police had
confiscated <b_numex type="CARDINAL">850,000<e_numex> copies of a newspaper published by <b_enamex type="PERSON">Lebed<e_enamex>'s
campaign because it allegedly contained libelous material about his
chief rival, incumbent Gov. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Valery Zubov<e_enamex>.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Lebed<e_enamex> called the charge ``absurd,'' and said unspecified rivals
had been carrying out dirty tricks against his campaign, including
having someone hand out condoms to young schoolchildren in <b_enamex type="PERSON">Lebed<e_enamex>'s
name.
	   The <b_enamex type="PERSON">Lebed<e_enamex> newspaper, <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Krasnoyarski Krai<e_enamex>, was confiscated on
<b_timex type="DATE">Wednesday<e_timex> from a printing plant, authorities said. Local television
showed copies of the newspaper and the offending article, headlined
``Look out, Provocation!''
	   The article declared that <b_enamex type="PERSON">Zubov<e_enamex> was considering acts of
vandalism, including ``accidents at the power stations, the cutting
off of electricity, water, transportation, communications ... to
provoke dissatisfaction of the populace and to cause panic.''
	   A <b_enamex type="PERSON">Zubov<e_enamex> campaign spokesman, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Yuri Vasliev<e_enamex>, declined to comment on
the article <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex>, except to say that the matter needed to be
settled in court.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Lebed<e_enamex>, in an interview with <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">The Associated Press<e_enamex>, denied any
knowledge of the article and said there had been no justification
for seizing the newspapers.
	   ``I think it is the activity of the governor,'' he said. He went
on to say that there had been numerous dirty tricks played on his
campaign.
	   ``I am categorically against these dirty tricks,'' he said. ``I
am eager to increase positive things.''

Blast kills <b_numex type="CARDINAL">six<e_numex> in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Nigeria<e_enamex>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">LAGOS<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Nigeria<e_enamex> (<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">AP<e_enamex>) _ An explosion has rocked the southwestern
university town of <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Ife<e_enamex> killing at least <b_numex type="CARDINAL">six<e_numex> people, <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Radio Lagos<e_enamex>
reported <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex>.
	   Initial reports said the explosion late <b_timex type="DATE">Thursday<e_timex> night had
occurred in the nearby city of <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Ilesha<e_enamex>, about <b_numex type="MEASURE">200 kilometers<e_numex> (<b_numex type="MEASURE">125
miles<e_numex>) northeast of the commercial capital <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Lagos<e_enamex>.
	   Several other people were wounded.
	   The cause of the blast was not given, but the radio report said
it was similar to an explosion <b_timex type="DURATION">one night<e_timex> earlier that killed <b_numex type="CARDINAL">three<e_numex>
people in a <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Lagos<e_enamex> suburb.
	   The town's military governor on <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex> inspected the site of the
explosion in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Ife<e_enamex>, but few details were made public.
	   Authorities have not said whether either explosion was caused by
a bomb, but church leaders and opponents of <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Nigeria<e_enamex>'s ruling
military junta have warned of violence if the army does not step
down from power.
	   <b_timex type="DATE">Thursday<e_timex>'s blast came just days before nationwide voting in
legislative elections _ part of a transition process from military
to civilian rule in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Nigeria<e_enamex>.
	   Opponents have called the transition a sham and have vowed to
boycott voting in <b_timex type="DATE">Saturday<e_timex>'s legislative polls and in presidential
elections later this year.
	   Bomb experts in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Lagos<e_enamex>, meanwhile, were sifting through debris
from a blast <b_timex type="DATE">Wednesday<e_timex> night that left a huge crater in a
residential street.
	   Victims in that explosion were outside watching a soccer match
on a television that had been placed in a neighbor's yard when the
explosion occurred.
	   Hours earlier, a senior Roman Catholic leader warned of violence
in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Nigeria<e_enamex> if military ruler Gen. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Sani Abacha<e_enamex> becomes president
later this year.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Abacha<e_enamex>, a devout Muslim, has very little support in the
country's south, where Christians say they face discrimination and
repression from the military junta.
	   Opposition and pro-democracy groups are outraged at the recent
unanimous presidential nominations of <b_enamex type="PERSON">Abacha<e_enamex> by <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Nigeria<e_enamex>'s <b_numex type="CARDINAL">five<e_numex>
political parties. Most of his opponents have said the nomination
process was rigged to eliminate any competition.
	   Presidential elections will now take the form of a referendum to
vote for or against <b_enamex type="PERSON">Abacha<e_enamex>'s uncontested nomination.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Abacha<e_enamex> seized power in a bloodless <b_timex type="DATE">1993<e_timex> coup and has since faced
international criticizing for rampant human rights abuses and
refusing to hand power over to a civilian government.
