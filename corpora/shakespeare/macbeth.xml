</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE II.  A camp near Forres.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Alarum within. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM, DONALBAIN,
LENNOX, with Attendants, meeting a bleeding Sergeant</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUNCAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What bloody man is that? He can report,</LINE>
<LINE>As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt</LINE>
<LINE>The newest state.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MALCOLM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is the sergeant</LINE>
<LINE>Who like a good and hardy soldier fought</LINE>
<LINE>'Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend!</LINE>
<LINE>Say to the king the knowledge of the broil</LINE>
<LINE>As thou didst leave it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Sergeant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Doubtful it stood;</LINE>
<LINE>As two spent swimmers, that do cling together</LINE>
<LINE>And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald--</LINE>
<LINE>Worthy to be a rebel, for to that</LINE>
<LINE>The multiplying villanies of nature</LINE>
<LINE>Do swarm upon him--from the western isles</LINE>
<LINE>Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;</LINE>
<LINE>And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,</LINE>
<LINE>Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:</LINE>
<LINE>For brave Macbeth--well he deserves that name--</LINE>
<LINE>Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,</LINE>
<LINE>Which smoked with bloody execution,</LINE>
<LINE>Like valour's minion carved out his passage</LINE>
<LINE>Till he faced the slave;</LINE>
<LINE>Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,</LINE>
<LINE>Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,</LINE>
<LINE>And fix'd his head upon our battlements.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUNCAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Sergeant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As whence the sun 'gins his reflection</LINE>
<LINE>Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break,</LINE>
<LINE>So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come</LINE>
<LINE>Discomfort swells. Mark, king of Scotland, mark:</LINE>
<LINE>No sooner justice had with valour arm'd</LINE>
<LINE>Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,</LINE>
<LINE>But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage,</LINE>
<LINE>With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men</LINE>
<LINE>Began a fresh assault.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUNCAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dismay'd not this</LINE>
<LINE>Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Sergeant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes;</LINE>
<LINE>As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.</LINE>
<LINE>If I say sooth, I must report they were</LINE>
<LINE>As cannons overcharged with double cracks, so they</LINE>
<LINE>Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:</LINE>
<LINE>Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,</LINE>
<LINE>Or memorise another Golgotha,</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot tell.</LINE>
<LINE>But I am faint, my gashes cry for help.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUNCAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So well thy words become thee as thy wounds;</LINE>
<LINE>They smack of honour both. Go get him surgeons.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Sergeant, attended</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Who comes here?</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter ROSS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MALCOLM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The worthy thane of Ross.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LENNOX</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look</LINE>
<LINE>That seems to speak things strange.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God save the king!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUNCAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Whence camest thou, worthy thane?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>From Fife, great king;</LINE>
<LINE>Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky</LINE>
<LINE>And fan our people cold. Norway himself,</LINE>
<LINE>With terrible numbers,</LINE>
<LINE>Assisted by that most disloyal traitor</LINE>
<LINE>The thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;</LINE>
<LINE>Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,</LINE>
<LINE>Confronted him with self-comparisons,</LINE>
<LINE>Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm.</LINE>
<LINE>Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,</LINE>
<LINE>The victory fell on us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUNCAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Great happiness!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That now</LINE>
<LINE>Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition:</LINE>
<LINE>Nor would we deign him burial of his men</LINE>
<LINE>Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's inch</LINE>
<LINE>Ten thousand dollars to our general use.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUNCAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive</LINE>
<LINE>Our bosom interest: go pronounce his present death,</LINE>
<LINE>And with his former title greet Macbeth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll see it done.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Thunder. Enter the three Witches</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Witch</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where hast thou been, sister?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Witch</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Killing swine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Witch</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sister, where thou?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Witch</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap,</LINE>
<LINE>And munch'd, and munch'd, and munch'd:--</LINE>
<LINE>'Give me,' quoth I:</LINE>
<LINE>'Aroint thee, witch!' the rump-fed ronyon cries.</LINE>
<LINE>Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the Tiger:</LINE>
<LINE>But in a sieve I'll thither sail,</LINE>
<LINE>And, like a rat without a tail,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Witch</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll give thee a wind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Witch</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou'rt kind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Witch</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I another.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Witch</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I myself have all the other,</LINE>
<LINE>And the very ports they blow,</LINE>
<LINE>All the quarters that they know</LINE>
<LINE>I' the shipman's card.</LINE>
<LINE>I will drain him dry as hay:</LINE>
<LINE>Sleep shall neither night nor day</LINE>
<LINE>Hang upon his pent-house lid;</LINE>
<LINE>He shall live a man forbid:</LINE>
<LINE>Weary se'nnights nine times nine</LINE>
<LINE>Shall he dwindle, peak and pine:</LINE>
<LINE>Though his bark cannot be lost,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet it shall be tempest-tost.</LINE>
<LINE>Look what I have.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Witch</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Show me, show me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Witch</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here I have a pilot's thumb,</LINE>
<LINE>Wreck'd as homeward he did come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Drum within</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Witch</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A drum, a drum!</LINE>
<LINE>Macbeth doth come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The weird sisters, hand in hand,</LINE>
<LINE>Posters of the sea and land,</LINE>
<LINE>Thus do go about, about:</LINE>
<LINE>Thrice to thine and thrice to mine</LINE>
<LINE>And thrice again, to make up nine.</LINE>
<LINE>Peace! the charm's wound up.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter MACBETH and BANQUO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So foul and fair a day I have not seen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BANQUO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How far is't call'd to Forres? What are these</LINE>
<LINE>So wither'd and so wild in their attire,</LINE>
<LINE>That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught</LINE>
<LINE>That man may question? You seem to understand me,</LINE>
<LINE>By each at once her chappy finger laying</LINE>
<LINE>Upon her skinny lips: you should be women,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet your beards forbid me to interpret</LINE>
<LINE>That you are so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Speak, if you can: what are you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Witch</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, thane of Glamis!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Witch</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, thane of Cawdor!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Witch</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All hail, Macbeth, thou shalt be king hereafter!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BANQUO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good sir, why do you start; and seem to fear</LINE>
<LINE>Things that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth,</LINE>
<LINE>Are ye fantastical, or that indeed</LINE>
<LINE>Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner</LINE>
<LINE>You greet with present grace and great prediction</LINE>
<LINE>Of noble having and of royal hope,</LINE>
<LINE>That he seems rapt withal: to me you speak not.</LINE>
<LINE>If you can look into the seeds of time,</LINE>
<LINE>And say which grain will grow and which will not,</LINE>
<LINE>Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear</LINE>
<LINE>Your favours nor your hate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Witch</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hail!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Witch</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hail!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Witch</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hail!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Witch</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Witch</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not so happy, yet much happier.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Witch</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none:</LINE>
<LINE>So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Witch</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:</LINE>
<LINE>By Sinel's death I know I am thane of Glamis;</LINE>
<LINE>But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives,</LINE>
<LINE>A prosperous gentleman; and to be king</LINE>
<LINE>Stands not within the prospect of belief,</LINE>
<LINE>No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence</LINE>
<LINE>You owe this strange intelligence? or why</LINE>
<LINE>Upon this blasted heath you stop our way</LINE>
<LINE>With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Witches vanish</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BANQUO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,</LINE>
<LINE>And these are of them. Whither are they vanish'd?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Into the air; and what seem'd corporal melted</LINE>
<LINE>As breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BANQUO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Were such things here as we do speak about?</LINE>
<LINE>Or have we eaten on the insane root</LINE>
<LINE>That takes the reason prisoner?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your children shall be kings.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BANQUO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You shall be king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BANQUO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To the selfsame tune and words. Who's here?</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter ROSS and ANGUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The king hath happily received, Macbeth,</LINE>
<LINE>The news of thy success; and when he reads</LINE>
<LINE>Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight,</LINE>
<LINE>His wonders and his praises do contend</LINE>
<LINE>Which should be thine or his: silenced with that,</LINE>
<LINE>In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day,</LINE>
<LINE>He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,</LINE>
<LINE>Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,</LINE>
<LINE>Strange images of death. As thick as hail</LINE>
<LINE>Came post with post; and every one did bear</LINE>
<LINE>Thy praises in his kingdom's great defence,</LINE>
<LINE>And pour'd them down before him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANGUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We are sent</LINE>
<LINE>To give thee from our royal master thanks;</LINE>
<LINE>Only to herald thee into his sight,</LINE>
<LINE>Not pay thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And, for an earnest of a greater honour,</LINE>
<LINE>He bade me, from him, call thee thane of Cawdor:</LINE>
<LINE>In which addition, hail, most worthy thane!</LINE>
<LINE>For it is thine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BANQUO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, can the devil speak true?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me</LINE>
<LINE>In borrow'd robes?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANGUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who was the thane lives yet;</LINE>
<LINE>But under heavy judgment bears that life</LINE>
<LINE>Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combined</LINE>
<LINE>With those of Norway, or did line the rebel</LINE>
<LINE>With hidden help and vantage, or that with both</LINE>
<LINE>He labour'd in his country's wreck, I know not;</LINE>
<LINE>But treasons capital, confess'd and proved,</LINE>
<LINE>Have overthrown him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  Glamis, and thane of Cawdor!</LINE>
<LINE>The greatest is behind.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To ROSS and ANGUS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Thanks for your pains.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To BANQUO</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Do you not hope your children shall be kings,</LINE>
<LINE>When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me</LINE>
<LINE>Promised no less to them?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BANQUO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That trusted home</LINE>
<LINE>Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,</LINE>
<LINE>Besides the thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:</LINE>
<LINE>And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,</LINE>
<LINE>The instruments of darkness tell us truths,</LINE>
<LINE>Win us with honest trifles, to betray's</LINE>
<LINE>In deepest consequence.</LINE>
<LINE>Cousins, a word, I pray you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR> Two truths are told,</LINE>
<LINE>As happy prologues to the swelling act</LINE>
<LINE>Of the imperial theme.--I thank you, gentlemen.</LINE>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  This supernatural soliciting</LINE>
<LINE>Cannot be ill, cannot be good: if ill,</LINE>
<LINE>Why hath it given me earnest of success,</LINE>
<LINE>Commencing in a truth? I am thane of Cawdor:</LINE>
<LINE>If good, why do I yield to that suggestion</LINE>
<LINE>Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair</LINE>
<LINE>And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,</LINE>
<LINE>Against the use of nature? Present fears</LINE>
<LINE>Are less than horrible imaginings:</LINE>
<LINE>My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,</LINE>
<LINE>Shakes so my single state of man that function</LINE>
<LINE>Is smother'd in surmise, and nothing is</LINE>
<LINE>But what is not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BANQUO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Look, how our partner's rapt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me,</LINE>
<LINE>Without my stir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BANQUO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>New horrors come upon him,</LINE>
<LINE>Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould</LINE>
<LINE>But with the aid of use.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>                Come what come may,</LINE>
<LINE>Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BANQUO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me your favour: my dull brain was wrought</LINE>
<LINE>With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains</LINE>
<LINE>Are register'd where every day I turn</LINE>
<LINE>The leaf to read them. Let us toward the king.</LINE>
<LINE>Think upon what hath chanced, and, at more time,</LINE>
<LINE>The interim having weigh'd it, let us speak</LINE>
<LINE>Our free hearts each to other.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BANQUO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Very gladly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Till then, enough. Come, friends.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE IV.  Forres. The palace.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Flourish. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM, DONALBAIN, LENNOX,
and Attendants</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUNCAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not</LINE>
<LINE>Those in commission yet return'd?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MALCOLM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My liege,</LINE>
<LINE>They are not yet come back. But I have spoke</LINE>
<LINE>With one that saw him die: who did report</LINE>
<LINE>That very frankly he confess'd his treasons,</LINE>
<LINE>Implored your highness' pardon and set forth</LINE>
<LINE>A deep repentance: nothing in his life</LINE>
<LINE>Became him like the leaving it; he died</LINE>
<LINE>As one that had been studied in his death</LINE>
<LINE>To throw away the dearest thing he owed,</LINE>
<LINE>As 'twere a careless trifle.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUNCAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There's no art</LINE>
<LINE>To find the mind's construction in the face:</LINE>
<LINE>He was a gentleman on whom I built</LINE>
<LINE>An absolute trust.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter MACBETH, BANQUO, ROSS, and ANGUS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>O worthiest cousin!</LINE>
<LINE>The sin of my ingratitude even now</LINE>
<LINE>Was heavy on me: thou art so far before</LINE>
<LINE>That swiftest wing of recompense is slow</LINE>
<LINE>To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved,</LINE>
<LINE>That the proportion both of thanks and payment</LINE>
<LINE>Might have been mine! only I have left to say,</LINE>
<LINE>More is thy due than more than all can pay.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The service and the loyalty I owe,</LINE>
<LINE>In doing it, pays itself. Your highness' part</LINE>
<LINE>Is to receive our duties; and our duties</LINE>
<LINE>Are to your throne and state children and servants,</LINE>
<LINE>Which do but what they should, by doing every thing</LINE>
<LINE>Safe toward your love and honour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUNCAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Welcome hither:</LINE>
<LINE>I have begun to plant thee, and will labour</LINE>

<LINE>And you whose places are the nearest, know</LINE>
<LINE>We will establish our estate upon</LINE>
<LINE>Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter</LINE>
<LINE>The Prince of Cumberland; which honour must</LINE>
<LINE>Not unaccompanied invest him only,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'They met me in the day of success: and I have</LINE>
<LINE>learned by the perfectest report, they have more in</LINE>
<LINE>them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire</LINE>
<LINE>to question them further, they made themselves air,</LINE>
<LINE>into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in</LINE>
<LINE>the wonder of it, came missives from the king, who</LINE>
<LINE>all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor;' by which title,</LINE>
<LINE>before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred</LINE>
<LINE>me to the coming on of time, with 'Hail, king that</LINE>
<LINE>shalt be!' This have I thought good to deliver</LINE>
<LINE>thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou</LINE>
<LINE>mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being</LINE>
<LINE>ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it</LINE>
<LINE>to thy heart, and farewell.'</LINE>
<LINE>Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be</LINE>
<LINE>What thou art promised: yet do I fear thy nature;</LINE>
<LINE>It is too full o' the milk of human kindness</LINE>
<LINE>To catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great;</LINE>
<LINE>Art not without ambition, but without</LINE>
<LINE>The illness should attend it: what thou wouldst highly,</LINE>
<LINE>That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet wouldst wrongly win: thou'ldst have, great Glamis,</LINE>
<LINE>That which cries 'Thus thou must do, if thou have it;</LINE>
<LINE>And that which rather thou dost fear to do</LINE>
<LINE>Than wishest should be undone.' Hie thee hither,</LINE>
<LINE>That I may pour my spirits in thine ear;</LINE>
<LINE>And chastise with the valour of my tongue</LINE>
<LINE>All that impedes thee from the golden round,</LINE>
<LINE>Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem</LINE>
<LINE>To have thee crown'd withal.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>

<LINE>He brings great news.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Messenger</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>The raven himself is hoarse</LINE>
<LINE>That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan</LINE>
<LINE>Under my battlements. Come, you spirits</LINE>
<LINE>That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,</LINE>
<LINE>And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full</LINE>
<LINE>Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood;</LINE>
<LINE>Stop up the access and passage to remorse,</LINE>
<LINE>That no compunctious visitings of nature</LINE>
<LINE>Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between</LINE>
<LINE>The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,</LINE>
<LINE>And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,</LINE>
<LINE>Wherever in your sightless substances</LINE>
<LINE>You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,</LINE>
<LINE>And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,</LINE>
<LINE>That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,</LINE>
<LINE>To cry 'Hold, hold!'</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter MACBETH</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Great Glamis! worthy Cawdor!</LINE>

<LINE>Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,</LINE>
<LINE>Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower,</LINE>

<LINE>If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well</LINE>
<LINE>It were done quickly: if the assassination</LINE>
<LINE>Could trammel up the consequence, and catch</LINE>
<LINE>With his surcease success; that but this blow</LINE>
<LINE>Might be the be-all and the end-all here,</LINE>
<LINE>But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,</LINE>
<LINE>We'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases</LINE>
<LINE>We still have judgment here; that we but teach</LINE>
<LINE>Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return</LINE>
<LINE>To plague the inventor: this even-handed justice</LINE>
<LINE>Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice</LINE>
<LINE>To our own lips. He's here in double trust;</LINE>
<LINE>First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,</LINE>
<LINE>Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,</LINE>
<LINE>Who should against his murderer shut the door,</LINE>
<LINE>Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan</LINE>
<LINE>Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been</LINE>
<LINE>So clear in his great office, that his virtues</LINE>
<LINE>Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against</LINE>
<LINE>The deep damnation of his taking-off;</LINE>
<LINE>And pity, like a naked new-born babe,</LINE>
<LINE>Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, horsed</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the sightless couriers of the air,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,</LINE>
<LINE>That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur</LINE>
<LINE>To prick the sides of my intent, but only</LINE>
<LINE>Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Know you not he has?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We will proceed no further in this business:</LINE>
<LINE>He hath honour'd me of late; and I have bought</LINE>
<LINE>Golden opinions from all sorts of people,</LINE>
<LINE>Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,</LINE>
<LINE>Not cast aside so soon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Was the hope drunk</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein you dress'd yourself? hath it slept since?</LINE>
<LINE>And wakes it now, to look so green and pale</LINE>
<LINE>At what it did so freely? From this time</LINE>
<LINE>Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard</LINE>
<LINE>To be the same in thine own act and valour</LINE>
<LINE>As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that</LINE>
<LINE>Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life,</LINE>
<LINE>And live a coward in thine own esteem,</LINE>
<LINE>Letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would,'</LINE>
<LINE>Like the poor cat i' the adage?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Prithee, peace:</LINE>
<LINE>I dare do all that may become a man;</LINE>
<LINE>Who dares do more is none.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What beast was't, then,</LINE>
<LINE>That made you break this enterprise to me?</LINE>
<LINE>When you durst do it, then you were a man;</LINE>
<LINE>And, to be more than what you were, you would</LINE>
<LINE>Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place</LINE>
<LINE>Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:</LINE>
<LINE>They have made themselves, and that their fitness now</LINE>
<LINE>Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know</LINE>
<LINE>How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me:</LINE>
<LINE>I would, while it was smiling in my face,</LINE>
<LINE>Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,</LINE>
<LINE>And dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as you</LINE>
<LINE>Have done to this.</LINE>

<LINE>We fail!</LINE>
<LINE>But screw your courage to the sticking-place,</LINE>
<LINE>And we'll not fail. When Duncan is asleep--</LINE>
<LINE>Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey</LINE>
<LINE>Soundly invite him--his two chamberlains</LINE>
<LINE>Will I with wine and wassail so convince</LINE>
<LINE>That memory, the warder of the brain,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason</LINE>
<LINE>A limbeck only: when in swinish sleep</LINE>
<LINE>Their drenched natures lie as in a death,</LINE>
<LINE>What cannot you and I perform upon</LINE>
<LINE>The unguarded Duncan? what not put upon</LINE>

<LINE>When we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two</LINE>
<LINE>Of his own chamber and used their very daggers,</LINE>
<LINE>That they have done't?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.</LINE>
<LINE>Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible</LINE>
<LINE>To feeling as to sight? or art thou but</LINE>
<LINE>A dagger of the mind, a false creation,</LINE>
<LINE>Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?</LINE>
<LINE>I see thee yet, in form as palpable</LINE>
<LINE>As this which now I draw.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going;</LINE>
<LINE>And such an instrument I was to use.</LINE>
<LINE>Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,</LINE>
<LINE>Or else worth all the rest; I see thee still,</LINE>
<LINE>And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,</LINE>
<LINE>Which was not so before. There's no such thing:</LINE>
<LINE>It is the bloody business which informs</LINE>
<LINE>Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one halfworld</LINE>
<LINE>Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse</LINE>

<LINE>There's one did laugh in's sleep, and one cried</LINE>
<LINE>'Murder!'</LINE>
<LINE>That they did wake each other: I stood and heard them:</LINE>
<LINE>But they did say their prayers, and address'd them</LINE>
<LINE>Again to sleep.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There are two lodged together.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>One cried 'God bless us!' and 'Amen' the other;</LINE>
<LINE>As they had seen me with these hangman's hands.</LINE>
<LINE>Listening their fear, I could not say 'Amen,'</LINE>
<LINE>When they did say 'God bless us!'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Consider it not so deeply.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But wherefore could not I pronounce 'Amen'?</LINE>
<LINE>I had most need of blessing, and 'Amen'</LINE>
<LINE>Stuck in my throat.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These deeds must not be thought</LINE>
<LINE>After these ways; so, it will make us mad.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Methought I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no more!</LINE>
<LINE>Macbeth does murder sleep', the innocent sleep,</LINE>
<LINE>Sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of care,</LINE>
<LINE>The death of each day's life, sore labour's bath,</LINE>
<LINE>Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,</LINE>
<LINE>Chief nourisher in life's feast,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What do you mean?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Still it cried 'Sleep no more!' to all the house:</LINE>
<LINE>'Glamis hath murder'd sleep, and therefore Cawdor</LINE>
<LINE>Shall sleep no more; Macbeth shall sleep no more.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,</LINE>
<LINE>You do unbend your noble strength, to think</LINE>
<LINE>So brainsickly of things. Go get some water,</LINE>
<LINE>And wash this filthy witness from your hand.</LINE>
<LINE>Why did you bring these daggers from the place?</LINE>
<LINE>They must lie there: go carry them; and smear</LINE>
<LINE>The sleepy grooms with blood.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll go no more:</LINE>
<LINE>I am afraid to think what I have done;</LINE>
<LINE>Look on't again I dare not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Infirm of purpose!</LINE>
<LINE>Give me the daggers: the sleeping and the dead</LINE>
<LINE>Are but as pictures: 'tis the eye of childhood</LINE>
<LINE>That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal;</LINE>
<LINE>For it must seem their guilt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exit. Knocking within</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Whence is that knocking?</LINE>
<LINE>How is't with me, when every noise appals me?</LINE>
<LINE>What hands are here? ha! they pluck out mine eyes.</LINE>
<LINE>Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood</LINE>
<LINE>Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather</LINE>
<LINE>The multitudinous seas in incarnadine,</LINE>
<LINE>Making the green one red.</LINE>

<LINE>I hear a knocking</LINE>
<LINE>At the south entry: retire we to our chamber;</LINE>
<LINE>A little water clears us of this deed:</LINE>

<LINE>Hath left you unattended.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Knocking within</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Hark! more knocking.</LINE>
<LINE>Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Knocking within. Enter a Porter</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Porter</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here's a knocking indeed! If a</LINE>
<LINE>man were porter of hell-gate, he should have</LINE>
<LINE>old turning the key.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Knocking within</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Knock,</LINE>
<LINE>knock, knock! Who's there, i' the name of</LINE>
<LINE>Beelzebub? Here's a farmer, that hanged</LINE>
<LINE>himself on the expectation of plenty: come in</LINE>
<LINE>time; have napkins enow about you; here</LINE>
<LINE>you'll sweat for't.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Knocking within</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Knock,</LINE>
<LINE>knock! Who's there, in the other devil's</LINE>
<LINE>name? Faith, here's an equivocator, that could</LINE>
<LINE>swear in both the scales against either scale;</LINE>
<LINE>who committed treason enough for God's sake,</LINE>
<LINE>yet could not equivocate to heaven: O, come</LINE>
<LINE>in, equivocator.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Knocking within</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Knock,</LINE>
<LINE>knock, knock! Who's there? Faith, here's an</LINE>
<LINE>English tailor come hither, for stealing out of</LINE>
<LINE>a French hose: come in, tailor; here you may</LINE>
<LINE>roast your goose.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Knocking within</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Knock,</LINE>
<LINE>knock; never at quiet! What are you? But</LINE>
<LINE>this place is too cold for hell. I'll devil-porter</LINE>
<LINE>it no further: I had thought to have let in</LINE>
<LINE>some of all professions that go the primrose</LINE>
<LINE>way to the everlasting bonfire.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Knocking within</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Anon, anon! I pray you, remember the porter.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACDUFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed,</LINE>
<LINE>That you do lie so late?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Porter</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Faith sir, we were carousing till the</LINE>
<LINE>second cock: and drink, sir, is a great</LINE>
<LINE>provoker of three things.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACDUFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What three things does drink especially provoke?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Porter</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and</LINE>
<LINE>urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes, and unprovokes;</LINE>
<LINE>it provokes the desire, but it takes</LINE>
<LINE>away the performance: therefore, much drink</LINE>
<LINE>may be said to be an equivocator with lechery:</LINE>
<LINE>it makes him, and it mars him; it sets</LINE>
<LINE>him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him,</LINE>
<LINE>and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and</LINE>
<LINE>not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him</LINE>
<LINE>in a sleep, and, giving him the lie, leaves him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACDUFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Porter</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That it did, sir, i' the very throat on</LINE>
<LINE>me: but I requited him for his lie; and, I</LINE>
<LINE>think, being too strong for him, though he took</LINE>
<LINE>up my legs sometime, yet I made a shift to cast</LINE>
<LINE>him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACDUFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is thy master stirring?</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter MACBETH</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LENNOX</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The night has been unruly: where we lay,</LINE>
<LINE>Our chimneys were blown down; and, as they say,</LINE>
<LINE>Lamentings heard i' the air; strange screams of death,</LINE>
<LINE>And prophesying with accents terrible</LINE>
<LINE>Of dire combustion and confused events</LINE>
<LINE>New hatch'd to the woeful time: the obscure bird</LINE>
<LINE>Clamour'd the livelong night: some say, the earth</LINE>
<LINE>Was feverous and did shake.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Twas a rough night.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACDUFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O gentle lady,</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak:</LINE>
<LINE>The repetition, in a woman's ear,</LINE>
<LINE>Would murder as it fell.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter BANQUO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Had I but died an hour before this chance,</LINE>
<LINE>I had lived a blessed time; for, from this instant,</LINE>
<LINE>There 's nothing serious in mortality:</LINE>
<LINE>All is but toys: renown and grace is dead;</LINE>
<LINE>The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees</LINE>
<LINE>Is left this vault to brag of.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DONALBAIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is amiss?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are, and do not know't:</LINE>
<LINE>The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood</LINE>
<LINE>Is stopp'd; the very source of it is stopp'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACDUFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your royal father 's murder'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MALCOLM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, by whom?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LENNOX</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Those of his chamber, as it seem'd, had done 't:</LINE>
<LINE>Their hands and faces were an badged with blood;</LINE>
<LINE>So were their daggers, which unwiped we found</LINE>
<LINE>Upon their pillows:</LINE>
<LINE>They stared, and were distracted; no man's life</LINE>
<LINE>Was to be trusted with them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, yet I do repent me of my fury,</LINE>
<LINE>That I did kill them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACDUFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wherefore did you so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious,</LINE>
<LINE>Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man:</LINE>
<LINE>The expedition my violent love</LINE>
<LINE>Outrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan,</LINE>
<LINE>His silver skin laced with his golden blood;</LINE>
<LINE>And his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature</LINE>
<LINE>For ruin's wasteful entrance: there, the murderers,</LINE>
<LINE>Steep'd in the colours of their trade, their daggers</LINE>
<LINE>Unmannerly breech'd with gore: who could refrain,</LINE>
<LINE>That had a heart to love, and in that heart</LINE>
<LINE>Courage to make 's love known?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Help me hence, ho!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MALCOLM</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>DONALBAIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside to MALCOLM</STAGEDIR>  What should be spoken here,</LINE>

<LINE>And when we have our naked frailties hid,</LINE>
<LINE>That suffer in exposure, let us meet,</LINE>
<LINE>And question this most bloody piece of work,</LINE>
<LINE>To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us:</LINE>
<LINE>In the great hand of God I stand; and thence</LINE>
<LINE>Against the undivulged pretence I fight</LINE>
<LINE>Of treasonous malice.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACDUFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so do I.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MALCOLM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What will you do? Let's not consort with them:</LINE>
<LINE>To show an unfelt sorrow is an office</LINE>
<LINE>Which the false man does easy. I'll to England.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DONALBAIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To Ireland, I; our separated fortune</LINE>
<LINE>Shall keep us both the safer: where we are,</LINE>
<LINE>There's daggers in men's smiles: the near in blood,</LINE>
<LINE>The nearer bloody.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MALCOLM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This murderous shaft that's shot</LINE>
<LINE>Hath not yet lighted, and our safest way</LINE>
<LINE>Is to avoid the aim. Therefore, to horse;</LINE>
<LINE>And let us not be dainty of leave-taking,</LINE>
<LINE>But shift away: there's warrant in that theft</LINE>
<LINE>Which steals itself, when there's no mercy left.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, good father,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou seest, the heavens, as troubled with man's act,</LINE>
<LINE>Threaten his bloody stage: by the clock, 'tis day,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp:</LINE>
<LINE>Is't night's predominance, or the day's shame,</LINE>
<LINE>That darkness does the face of earth entomb,</LINE>
<LINE>When living light should kiss it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Old Man</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis unnatural,</LINE>

<LINE>Here's our chief guest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If he had been forgotten,</LINE>
<LINE>It had been as a gap in our great feast,</LINE>
<LINE>And all-thing unbecoming.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To-night we hold a solemn supper sir,</LINE>
<LINE>And I'll request your presence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BANQUO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let your highness</LINE>
<LINE>Command upon me; to the which my duties</LINE>
<LINE>Are with a most indissoluble tie</LINE>
<LINE>For ever knit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ride you this afternoon?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BANQUO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, my good lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We should have else desired your good advice,</LINE>
<LINE>Which still hath been both grave and prosperous,</LINE>
<LINE>In this day's council; but we'll take to-morrow.</LINE>
<LINE>Is't far you ride?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BANQUO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As far, my lord, as will fill up the time</LINE>
<LINE>'Twixt this and supper: go not my horse the better,</LINE>
<LINE>I must become a borrower of the night</LINE>
<LINE>For a dark hour or twain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fail not our feast.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BANQUO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, I will not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We hear, our bloody cousins are bestow'd</LINE>
<LINE>In England and in Ireland, not confessing</LINE>
<LINE>Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers</LINE>
<LINE>With strange invention: but of that to-morrow,</LINE>
<LINE>When therewithal we shall have cause of state</LINE>
<LINE>Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse: adieu,</LINE>
<LINE>Till you return at night. Goes Fleance with you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BANQUO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, my good lord: our time does call upon 's.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I wish your horses swift and sure of foot;</LINE>
<LINE>And so I do commend you to their backs. Farewell.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit BANQUO</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Let every man be master of his time</LINE>
<LINE>Till seven at night: to make society</LINE>
<LINE>The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself</LINE>
<LINE>Till supper-time alone: while then, God be with you!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt all but MACBETH, and an attendant</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Sirrah, a word with you: attend those men</LINE>
<LINE>Our pleasure?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ATTENDANT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They are, my lord, without the palace gate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bring them before us.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Attendant</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>To be thus is nothing;</LINE>
<LINE>But to be safely thus.--Our fears in Banquo</LINE>
<LINE>Stick deep; and in his royalty of nature</LINE>
<LINE>Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;</LINE>
<LINE>And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,</LINE>
<LINE>He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour</LINE>
<LINE>To act in safety. There is none but he</LINE>
<LINE>Whose being I do fear: and, under him,</LINE>
<LINE>My Genius is rebuked; as, it is said,</LINE>
<LINE>Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters</LINE>
<LINE>When first they put the name of king upon me,</LINE>
<LINE>And bade them speak to him: then prophet-like</LINE>
<LINE>They hail'd him father to a line of kings:</LINE>
<LINE>Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,</LINE>
<LINE>And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,</LINE>
<LINE>Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,</LINE>
<LINE>No son of mine succeeding. If 't be so,</LINE>
<LINE>For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind;</LINE>
<LINE>For them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd;</LINE>
<LINE>Put rancours in the vessel of my peace</LINE>
<LINE>Only for them; and mine eternal jewel</LINE>
<LINE>Given to the common enemy of man,</LINE>
<LINE>To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!</LINE>
<LINE>Rather than so, come fate into the list.</LINE>
<LINE>And champion me to the utterance! Who's there!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Re-enter Attendant, with two Murderers</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Now go to the door, and stay there till we call.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Attendant</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Was it not yesterday we spoke together?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It was, so please your highness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well then, now</LINE>
<LINE>Have you consider'd of my speeches? Know</LINE>
<LINE>That it was he in the times past which held you</LINE>
<LINE>So under fortune, which you thought had been</LINE>
<LINE>Our innocent self: this I made good to you</LINE>
<LINE>In our last conference, pass'd in probation with you,</LINE>
<LINE>How you were borne in hand, how cross'd,</LINE>
<LINE>the instruments,</LINE>
<LINE>Who wrought with them, and all things else that might</LINE>
<LINE>To half a soul and to a notion crazed</LINE>
<LINE>Say 'Thus did Banquo.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You made it known to us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I did so, and went further, which is now</LINE>
<LINE>Our point of second meeting. Do you find</LINE>
<LINE>Your patience so predominant in your nature</LINE>
<LINE>That you can let this go? Are you so gospell'd</LINE>
<LINE>To pray for this good man and for his issue,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave</LINE>
<LINE>And beggar'd yours for ever?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We are men, my liege.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men;</LINE>
<LINE>As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,</LINE>
<LINE>Shoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolves, are clept</LINE>
<LINE>All by the name of dogs: the valued file</LINE>
<LINE>Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,</LINE>
<LINE>The housekeeper, the hunter, every one</LINE>
<LINE>According to the gift which bounteous nature</LINE>
<LINE>Hath in him closed; whereby he does receive</LINE>
<LINE>Particular addition. from the bill</LINE>
<LINE>That writes them all alike: and so of men.</LINE>
<LINE>Now, if you have a station in the file,</LINE>
<LINE>Not i' the worst rank of manhood, say 't;</LINE>
<LINE>And I will put that business in your bosoms,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose execution takes your enemy off,</LINE>
<LINE>Grapples you to the heart and love of us,</LINE>
<LINE>Who wear our health but sickly in his life,</LINE>
<LINE>Which in his death were perfect.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am one, my liege,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world</LINE>
<LINE>Have so incensed that I am reckless what</LINE>
<LINE>I do to spite the world.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I another</LINE>
<LINE>So weary with disasters, tugg'd with fortune,</LINE>
<LINE>That I would set my lie on any chance,</LINE>
<LINE>To mend it, or be rid on't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Both of you</LINE>
<LINE>Know Banquo was your enemy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Both Murderers</SPEAKER>
<LINE>True, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So is he mine; and in such bloody distance,</LINE>
<LINE>That every minute of his being thrusts</LINE>
<LINE>Against my near'st of life: and though I could</LINE>
<LINE>With barefaced power sweep him from my sight</LINE>
<LINE>And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,</LINE>
<LINE>For certain friends that are both his and mine,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall</LINE>
<LINE>Who I myself struck down; and thence it is,</LINE>
<LINE>That I to your assistance do make love,</LINE>
<LINE>Masking the business from the common eye</LINE>
<LINE>For sundry weighty reasons.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We shall, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Perform what you command us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Though our lives--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most</LINE>
<LINE>I will advise you where to plant yourselves;</LINE>
<LINE>Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time,</LINE>
<LINE>The moment on't; for't must be done to-night,</LINE>
<LINE>And something from the palace; always thought</LINE>
<LINE>That I require a clearness: and with him--</LINE>
<LINE>To leave no rubs nor botches in the work--</LINE>
<LINE>Fleance his son, that keeps him company,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose absence is no less material to me</LINE>
<LINE>Than is his father's, must embrace the fate</LINE>
<LINE>Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart:</LINE>
<LINE>I'll come to you anon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Both Murderers</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We are resolved, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll call upon you straight: abide within.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Murderers</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul's flight,</LINE>
<LINE>If it find heaven, must find it out to-night.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter LADY MACBETH and a Servant</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is Banquo gone from court?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Servant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, madam, but returns again to-night.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say to the king, I would attend his leisure</LINE>
<LINE>For a few words.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Servant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, I will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nought's had, all's spent,</LINE>
<LINE>Where our desire is got without content:</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis safer to be that which we destroy</LINE>
<LINE>Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter MACBETH</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How now, my lord! why do you keep alone,</LINE>
<LINE>Of sorriest fancies your companions making,</LINE>
<LINE>Using those thoughts which should indeed have died</LINE>
<LINE>With them they think on? Things without all remedy</LINE>
<LINE>Should be without regard: what's done is done.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it:</LINE>
<LINE>She'll close and be herself, whilst our poor malice</LINE>
<LINE>Remains in danger of her former tooth.</LINE>
<LINE>But let the frame of things disjoint, both the</LINE>
<LINE>worlds suffer,</LINE>
<LINE>Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep</LINE>
<LINE>In the affliction of these terrible dreams</LINE>
<LINE>That shake us nightly: better be with the dead,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,</LINE>
<LINE>Than on the torture of the mind to lie</LINE>
<LINE>In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;</LINE>
<LINE>After life's fitful fever he sleeps well;</LINE>
<LINE>Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,</LINE>
<LINE>Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,</LINE>
<LINE>Can touch him further.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come on;</LINE>
<LINE>Gentle my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks;</LINE>
<LINE>Be bright and jovial among your guests to-night.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you:</LINE>
<LINE>Let your remembrance apply to Banquo;</LINE>
<LINE>Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue:</LINE>
<LINE>Unsafe the while, that we</LINE>
<LINE>Must lave our honours in these flattering streams,</LINE>
<LINE>And make our faces vizards to our hearts,</LINE>
<LINE>Disguising what they are.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You must leave this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!</LINE>
<LINE>Thou know'st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But in them nature's copy's not eterne.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There's comfort yet; they are assailable;</LINE>
<LINE>Then be thou jocund: ere the bat hath flown</LINE>
<LINE>His cloister'd flight, ere to black Hecate's summons</LINE>
<LINE>The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums</LINE>
<LINE>Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done</LINE>
<LINE>A deed of dreadful note.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's to be done?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,</LINE>
<LINE>Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,</LINE>
<LINE>Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day;</LINE>
<LINE>And with thy bloody and invisible hand</LINE>
<LINE>Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond</LINE>
<LINE>Which keeps me pale! Light thickens; and the crow</LINE>
<LINE>Makes wing to the rooky wood:</LINE>
<LINE>Good things of day begin to droop and drowse;</LINE>
<LINE>While night's black agents to their preys do rouse.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou marvell'st at my words: but hold thee still;</LINE>
<LINE>Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.</LINE>
<LINE>So, prithee, go with me.</LINE>

<LINE>Our offices and what we have to do</LINE>
<LINE>To the direction just.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then stand with us.</LINE>
<LINE>The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day:</LINE>

<LINE>The subject of our watch.</LINE>

<LINE>Most royal sir,</LINE>

<LINE>Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,</LINE>
<LINE>As broad and general as the casing air:</LINE>
<LINE>But now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confined, bound in</LINE>

<SPEAKER>First Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, my good lord: safe in a ditch he bides,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thanks for that:</LINE>

<LINE>Impostors to true fear, would well become</LINE>
<LINE>A woman's story at a winter's fire,</LINE>
<LINE>Authorized by her grandam. Shame itself!</LINE>
<LINE>Why do you make such faces? When all's done,</LINE>

<LINE>Blood hath been shed ere now, i' the olden time,</LINE>
<LINE>Ere human statute purged the gentle weal;</LINE>
<LINE>Ay, and since too, murders have been perform'd</LINE>
<LINE>Too terrible for the ear: the times have been,</LINE>
<LINE>That, when the brains were out, the man would die,</LINE>
<LINE>And there an end; but now they rise again,</LINE>

<LINE>Then I'll sit down. Give me some wine; fill full.</LINE>
<LINE>I drink to the general joy o' the whole table,</LINE>

<LINE>Shall never tremble: or be alive again,</LINE>
<LINE>And dare me to the desert with thy sword;</LINE>
<LINE>If trembling I inhabit then, protest me</LINE>

<LINE>Can such things be,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HECATE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have I not reason, beldams as you are,</LINE>
<LINE>Saucy and overbold? How did you dare</LINE>
<LINE>To trade and traffic with Macbeth</LINE>
<LINE>In riddles and affairs of death;</LINE>
<LINE>And I, the mistress of your charms,</LINE>
<LINE>The close contriver of all harms,</LINE>
<LINE>Was never call'd to bear my part,</LINE>
<LINE>Or show the glory of our art?</LINE>
<LINE>And, which is worse, all you have done</LINE>
<LINE>Hath been but for a wayward son,</LINE>
<LINE>Spiteful and wrathful, who, as others do,</LINE>
<LINE>Loves for his own ends, not for you.</LINE>
<LINE>But make amends now: get you gone,</LINE>
<LINE>And at the pit of Acheron</LINE>
<LINE>Meet me i' the morning: thither he</LINE>
<LINE>Will come to know his destiny:</LINE>
<LINE>Your vessels and your spells provide,</LINE>
<LINE>Your charms and every thing beside.</LINE>
<LINE>I am for the air; this night I'll spend</LINE>
<LINE>Unto a dismal and a fatal end:</LINE>
<LINE>Great business must be wrought ere noon:</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the corner of the moon</LINE>
<LINE>There hangs a vaporous drop profound;</LINE>
<LINE>I'll catch it ere it come to ground:</LINE>
<LINE>And that distill'd by magic sleights</LINE>
<LINE>Shall raise such artificial sprites</LINE>
<LINE>As by the strength of their illusion</LINE>
<LINE>Shall draw him on to his confusion:</LINE>
<LINE>He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter LENNOX and another Lord</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LENNOX</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,</LINE>
<LINE>Which can interpret further: only, I say,</LINE>
<LINE>Things have been strangely borne. The</LINE>
<LINE>gracious Duncan</LINE>
<LINE>Was pitied of Macbeth: marry, he was dead:</LINE>
<LINE>And the right-valiant Banquo walk'd too late;</LINE>
<LINE>Whom, you may say, if't please you, Fleance kill'd,</LINE>
<LINE>For Fleance fled: men must not walk too late.</LINE>
<LINE>Who cannot want the thought how monstrous</LINE>
<LINE>It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain</LINE>
<LINE>To kill their gracious father? damned fact!</LINE>
<LINE>How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight</LINE>
<LINE>In pious rage the two delinquents tear,</LINE>
<LINE>That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?</LINE>
<LINE>Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;</LINE>
<LINE>For 'twould have anger'd any heart alive</LINE>
<LINE>To hear the men deny't. So that, I say,</LINE>
<LINE>He has borne all things well: and I do think</LINE>
<LINE>That had he Duncan's sons under his key--</LINE>
<LINE>As, an't please heaven, he shall not--they</LINE>
<LINE>should find</LINE>
<LINE>What 'twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.</LINE>
<LINE>But, peace! for from broad words and 'cause he fail'd</LINE>
<LINE>His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear</LINE>
<LINE>Macduff lives in disgrace: sir, can you tell</LINE>
<LINE>Where he bestows himself?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The son of Duncan,</LINE>
<LINE>From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth</LINE>
<LINE>Lives in the English court, and is received</LINE>
<LINE>Of the most pious Edward with such grace</LINE>
<LINE>That the malevolence of fortune nothing</LINE>
<LINE>Takes from his high respect: thither Macduff</LINE>
<LINE>Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid</LINE>
<LINE>To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward:</LINE>
<LINE>That, by the help of these--with Him above</LINE>
<LINE>To ratify the work--we may again</LINE>
<LINE>Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,</LINE>
<LINE>Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,</LINE>
<LINE>Do faithful homage and receive free honours:</LINE>
<LINE>All which we pine for now: and this report</LINE>
<LINE>Hath so exasperate the king that he</LINE>
<LINE>Prepares for some attempt of war.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LENNOX</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sent he to Macduff?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He did: and with an absolute 'Sir, not I,'</LINE>
<LINE>The cloudy messenger turns me his back,</LINE>
<LINE>And hums, as who should say 'You'll rue the time</LINE>
<LINE>That clogs me with this answer.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LENNOX</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And that well might</LINE>
<LINE>Advise him to a caution, to hold what distance</LINE>
<LINE>His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel</LINE>
<LINE>Fly to the court of England and unfold</LINE>
<LINE>His message ere he come, that a swift blessing</LINE>
<LINE>May soon return to this our suffering country</LINE>
<LINE>Under a hand accursed!</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Infected be the air whereon they ride;</LINE>

<LINE>Time, thou anticipatest my dread exploits:</LINE>
<LINE>The flighty purpose never is o'ertook</LINE>
<LINE>Unless the deed go with it; from this moment</LINE>
<LINE>The very firstlings of my heart shall be</LINE>
<LINE>The firstlings of my hand. And even now,</LINE>
<LINE>To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done:</LINE>
<LINE>The castle of Macduff I will surprise;</LINE>
<LINE>Seize upon Fife; give to the edge o' the sword</LINE>
<LINE>His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls</LINE>
<LINE>That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool;</LINE>

<SPEAKER>LADY MACDUFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What had he done, to make him fly the land?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You must have patience, madam.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY MACDUFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He had none:</LINE>
<LINE>His flight was madness: when our actions do not,</LINE>
<LINE>Our fears do make us traitors.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You know not</LINE>
<LINE>Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY MACDUFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wisdom! to leave his wife, to leave his babes,</LINE>
<LINE>His mansion and his titles in a place</LINE>
<LINE>From whence himself does fly? He loves us not;</LINE>
<LINE>He wants the natural touch: for the poor wren,</LINE>
<LINE>The most diminutive of birds, will fight,</LINE>
<LINE>Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.</LINE>
<LINE>All is the fear and nothing is the love;</LINE>
<LINE>As little is the wisdom, where the flight</LINE>
<LINE>So runs against all reason.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My dearest coz,</LINE>
<LINE>I pray you, school yourself: but for your husband,</LINE>
<LINE>He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows</LINE>
<LINE>The fits o' the season. I dare not speak</LINE>
<LINE>much further;</LINE>
<LINE>But cruel are the times, when we are traitors</LINE>
<LINE>And do not know ourselves, when we hold rumour</LINE>
<LINE>From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,</LINE>
<LINE>But float upon a wild and violent sea</LINE>
<LINE>Each way and move. I take my leave of you:</LINE>
<LINE>Shall not be long but I'll be here again:</LINE>
<LINE>Things at the worst will cease, or else climb upward</LINE>
<LINE>To what they were before. My pretty cousin,</LINE>
<LINE>Blessing upon you!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY MACDUFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Father'd he is, and yet he's fatherless.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am so much a fool, should I stay longer,</LINE>
<LINE>It would be my disgrace and your discomfort:</LINE>
<LINE>I take my leave at once.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>Why should I, mother? Poor birds they are not set for.</LINE>
<LINE>My father is not dead, for all your saying.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY MACDUFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, he is dead; how wilt thou do for a father?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Son</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, how will you do for a husband?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY MACDUFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Son</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then you'll buy 'em to sell again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Son</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is a traitor?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY MACDUFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, one that swears and lies.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Son</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And be all traitors that do so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY MACDUFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Every one that does so is a traitor, and must be hanged.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY MACDUFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, the honest men.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Son</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then the liars and swearers are fools,</LINE>
<LINE>for there are liars and swearers enow to beat</LINE>

<LINE>Now, God help thee, poor monkey!</LINE>
<LINE>But how wilt thou do for a father?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Son</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If he were dead, you'ld weep for</LINE>

<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you known,</LINE>

<LINE>I doubt some danger does approach you nearly:</LINE>
<LINE>If you will take a homely man's advice,</LINE>
<LINE>Be not found here; hence, with your little ones.</LINE>
<LINE>To fright you thus, methinks, I am too savage;</LINE>
<LINE>To do worse to you were fell cruelty,</LINE>

<LINE>Whither should I fly?</LINE>
<LINE>I have done no harm. But I remember now</LINE>
<LINE>I am in this earthly world; where to do harm</LINE>
<LINE>Is often laudable, to do good sometime</LINE>
<LINE>Accounted dangerous folly: why then, alas,</LINE>
<LINE>Do I put up that womanly defence,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter MALCOLM and MACDUFF</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MALCOLM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let us seek out some desolate shade, and there</LINE>
<LINE>Weep our sad bosoms empty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACDUFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let us rather</LINE>
<LINE>Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men</LINE>
<LINE>Bestride our down-fall'n birthdom: each new morn</LINE>
<LINE>New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows</LINE>
<LINE>Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds</LINE>
<LINE>As if it felt with Scotland and yell'd out</LINE>
<LINE>Like syllable of dolour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MALCOLM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What I believe I'll wail,</LINE>
<LINE>What know believe, and what I can redress,</LINE>
<LINE>As I shall find the time to friend, I will.</LINE>
<LINE>What you have spoke, it may be so perchance.</LINE>
<LINE>This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,</LINE>
<LINE>Was once thought honest: you have loved him well.</LINE>
<LINE>He hath not touch'd you yet. I am young;</LINE>
<LINE>but something</LINE>
<LINE>You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom</LINE>
<LINE>To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb</LINE>
<LINE>To appease an angry god.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACDUFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am not treacherous.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MALCOLM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But Macbeth is.</LINE>
<LINE>A good and virtuous nature may recoil</LINE>
<LINE>In an imperial charge. But I shall crave</LINE>
<LINE>your pardon;</LINE>
<LINE>That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose:</LINE>
<LINE>Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell;</LINE>
<LINE>Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet grace must still look so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACDUFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have lost my hopes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MALCOLM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.</LINE>
<LINE>Why in that rawness left you wife and child,</LINE>
<LINE>Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,</LINE>
<LINE>Without leave-taking? I pray you,</LINE>
<LINE>Let not my jealousies be your dishonours,</LINE>
<LINE>But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,</LINE>
<LINE>Whatever I shall think.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACDUFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bleed, bleed, poor country!</LINE>
<LINE>Great tyranny! lay thou thy basis sure,</LINE>
<LINE>For goodness dare not cheque thee: wear thou</LINE>
<LINE>thy wrongs;</LINE>
<LINE>The title is affeer'd! Fare thee well, lord:</LINE>
<LINE>I would not be the villain that thou think'st</LINE>
<LINE>For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp,</LINE>
<LINE>And the rich East to boot.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MALCOLM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be not offended:</LINE>
<LINE>I speak not as in absolute fear of you.</LINE>
<LINE>I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;</LINE>
<LINE>It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash</LINE>
<LINE>Is added to her wounds: I think withal</LINE>
<LINE>There would be hands uplifted in my right;</LINE>
<LINE>And here from gracious England have I offer</LINE>
<LINE>Of goodly thousands: but, for all this,</LINE>
<LINE>When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head,</LINE>
<LINE>Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country</LINE>
<LINE>Shall have more vices than it had before,</LINE>
<LINE>More suffer and more sundry ways than ever,</LINE>
<LINE>By him that shall succeed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACDUFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What should he be?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MALCOLM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is myself I mean: in whom I know</LINE>
<LINE>All the particulars of vice so grafted</LINE>
<LINE>That, when they shall be open'd, black Macbeth</LINE>
<LINE>Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state</LINE>
<LINE>Esteem him as a lamb, being compared</LINE>
<LINE>With my confineless harms.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACDUFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not in the legions</LINE>
<LINE>Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd</LINE>
<LINE>In evils to top Macbeth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MALCOLM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I grant him bloody,</LINE>
<LINE>Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,</LINE>
<LINE>Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin</LINE>
<LINE>That has a name: but there's no bottom, none,</LINE>
<LINE>In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,</LINE>
<LINE>Your matrons and your maids, could not fill up</LINE>
<LINE>The cistern of my lust, and my desire</LINE>
<LINE>All continent impediments would o'erbear</LINE>
<LINE>That did oppose my will: better Macbeth</LINE>
<LINE>Than such an one to reign.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACDUFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Boundless intemperance</LINE>
<LINE>In nature is a tyranny; it hath been</LINE>
<LINE>The untimely emptying of the happy throne</LINE>
<LINE>And fall of many kings. But fear not yet</LINE>
<LINE>To take upon you what is yours: you may</LINE>
<LINE>Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink.</LINE>
<LINE>We have willing dames enough: there cannot be</LINE>
<LINE>That vulture in you, to devour so many</LINE>
<LINE>As will to greatness dedicate themselves,</LINE>
<LINE>Finding it so inclined.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MALCOLM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With this there grows</LINE>
<LINE>In my most ill-composed affection such</LINE>
<LINE>A stanchless avarice that, were I king,</LINE>
<LINE>I should cut off the nobles for their lands,</LINE>
<LINE>Desire his jewels and this other's house:</LINE>
<LINE>And my more-having would be as a sauce</LINE>
<LINE>To make me hunger more; that I should forge</LINE>
<LINE>Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,</LINE>
<LINE>Destroying them for wealth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACDUFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This avarice</LINE>
<LINE>Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root</LINE>
<LINE>Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been</LINE>
<LINE>The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;</LINE>
<LINE>Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will.</LINE>
<LINE>Of your mere own: all these are portable,</LINE>
<LINE>With other graces weigh'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MALCOLM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But I have none: the king-becoming graces,</LINE>
<LINE>As justice, verity, temperance, stableness,</LINE>
<LINE>Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,</LINE>
<LINE>Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,</LINE>
<LINE>I have no relish of them, but abound</LINE>
<LINE>In the division of each several crime,</LINE>
<LINE>Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should</LINE>
<LINE>Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,</LINE>
<LINE>Uproar the universal peace, confound</LINE>
<LINE>All unity on earth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACDUFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Scotland, Scotland!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MALCOLM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If such a one be fit to govern, speak:</LINE>
<LINE>I am as I have spoken.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACDUFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fit to govern!</LINE>
<LINE>No, not to live. O nation miserable,</LINE>
<LINE>With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter'd,</LINE>
<LINE>When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,</LINE>
<LINE>Since that the truest issue of thy throne</LINE>
<LINE>By his own interdiction stands accursed,</LINE>
<LINE>And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father</LINE>
<LINE>Was a most sainted king: the queen that bore thee,</LINE>
<LINE>Oftener upon her knees than on her feet,</LINE>
<LINE>Died every day she lived. Fare thee well!</LINE>
<LINE>These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself</LINE>
<LINE>Have banish'd me from Scotland. O my breast,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy hope ends here!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MALCOLM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Macduff, this noble passion,</LINE>
<LINE>Child of integrity, hath from my soul</LINE>
<LINE>Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts</LINE>
<LINE>To thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth</LINE>
<LINE>By many of these trains hath sought to win me</LINE>
<LINE>Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me</LINE>
<LINE>From over-credulous haste: but God above</LINE>
<LINE>Deal between thee and me! for even now</LINE>
<LINE>I put myself to thy direction, and</LINE>
<LINE>Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure</LINE>
<LINE>The taints and blames I laid upon myself,</LINE>
<LINE>For strangers to my nature. I am yet</LINE>
<LINE>Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,</LINE>
<LINE>Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,</LINE>
<LINE>At no time broke my faith, would not betray</LINE>
<LINE>The devil to his fellow and delight</LINE>
<LINE>No less in truth than life: my first false speaking</LINE>
<LINE>Was this upon myself: what I am truly,</LINE>
<LINE>Is thine and my poor country's to command:</LINE>
<LINE>Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,</LINE>
<LINE>Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,</LINE>
<LINE>Already at a point, was setting forth.</LINE>
<LINE>Now we'll together; and the chance of goodness</LINE>
<LINE>Be like our warranted quarrel! Why are you silent?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACDUFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Such welcome and unwelcome things at once</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis hard to reconcile.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter a Doctor</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MALCOLM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well; more anon.--Comes the king forth, I pray you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Doctor</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, sir; there are a crew of wretched souls</LINE>
<LINE>That stay his cure: their malady convinces</LINE>
<LINE>The great assay of art; but at his touch--</LINE>
<LINE>Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand--</LINE>
<LINE>They presently amend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MALCOLM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thank you, doctor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exit Doctor</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACDUFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's the disease he means?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MALCOLM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis call'd the evil:</LINE>
<LINE>A most miraculous work in this good king;</LINE>
<LINE>Which often, since my here-remain in England,</LINE>
<LINE>I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>Himself best knows: but strangely-visited people,</LINE>
<LINE>All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,</LINE>
<LINE>The mere despair of surgery, he cures,</LINE>
<LINE>Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,</LINE>
<LINE>Put on with holy prayers: and 'tis spoken,</LINE>
<LINE>To the succeeding royalty he leaves</LINE>
<LINE>The healing benediction. With this strange virtue,</LINE>
<LINE>He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,</LINE>
<LINE>And sundry blessings hang about his throne,</LINE>
<LINE>That speak him full of grace.</LINE>

<LINE>Stands Scotland where it did?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, poor country!</LINE>
<LINE>Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot</LINE>
<LINE>Be call'd our mother, but our grave; where nothing,</LINE>
<LINE>But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;</LINE>
<LINE>Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air</LINE>
<LINE>Are made, not mark'd; where violent sorrow seems</LINE>
<LINE>A modern ecstasy; the dead man's knell</LINE>
<LINE>Is there scarce ask'd for who; and good men's lives</LINE>
<LINE>Expire before the flowers in their caps,</LINE>
<LINE>Dying or ere they sicken.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When I came hither to transport the tidings,</LINE>
<LINE>Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour</LINE>
<LINE>Of many worthy fellows that were out;</LINE>
<LINE>Which was to my belief witness'd the rather,</LINE>
<LINE>For that I saw the tyrant's power a-foot:</LINE>
<LINE>Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland</LINE>
<LINE>Would create soldiers, make our women fight,</LINE>
<LINE>To doff their dire distresses.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MALCOLM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be't their comfort</LINE>
<LINE>We are coming thither: gracious England hath</LINE>
<LINE>Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;</LINE>
<LINE>An older and a better soldier none</LINE>
<LINE>That Christendom gives out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Would I could answer</LINE>
<LINE>This comfort with the like! But I have words</LINE>
<LINE>That would be howl'd out in the desert air,</LINE>
<LINE>Where hearing should not latch them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACDUFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What concern they?</LINE>
<LINE>The general cause? or is it a fee-grief</LINE>
<LINE>Due to some single breast?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No mind that's honest</LINE>
<LINE>But in it shares some woe; though the main part</LINE>
<LINE>Pertains to you alone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACDUFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If it be mine,</LINE>
<LINE>Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever,</LINE>
<LINE>Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound</LINE>
<LINE>That ever yet they heard.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACDUFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hum! I guess at it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your castle is surprised; your wife and babes</LINE>
<LINE>Savagely slaughter'd: to relate the manner,</LINE>
<LINE>Were, on the quarry of these murder'd deer,</LINE>
<LINE>To add the death of you.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MALCOLM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Merciful heaven!</LINE>
<LINE>What, man! ne'er pull your hat upon your brows;</LINE>
<LINE>Give sorrow words: the grief that does not speak</LINE>
<LINE>Whispers the o'er-fraught heart and bids it break.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>My children too?</LINE>

<LINE>My wife kill'd too?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have said.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>MALCOLM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be comforted:</LINE>

<LINE>He has no children. All my pretty ones?</LINE>

<LINE>At one fell swoop?</LINE>

<LINE>Dispute it like a man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACDUFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I shall do so;</LINE>
<LINE>But I must also feel it as a man:</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot but remember such things were,</LINE>
<LINE>That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on,</LINE>
<LINE>And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,</LINE>
<LINE>They were all struck for thee! naught that I am,</LINE>
<LINE>Not for their own demerits, but for mine,</LINE>
<LINE>Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MALCOLM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be this the whetstone of your sword: let grief</LINE>
<LINE>Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACDUFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, I could play the woman with mine eyes</LINE>
<LINE>And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens,</LINE>
<LINE>Cut short all intermission; front to front</LINE>
<LINE>Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;</LINE>
<LINE>Within my sword's length set him; if he 'scape,</LINE>
<LINE>Heaven forgive him too!</LINE>

<LINE>Come, go we to the king; our power is ready;</LINE>
<LINE>Our lack is nothing but our leave; Macbeth</LINE>

<LINE>Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may:</LINE>

<SPEAKER>Doctor</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive</LINE>
<LINE>no truth in your report. When was it she last walked?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Gentlewoman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen</LINE>
<LINE>her rise from her bed, throw her night-gown upon</LINE>
<LINE>her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it,</LINE>
<LINE>write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it, and again</LINE>
<LINE>return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Doctor</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once</LINE>
<LINE>the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of</LINE>
<LINE>watching! In this slumbery agitation, besides her</LINE>
<LINE>walking and other actual performances, what, at any</LINE>
<LINE>time, have you heard her say?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Gentlewoman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That, sir, which I will not report after her.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter LADY MACBETH, with a taper</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Lo you, here she comes! This is her very guise;</LINE>
<LINE>and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Doctor</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How came she by that light?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Gentlewoman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, it stood by her: she has light by her</LINE>
<LINE>continually; 'tis her command.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Doctor</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You see, her eyes are open.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Gentlewoman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, but their sense is shut.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Doctor</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is it she does now? Look, how she rubs her hands.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Gentlewoman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus</LINE>
<LINE>washing her hands: I have known her continue in</LINE>
<LINE>this a quarter of an hour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet here's a spot.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Hark! she speaks: I will set down what comes from</LINE>
<LINE>her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Out, damned spot! out, I say!--One: two: why,</LINE>
<LINE>then, 'tis time to do't.--Hell is murky!--Fie, my</LINE>
<LINE>lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we</LINE>
<LINE>fear who knows it, when none can call our power to</LINE>
<LINE>account?--Yet who would have thought the old man</LINE>
<LINE>to have had so much blood in him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Doctor</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you mark that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The thane of Fife had a wife: where is she now?--</LINE>
<LINE>What, will these hands ne'er be clean?--No more o'</LINE>
<LINE>that, my lord, no more o' that: you mar all with</LINE>
<LINE>this starting.</LINE>

<LINE>that: heaven knows what she has known.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here's the smell of the blood still: all the</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Doctor</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Gentlewoman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the</LINE>

<LINE>God, God forgive us all! Look after her;</LINE>
<LINE>Remove from her the means of all annoyance,</LINE>

<LINE>To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,</LINE>
<LINE>Creeps in this petty pace from day to day</LINE>
<LINE>To the last syllable of recorded time,</LINE>
<LINE>And all our yesterdays have lighted fools</LINE>
<LINE>The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!</LINE>
<LINE>Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player</LINE>
<LINE>That struts and frets his hour upon the stage</LINE>
<LINE>And then is heard no more: it is a tale</LINE>
<LINE>Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,</LINE>
<LINE>Signifying nothing.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter a Messenger</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Thou comest to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gracious my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>I should report that which I say I saw,</LINE>
<LINE>But know not how to do it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, say, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As I did stand my watch upon the hill,</LINE>
<LINE>I look'd toward Birnam, and anon, methought,</LINE>
<LINE>The wood began to move.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Liar and slave!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so:</LINE>
<LINE>Within this three mile may you see it coming;</LINE>
<LINE>I say, a moving grove.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If thou speak'st false,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,</LINE>
<LINE>Till famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth,</LINE>
<LINE>I care not if thou dost for me as much.</LINE>
<LINE>I pull in resolution, and begin</LINE>
<LINE>To doubt the equivocation of the fiend</LINE>
<LINE>That lies like truth: 'Fear not, till Birnam wood</LINE>
<LINE>Do come to Dunsinane:'  and now a wood</LINE>
<LINE>Comes toward Dunsinane. Arm, arm, and out!</LINE>
<LINE>If this which he avouches does appear,</LINE>
<LINE>There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.</LINE>
<LINE>I gin to be aweary of the sun,</LINE>
<LINE>And wish the estate o' the world were now undone.</LINE>
<LINE>Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!</LINE>
<LINE>At least we'll die with harness on our back.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>MALCOLM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now near enough: your leafy screens throw down.</LINE>

<LINE>Shall, with my cousin, your right-noble son,</LINE>
<LINE>Lead our first battle: worthy Macduff and we</LINE>
<LINE>Shall take upon 's what else remains to do,</LINE>
<LINE>According to our order.</LINE>

<LINE>Fare you well.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly,</LINE>

</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter YOUNG SIWARD</STAGEDIR>

<SPEAKER>YOUNG SIWARD</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou'lt be afraid to hear it.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My name's Macbeth.</LINE>

<LINE>The devil himself could not pronounce a title</LINE>

<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, nor more fearful.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>YOUNG SIWARD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou liest, abhorred tyrant; with my sword</LINE>
<LINE>I'll prove the lie thou speak'st.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>They fight and YOUNG SIWARD is slain</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou wast born of woman</LINE>

<LINE>That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face!</LINE>
<LINE>If thou be'st slain and with no stroke of mine,</LINE>
<LINE>My wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still.</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms</LINE>
<LINE>Are hired to bear their staves: either thou, Macbeth,</LINE>
<LINE>Or else my sword with an unbatter'd edge</LINE>
<LINE>I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;</LINE>
<LINE>By this great clatter, one of greatest note</LINE>
<LINE>Seems bruited. Let me find him, fortune!</LINE>

<LINE>This way, my lord; the castle's gently render'd:</LINE>

<LINE>The day almost itself professes yours,</LINE>

<LINE>Of all men else I have avoided thee:</LINE>

<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou losest labour:</LINE>

<LINE>I bear a charmed life, which must not yield,</LINE>
<LINE>To one of woman born.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACDUFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Despair thy charm;</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,</LINE>

<LINE>And be these juggling fiends no more believed,</LINE>
<LINE>That palter with us in a double sense;</LINE>
<LINE>That keep the word of promise to our ear,</LINE>
<LINE>And break it to our hope. I'll not fight with thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACDUFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then yield thee, coward,</LINE>
<LINE>And live to be the show and gaze o' the time:</LINE>

<LINE>Painted on a pole, and underwrit,</LINE>
<LINE>'Here may you see the tyrant.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will not yield,</LINE>

<LINE>And to be baited with the rabble's curse.</LINE>
<LINE>Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane,</LINE>
<LINE>And thou opposed, being of no woman born,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet I will try the last. Before my body</LINE>

<SPEAKER>MALCOLM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Macduff is missing, and your noble son.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt:</LINE>
<LINE>He only lived but till he was a man;</LINE>
<LINE>The which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd</LINE>
<LINE>In the unshrinking station where he fought,</LINE>
<LINE>But like a man he died.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIWARD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then he is dead?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, and brought off the field: your cause of sorrow</LINE>
<LINE>Must not be measured by his worth, for then</LINE>
<LINE>It hath no end.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIWARD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Had he his hurts before?</LINE>

<SPEAKER>ROSS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, on the front.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIWARD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why then, God's soldier be he!</LINE>
<LINE>Had I as many sons as I have hairs,</LINE>
<LINE>I would not wish them to a fairer death:</LINE>
<LINE>And so, his knell is knoll'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MALCOLM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He's worth more sorrow,</LINE>
<LINE>And that I'll spend for him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIWARD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He's worth no more</LINE>
<LINE>They say he parted well, and paid his score:</LINE>

<LINE>In such an honour named. What's more to do,</LINE>
<LINE>Which would be planted newly with the time,</LINE>
<LINE>As calling home our exiled friends abroad</LINE>
<LINE>That fled the snares of watchful tyranny;</LINE>
<LINE>Producing forth the cruel ministers</LINE>
<LINE>Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen,</LINE>
<LINE>Who, as 'tis thought, by self and violent hands</LINE>
<LINE>Took off her life; this, and what needful else</LINE>
<LINE>That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace,</LINE>
