<LINE>Two households, both alike in dignity,</LINE>
<LINE>In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,</LINE>
<LINE>From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,</LINE>
<LINE>Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.</LINE>
<LINE>From forth the fatal loins of these two foes</LINE>
<LINE>A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;</LINE>
<LINE>Whole misadventured piteous overthrows</LINE>
<LINE>Do with their death bury their parents' strife.</LINE>
<LINE>The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,</LINE>
<LINE>And the continuance of their parents' rage,</LINE>
<LINE>Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,</LINE>
<LINE>Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;</LINE>
<LINE>The which if you with patient ears attend,</LINE>
<LINE>What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</LINE>

</PROLOGUE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE I.  Verona. A public place.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet,
armed with swords and bucklers</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAMPSON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREGORY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, for then we should be colliers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAMPSON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREGORY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAMPSON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I strike quickly, being moved.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREGORY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But thou art not quickly moved to strike.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAMPSON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A dog of the house of Montague moves me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREGORY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:</LINE>
<LINE>therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAMPSON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will</LINE>
<LINE>take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREGORY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes</LINE>
<LINE>to the wall.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAMPSON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,</LINE>
<LINE>are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push</LINE>
<LINE>Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids</LINE>
<LINE>to the wall.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREGORY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAMPSON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I</LINE>
<LINE>have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the</LINE>
<LINE>maids, and cut off their heads.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREGORY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The heads of the maids?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAMPSON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;</LINE>
<LINE>take it in what sense thou wilt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREGORY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They must take it in sense that feel it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAMPSON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and</LINE>
<LINE>'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREGORY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou</LINE>
<LINE>hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes</LINE>
<LINE>two of the house of the Montagues.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAMPSON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREGORY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How! turn thy back and run?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAMPSON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fear me not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREGORY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, marry; I fear thee!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAMPSON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREGORY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as</LINE>
<LINE>they list.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAMPSON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;</LINE>
<LINE>which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ABRAHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAMPSON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do bite my thumb, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ABRAHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAMPSON</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside to GREGORY</STAGEDIR>  Is the law of our side, if I say</LINE>
<LINE>ay?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREGORY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAMPSON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I</LINE>
<LINE>bite my thumb, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREGORY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you quarrel, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ABRAHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Quarrel sir! no, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAMPSON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ABRAHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No better.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAMPSON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREGORY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAMPSON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, better, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ABRAHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You lie.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAMPSON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>They fight</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter BENVOLIO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Part, fools!</LINE>
<LINE>Put up your swords; you know not what you do.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Beats down their swords</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter TYBALT</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYBALT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?</LINE>
<LINE>Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,</LINE>
<LINE>Or manage it to part these men with me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYBALT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,</LINE>
<LINE>As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:</LINE>
<LINE>Have at thee, coward!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>They fight</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray;
then enter Citizens, with clubs</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!</LINE>
<LINE>Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,</LINE>
<LINE>And flourishes his blade in spite of me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MONTAGUE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY MONTAGUE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter PRINCE, with Attendants</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,</LINE>
<LINE>Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--</LINE>
<LINE>Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,</LINE>
<LINE>That quench the fire of your pernicious rage</LINE>
<LINE>With purple fountains issuing from your veins,</LINE>
<LINE>On pain of torture, from those bloody hands</LINE>
<LINE>Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,</LINE>
<LINE>And hear the sentence of your moved prince.</LINE>
<LINE>Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,</LINE>
<LINE>By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,</LINE>
<LINE>Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,</LINE>
<LINE>And made Verona's ancient citizens</LINE>
<LINE>Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,</LINE>
<LINE>To wield old partisans, in hands as old,</LINE>
<LINE>Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:</LINE>
<LINE>If ever you disturb our streets again,</LINE>
<LINE>Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.</LINE>
<LINE>For this time, all the rest depart away:</LINE>
<LINE>You Capulet; shall go along with me:</LINE>
<LINE>And, Montague, come you this afternoon,</LINE>
<LINE>To know our further pleasure in this case,</LINE>
<LINE>To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.</LINE>
<LINE>Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MONTAGUE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?</LINE>
<LINE>Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here were the servants of your adversary,</LINE>
<LINE>And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:</LINE>
<LINE>I drew to part them: in the instant came</LINE>
<LINE>The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,</LINE>
<LINE>Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,</LINE>
<LINE>He swung about his head and cut the winds,</LINE>
<LINE>Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:</LINE>
<LINE>While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,</LINE>
<LINE>Came more and more and fought on part and part,</LINE>
<LINE>Till the prince came, who parted either part.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY MONTAGUE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?</LINE>
<LINE>Right glad I am he was not at this fray.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun</LINE>
<LINE>Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,</LINE>
<LINE>A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;</LINE>
<LINE>Where, underneath the grove of sycamore</LINE>
<LINE>That westward rooteth from the city's side,</LINE>
<LINE>So early walking did I see your son:</LINE>
<LINE>Towards him I made, but he was ware of me</LINE>
<LINE>And stole into the covert of the wood:</LINE>
<LINE>I, measuring his affections by my own,</LINE>
<LINE>That most are busied when they're most alone,</LINE>
<LINE>Pursued my humour not pursuing his,</LINE>
<LINE>And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MONTAGUE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Many a morning hath he there been seen,</LINE>
<LINE>With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.</LINE>
<LINE>Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;</LINE>
<LINE>But all so soon as the all-cheering sun</LINE>
<LINE>Should in the furthest east begin to draw</LINE>
<LINE>The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,</LINE>
<LINE>Away from the light steals home my heavy son,</LINE>
<LINE>And private in his chamber pens himself,</LINE>
<LINE>Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out</LINE>
<LINE>And makes himself an artificial night:</LINE>
<LINE>Black and portentous must this humour prove,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless good counsel may the cause remove.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My noble uncle, do you know the cause?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MONTAGUE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I neither know it nor can learn of him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have you importuned him by any means?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MONTAGUE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Both by myself and many other friends:</LINE>
<LINE>But he, his own affections' counsellor,</LINE>
<LINE>Is to himself--I will not say how true--</LINE>
<LINE>But to himself so secret and so close,</LINE>
<LINE>So far from sounding and discovery,</LINE>
<LINE>As is the bud bit with an envious worm,</LINE>
<LINE>Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,</LINE>
<LINE>Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.</LINE>
<LINE>Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.</LINE>
<LINE>We would as willingly give cure as know.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter ROMEO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;</LINE>
<LINE>I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MONTAGUE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,</LINE>
<LINE>To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good-morrow, cousin.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is the day so young?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But new struck nine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay me! sad hours seem long.</LINE>
<LINE>Was that my father that went hence so fast?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not having that, which, having, makes them short.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In love?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Out--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of love?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Out of her favour, where I am in love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,</LINE>
<LINE>Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,</LINE>
<LINE>Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!</LINE>
<LINE>Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?</LINE>
<LINE>Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.</LINE>
<LINE>Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.</LINE>
<LINE>Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!</LINE>
<LINE>O any thing, of nothing first create!</LINE>
<LINE>O heavy lightness! serious vanity!</LINE>
<LINE>Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!</LINE>
<LINE>Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,</LINE>
<LINE>sick health!</LINE>
<LINE>Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!</LINE>
<LINE>This love feel I, that feel no love in this.</LINE>
<LINE>Dost thou not laugh?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, coz, I rather weep.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good heart, at what?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>At thy good heart's oppression.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, such is love's transgression.</LINE>
<LINE>Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,</LINE>
<LINE>Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest</LINE>
<LINE>With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown</LINE>
<LINE>Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.</LINE>
<LINE>Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;</LINE>
<LINE>Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;</LINE>
<LINE>Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:</LINE>
<LINE>What is it else? a madness most discreet,</LINE>
<LINE>A choking gall and a preserving sweet.</LINE>
<LINE>Farewell, my coz.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Soft! I will go along;</LINE>
<LINE>An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;</LINE>
<LINE>This is not Romeo, he's some other where.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, shall I groan and tell thee?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Groan! why, no.</LINE>
<LINE>But sadly tell me who.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:</LINE>
<LINE>Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!</LINE>
<LINE>In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit</LINE>
<LINE>With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;</LINE>
<LINE>And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,</LINE>
<LINE>From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.</LINE>
<LINE>She will not stay the siege of loving terms,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:</LINE>
<LINE>O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,</LINE>
<LINE>That when she dies with beauty dies her store.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,</LINE>
<LINE>For beauty starved with her severity</LINE>
<LINE>Cuts beauty off from all posterity.</LINE>
<LINE>She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,</LINE>
<LINE>To merit bliss by making me despair:</LINE>
<LINE>She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow</LINE>
<LINE>Do I live dead that live to tell it now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, teach me how I should forget to think.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By giving liberty unto thine eyes;</LINE>
<LINE>Examine other beauties.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis the way</LINE>
<LINE>To call hers exquisite, in question more:</LINE>
<LINE>These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows</LINE>
<LINE>Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;</LINE>
<LINE>He that is strucken blind cannot forget</LINE>
<LINE>The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:</LINE>
<LINE>Show me a mistress that is passing fair,</LINE>
<LINE>What doth her beauty serve, but as a note</LINE>
<LINE>Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?</LINE>
<LINE>Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.</LINE>
<LINE>But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But saying o'er what I have said before:</LINE>
<LINE>My child is yet a stranger in the world;</LINE>
<LINE>She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,</LINE>
<LINE>Let two more summers wither in their pride,</LINE>
<LINE>Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PARIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Younger than she are happy mothers made.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And too soon marr'd are those so early made.</LINE>
<LINE>The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,</LINE>
<LINE>She is the hopeful lady of my earth:</LINE>
<LINE>But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,</LINE>
<LINE>My will to her consent is but a part;</LINE>
<LINE>An she agree, within her scope of choice</LINE>
<LINE>Lies my consent and fair according voice.</LINE>
<LINE>This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,</LINE>
<LINE>Whereto I have invited many a guest,</LINE>
<LINE>Such as I love; and you, among the store,</LINE>
<LINE>One more, most welcome, makes my number more.</LINE>
<LINE>At my poor house look to behold this night</LINE>
<LINE>Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:</LINE>
<LINE>Such comfort as do lusty young men feel</LINE>
<LINE>When well-apparell'd April on the heel</LINE>
<LINE>Of limping winter treads, even such delight</LINE>
<LINE>Among fresh female buds shall you this night</LINE>
<LINE>Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,</LINE>
<LINE>And like her most whose merit most shall be:</LINE>
<LINE>Which on more view, of many mine being one</LINE>
<LINE>May stand in number, though in reckoning none,</LINE>
<LINE>Come, go with me.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To Servant, giving a paper</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Go, sirrah, trudge about</LINE>

</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exeunt CAPULET and PARIS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Servant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Find them out whose names are written here! It is</LINE>
<LINE>written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his</LINE>
<LINE>yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with</LINE>
<LINE>his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am</LINE>
<LINE>sent to find those persons whose names are here</LINE>
<LINE>writ, and can never find what names the writing</LINE>
<LINE>person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,</LINE>
<LINE>I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!</LINE>
<LINE>God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter JULIET</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now! who calls?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your mother.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, I am here.</LINE>
<LINE>What is your will?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,</LINE>
<LINE>We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again;</LINE>
<LINE>I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She's not fourteen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--</LINE>
<LINE>And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--</LINE>
<LINE>She is not fourteen. How long is it now</LINE>
<LINE>To Lammas-tide?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A fortnight and odd days.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Even or odd, of all days in the year,</LINE>
<LINE>Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.</LINE>
<LINE>Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--</LINE>
<LINE>Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;</LINE>
<LINE>She was too good for me: but, as I said,</LINE>
<LINE>On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;</LINE>
<LINE>That shall she, marry; I remember it well.</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;</LINE>
<LINE>And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--</LINE>
<LINE>Of all the days of the year, upon that day:</LINE>
<LINE>For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,</LINE>
<LINE>Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;</LINE>
<LINE>My lord and you were then at Mantua:--</LINE>
<LINE>Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,</LINE>
<LINE>When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple</LINE>
<LINE>Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,</LINE>
<LINE>To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!</LINE>
<LINE>Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,</LINE>
<LINE>To bid me trudge:</LINE>
<LINE>And since that time it is eleven years;</LINE>
<LINE>For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,</LINE>
<LINE>She could have run and waddled all about;</LINE>
<LINE>For even the day before, she broke her brow:</LINE>
<LINE>And then my husband--God be with his soul!</LINE>
<LINE>A' was a merry man--took up the child:</LINE>
<LINE>'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?</LINE>
<LINE>Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;</LINE>
<LINE>Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,</LINE>
<LINE>The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'</LINE>
<LINE>To see, now, how a jest shall come about!</LINE>
<LINE>I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,</LINE>
<LINE>I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;</LINE>
<LINE>And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,</LINE>
<LINE>To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'</LINE>
<LINE>And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow</LINE>
<LINE>A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;</LINE>
<LINE>A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:</LINE>
<LINE>'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?</LINE>
<LINE>Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;</LINE>
<LINE>Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!</LINE>
<LINE>Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:</LINE>
<LINE>An I might live to see thee married once,</LINE>
<LINE>I have my wish.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme</LINE>
<LINE>I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,</LINE>
<LINE>How stands your disposition to be married?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is an honour that I dream not of.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>An honour! were not I thine only nurse,</LINE>
<LINE>I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,</LINE>
<LINE>Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,</LINE>
<LINE>Are made already mothers: by my count,</LINE>
<LINE>I was your mother much upon these years</LINE>
<LINE>That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:</LINE>
<LINE>The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A man, young lady! lady, such a man</LINE>
<LINE>As all the world--why, he's a man of wax.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Verona's summer hath not such a flower.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What say you? can you love the gentleman?</LINE>
<LINE>This night you shall behold him at our feast;</LINE>
<LINE>Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,</LINE>
<LINE>And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;</LINE>
<LINE>Examine every married lineament,</LINE>
<LINE>And see how one another lends content</LINE>
<LINE>And what obscured in this fair volume lies</LINE>
<LINE>Find written in the margent of his eyes.</LINE>
<LINE>This precious book of love, this unbound lover,</LINE>
<LINE>To beautify him, only lacks a cover:</LINE>
<LINE>The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride</LINE>
<LINE>For fair without the fair within to hide:</LINE>
<LINE>That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,</LINE>
<LINE>That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;</LINE>
<LINE>So shall you share all that he doth possess,</LINE>
<LINE>By having him, making yourself no less.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll look to like, if looking liking move:</LINE>
<LINE>But no more deep will I endart mine eye</LINE>
<LINE>Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>Servant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter ROMEO, MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, with five or six
Maskers, Torch-bearers, and others</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?</LINE>
<LINE>Or shall we on without a apology?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The date is out of such prolixity:</LINE>
<LINE>We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,</LINE>
<LINE>Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,</LINE>
<LINE>Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke</LINE>
<LINE>After the prompter, for our entrance:</LINE>
<LINE>But let them measure us by what they will;</LINE>
<LINE>We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;</LINE>
<LINE>Being but heavy, I will bear the light.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes</LINE>
<LINE>With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead</LINE>
<LINE>So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,</LINE>
<LINE>And soar with them above a common bound.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am too sore enpierced with his shaft</LINE>
<LINE>To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:</LINE>
<LINE>Under love's heavy burden do I sink.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And, to sink in it, should you burden love;</LINE>
<LINE>Too great oppression for a tender thing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,</LINE>
<LINE>Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If love be rough with you, be rough with love;</LINE>
<LINE>Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.</LINE>
<LINE>Give me a case to put my visage in:</LINE>
<LINE>A visor for a visor! what care I</LINE>
<LINE>What curious eye doth quote deformities?</LINE>
<LINE>Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,</LINE>
<LINE>But every man betake him to his legs.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A torch for me: let wantons light of heart</LINE>
<LINE>Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,</LINE>
<LINE>For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;</LINE>
<LINE>I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.</LINE>
<LINE>The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:</LINE>
<LINE>If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire</LINE>
<LINE>Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st</LINE>
<LINE>Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, that's not so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I mean, sir, in delay</LINE>
<LINE>We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.</LINE>
<LINE>Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits</LINE>
<LINE>Five times in that ere once in our five wits.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And we mean well in going to this mask;</LINE>
<LINE>But 'tis no wit to go.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, may one ask?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I dream'd a dream to-night.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so did I.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, what was yours?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That dreamers often lie.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.</LINE>
<LINE>She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes</LINE>
<LINE>In shape no bigger than an agate-stone</LINE>
<LINE>On the fore-finger of an alderman,</LINE>
<LINE>Drawn with a team of little atomies</LINE>
<LINE>Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;</LINE>
<LINE>Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,</LINE>
<LINE>The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,</LINE>
<LINE>The traces of the smallest spider's web,</LINE>
<LINE>The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,</LINE>
<LINE>Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,</LINE>
<LINE>Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,</LINE>
<LINE>Not so big as a round little worm</LINE>
<LINE>Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;</LINE>
<LINE>Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut</LINE>
<LINE>Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,</LINE>
<LINE>Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.</LINE>
<LINE>And in this state she gallops night by night</LINE>
<LINE>Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;</LINE>
<LINE>O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,</LINE>
<LINE>O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,</LINE>
<LINE>O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,</LINE>
<LINE>Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,</LINE>
<LINE>Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:</LINE>
<LINE>Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,</LINE>
<LINE>And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;</LINE>
<LINE>And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail</LINE>
<LINE>Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,</LINE>
<LINE>Then dreams, he of another benefice:</LINE>
<LINE>Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,</LINE>
<LINE>And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,</LINE>
<LINE>Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,</LINE>
<LINE>Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon</LINE>
<LINE>Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,</LINE>
<LINE>And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two</LINE>
<LINE>And sleeps again. This is that very Mab</LINE>
<LINE>That plats the manes of horses in the night,</LINE>
<LINE>And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,</LINE>
<LINE>Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:</LINE>
<LINE>This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,</LINE>
<LINE>That presses them and learns them first to bear,</LINE>
<LINE>Making them women of good carriage:</LINE>
<LINE>This is she--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!</LINE>
<LINE>Thou talk'st of nothing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>True, I talk of dreams,</LINE>
<LINE>Which are the children of an idle brain,</LINE>
<LINE>Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,</LINE>
<LINE>Which is as thin of substance as the air</LINE>
<LINE>And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes</LINE>
<LINE>Even now the frozen bosom of the north,</LINE>
<LINE>And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,</LINE>
<LINE>Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;</LINE>
<LINE>Supper is done, and we shall come too late.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>

<LINE>She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?</LINE>
<LINE>Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day</LINE>
<LINE>That I have worn a visor and could tell</LINE>
<LINE>A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,</LINE>
<LINE>Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:</LINE>
<LINE>You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.</LINE>
<LINE>A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Music plays, and they dance</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,</LINE>
<LINE>And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.</LINE>
<LINE>Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.</LINE>
<LINE>Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;</LINE>
<LINE>For you and I are past our dancing days:</LINE>

<LINE>Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.</LINE>

<LINE>I know not, sir.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!</LINE>
<LINE>It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night</LINE>
<LINE>Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;</LINE>
<LINE>Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!</LINE>
<LINE>So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,</LINE>
<LINE>As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.</LINE>
<LINE>The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,</LINE>
<LINE>And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.</LINE>
<LINE>Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!</LINE>
<LINE>For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYBALT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This, by his voice, should be a Montague.</LINE>
<LINE>Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave</LINE>

<LINE>To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?</LINE>
<LINE>Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,</LINE>
<LINE>To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.</LINE>

<LINE>Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;</LINE>
<LINE>He bears him like a portly gentleman;</LINE>
<LINE>And, to say truth, Verona brags of him</LINE>
<LINE>To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:</LINE>
<LINE>I would not for the wealth of all the town</LINE>
<LINE>Here in my house do him disparagement:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore be patient, take no note of him:</LINE>
<LINE>It is my will, the which if thou respect,</LINE>
<LINE>Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,</LINE>
<LINE>And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYBALT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It fits, when such a villain is a guest:</LINE>
<LINE>I'll not endure him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He shall be endured:</LINE>
<LINE>What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;</LINE>
<LINE>Am I the master here, or you? go to.</LINE>
<LINE>You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!</LINE>
<LINE>You'll make a mutiny among my guests!</LINE>
<LINE>You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYBALT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go to, go to;</LINE>
<LINE>You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?</LINE>
<LINE>This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:</LINE>
<LINE>You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.</LINE>
<LINE>Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:</LINE>
<LINE>Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame!</LINE>
<LINE>I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYBALT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,</LINE>
<LINE>Which mannerly devotion shows in this;</LINE>
<LINE>For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,</LINE>
<LINE>And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,</LINE>
<LINE>Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,</LINE>
<LINE>But to his foe supposed he must complain,</LINE>
<LINE>And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:</LINE>
<LINE>Being held a foe, he may not have access</LINE>
<LINE>To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;</LINE>
<LINE>And she as much in love, her means much less</LINE>
<LINE>To meet her new-beloved any where:</LINE>

<LINE>Romeo! my cousin Romeo!</LINE>

<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:</LINE>
<LINE>Call, good Mercutio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, I'll conjure too.</LINE>
<LINE>Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!</LINE>
<LINE>Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:</LINE>
<LINE>Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;</LINE>
<LINE>Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'</LINE>
<LINE>Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,</LINE>
<LINE>One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,</LINE>
<LINE>Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,</LINE>
<LINE>When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!</LINE>
<LINE>He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;</LINE>
<LINE>The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.</LINE>
<LINE>I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,</LINE>
<LINE>By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh</LINE>
<LINE>And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,</LINE>
<LINE>That in thy likeness thou appear to us!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him</LINE>
<LINE>To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle</LINE>
<LINE>Of some strange nature, letting it there stand</LINE>
<LINE>Till she had laid it and conjured it down;</LINE>
<LINE>That were some spite: my invocation</LINE>
<LINE>Is fair and honest, and in his mistress' name</LINE>
<LINE>I conjure only but to raise up him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,</LINE>
<LINE>To be consorted with the humorous night:</LINE>
<LINE>Blind is his love and best befits the dark.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.</LINE>
<LINE>Now will he sit under a medlar tree,</LINE>
<LINE>And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit</LINE>
<LINE>As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.</LINE>
<LINE>Romeo, that she were, O, that she were</LINE>
<LINE>An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!</LINE>
<LINE>Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>JULIET appears above at a window</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?</LINE>
<LINE>It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.</LINE>
<LINE>Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,</LINE>
<LINE>Who is already sick and pale with grief,</LINE>
<LINE>That thou her maid art far more fair than she:</LINE>
<LINE>Be not her maid, since she is envious;</LINE>
<LINE>Her vestal livery is but sick and green</LINE>
<LINE>And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.</LINE>
<LINE>It is my lady, O, it is my love!</LINE>
<LINE>O, that she knew she were!</LINE>
<LINE>She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?</LINE>
<LINE>Her eye discourses; I will answer it.</LINE>
<LINE>I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:</LINE>
<LINE>Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>Having some business, do entreat her eyes</LINE>
<LINE>To twinkle in their spheres till they return.</LINE>
<LINE>What if her eyes were there, they in her head?</LINE>
<LINE>The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,</LINE>
<LINE>As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven</LINE>
<LINE>Would through the airy region stream so bright</LINE>
<LINE>That birds would sing and think it were not night.</LINE>
<LINE>See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!</LINE>
<LINE>O, that I were a glove upon that hand,</LINE>

<LINE>As glorious to this night, being o'er my head</LINE>
<LINE>As is a winged messenger of heaven</LINE>
<LINE>Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes</LINE>
<LINE>Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him</LINE>
<LINE>When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds</LINE>
<LINE>And sails upon the bosom of the air.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?</LINE>
<LINE>Deny thy father and refuse thy name;</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.</LINE>
<LINE>What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part</LINE>
<LINE>Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!</LINE>
<LINE>What's in a name? that which we call a rose</LINE>
<LINE>By any other name would smell as sweet;</LINE>
<LINE>So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Retain that dear perfection which he owes</LINE>
<LINE>Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,</LINE>
<LINE>And for that name which is no part of thee</LINE>
<LINE>Take all myself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I take thee at thy word:</LINE>

<LINE>So stumblest on my counsel?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By a name</LINE>
<LINE>I know not how to tell thee who I am:</LINE>
<LINE>My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,</LINE>
<LINE>Because it is an enemy to thee;</LINE>
<LINE>Had I it written, I would tear the word.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?</LINE>
<LINE>The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,</LINE>
<LINE>And the place death, considering who thou art,</LINE>
<LINE>If any of my kinsmen find thee here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;</LINE>
<LINE>For stony limits cannot hold love out,</LINE>
<LINE>And what love can do that dares love attempt;</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If they do see thee, they will murder thee.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By whose direction found'st thou out this place?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;</LINE>
<LINE>He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.</LINE>
<LINE>I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far</LINE>
<LINE>As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,</LINE>

<LINE>Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny</LINE>
<LINE>What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!</LINE>
<LINE>Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'</LINE>
<LINE>And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries</LINE>
<LINE>Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,</LINE>
<LINE>If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:</LINE>
<LINE>Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,</LINE>
<LINE>So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.</LINE>
<LINE>In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:</LINE>
<LINE>But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true</LINE>
<LINE>Than those that have more cunning to be strange.</LINE>
<LINE>I should have been more strange, I must confess,</LINE>
<LINE>But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,</LINE>
<LINE>My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,</LINE>
<LINE>And not impute this yielding to light love,</LINE>
<LINE>Which the dark night hath so discovered.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear</LINE>
<LINE>That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,</LINE>
<LINE>That monthly changes in her circled orb,</LINE>
<LINE>Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What shall I swear by?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do not swear at all;</LINE>
<LINE>Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,</LINE>
<LINE>Which is the god of my idolatry,</LINE>
<LINE>And I'll believe thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If my heart's dear love--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,</LINE>
<LINE>I have no joy of this contract to-night:</LINE>
<LINE>It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;</LINE>
<LINE>Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be</LINE>
<LINE>Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!</LINE>
<LINE>This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,</LINE>
<LINE>May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.</LINE>
<LINE>Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest</LINE>
<LINE>Come to thy heart as that within my breast!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:</LINE>
<LINE>And yet I would it were to give again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But to be frank, and give it thee again.</LINE>
<LINE>And yet I wish but for the thing I have:</LINE>
<LINE>My bounty is as boundless as the sea,</LINE>
<LINE>My love as deep; the more I give to thee,</LINE>
<LINE>The more I have, for both are infinite.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Nurse calls within</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>Enter FRIAR LAURENCE, with a basket</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,</LINE>
<LINE>Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,</LINE>
<LINE>And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels</LINE>
<LINE>From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:</LINE>
<LINE>Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,</LINE>
<LINE>The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,</LINE>
<LINE>I must up-fill this osier cage of ours</LINE>
<LINE>With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.</LINE>
<LINE>The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;</LINE>
<LINE>What is her burying grave that is her womb,</LINE>
<LINE>And from her womb children of divers kind</LINE>
<LINE>We sucking on her natural bosom find,</LINE>
<LINE>Many for many virtues excellent,</LINE>
<LINE>None but for some and yet all different.</LINE>
<LINE>O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies</LINE>
<LINE>In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:</LINE>
<LINE>For nought so vile that on the earth doth live</LINE>
<LINE>But to the earth some special good doth give,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use</LINE>
<LINE>Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:</LINE>
<LINE>Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;</LINE>
<LINE>And vice sometimes by action dignified.</LINE>
<LINE>Within the infant rind of this small flower</LINE>
<LINE>Poison hath residence and medicine power:</LINE>
<LINE>For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;</LINE>
<LINE>Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.</LINE>
<LINE>Two such opposed kings encamp them still</LINE>
<LINE>In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;</LINE>
<LINE>And where the worser is predominant,</LINE>
<LINE>Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good morrow, father.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Benedicite!</LINE>
<LINE>What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?</LINE>
<LINE>Young son, it argues a distemper'd head</LINE>
<LINE>So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:</LINE>
<LINE>Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,</LINE>
<LINE>And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;</LINE>
<LINE>But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain</LINE>
<LINE>Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore thy earliness doth me assure</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;</LINE>
<LINE>Or if not so, then here I hit it right,</LINE>
<LINE>Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;</LINE>
<LINE>I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.</LINE>
<LINE>I have been feasting with mine enemy,</LINE>
<LINE>Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,</LINE>
<LINE>That's by me wounded: both our remedies</LINE>
<LINE>Within thy help and holy physic lies:</LINE>
<LINE>I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,</LINE>
<LINE>My intercession likewise steads my foe.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;</LINE>
<LINE>Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set</LINE>
<LINE>On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:</LINE>
<LINE>As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;</LINE>
<LINE>And all combined, save what thou must combine</LINE>
<LINE>By holy marriage: when and where and how</LINE>
<LINE>We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,</LINE>
<LINE>That thou consent to marry us to-day.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!</LINE>
<LINE>Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,</LINE>
<LINE>So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies</LINE>
<LINE>Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.</LINE>
<LINE>Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine</LINE>
<LINE>Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!</LINE>
<LINE>How much salt water thrown away in waste,</LINE>
<LINE>To season love, that of it doth not taste!</LINE>
<LINE>The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;</LINE>
<LINE>Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit</LINE>
<LINE>Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:</LINE>
<LINE>If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:</LINE>
<LINE>And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,</LINE>
<LINE>Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And bad'st me bury love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not in a grave,</LINE>
<LINE>To lay one in, another out to have.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now</LINE>
<LINE>Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;</LINE>
<LINE>The other did not so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, she knew well</LINE>
<LINE>Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.</LINE>
<LINE>But come, young waverer, come, go with me,</LINE>
<LINE>In one respect I'll thy assistant be;</LINE>
<LINE>For this alliance may so happy prove,</LINE>
<LINE>To turn your households' rancour to pure love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.</LINE>

<LINE>Where the devil should this Romeo be?</LINE>
<LINE>Came he not home to-night?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.</LINE>
<LINE>Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath sent a letter to his father's house.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A challenge, on my life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Romeo will answer it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Any man that can write may answer a letter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he</LINE>
<LINE>dares, being dared.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a</LINE>
<LINE>white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a</LINE>
<LINE>love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the</LINE>
<LINE>blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to</LINE>
<LINE>encounter Tybalt?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, what is Tybalt?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is</LINE>
<LINE>the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as</LINE>
<LINE>you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and</LINE>
<LINE>proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and</LINE>
<LINE>the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk</LINE>
<LINE>button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the</LINE>
<LINE>very first house, of the first and second cause:</LINE>
<LINE>ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the</LINE>
<LINE>hai!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The what?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting</LINE>
<LINE>fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,</LINE>
<LINE>a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good</LINE>
<LINE>whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,</LINE>
<LINE>grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with</LINE>
<LINE>these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these</LINE>
<LINE>perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,</LINE>
<LINE>that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,</LINE>
<LINE>how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers</LINE>
<LINE>that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a</LINE>
<LINE>kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to</LINE>
<LINE>be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;</LINE>
<LINE>Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey</LINE>
<LINE>eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior</LINE>
<LINE>Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation</LINE>
<LINE>to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit</LINE>
<LINE>fairly last night.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in</LINE>
<LINE>such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That's as much as to say, such a case as yours</LINE>
<LINE>constrains a man to bow in the hams.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Meaning, to court'sy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou hast most kindly hit it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A most courteous exposition.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast</LINE>
<LINE>worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it</LINE>
<LINE>is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O single-soled jest, solely singular for the</LINE>
<LINE>singleness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have</LINE>
<LINE>done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of</LINE>
<LINE>thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:</LINE>
<LINE>was I with you there for the goose?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast</LINE>
<LINE>not there for the goose.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, good goose, bite not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most</LINE>
<LINE>sharp sauce.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an</LINE>
<LINE>inch narrow to an ell broad!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added</LINE>
<LINE>to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?</LINE>
<LINE>now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art</LINE>
<LINE>thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:</LINE>
<LINE>for this drivelling love is like a great natural,</LINE>
<LINE>that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stop there, stop there.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when</LINE>

<LINE>An old hare hoar,</LINE>
<LINE>And an old hare hoar,</LINE>
<LINE>Is very good meat in lent</LINE>
<LINE>But a hare that is hoar</LINE>

<LINE>merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him</LINE>
<LINE>down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such</LINE>
<LINE>Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.</LINE>
<LINE>Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am</LINE>
<LINE>none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by</LINE>
<LINE>too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon</LINE>
<LINE>should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare</LINE>
<LINE>draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a</LINE>
<LINE>good quarrel, and the law on my side.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about</LINE>
<LINE>me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:</LINE>
<LINE>and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you</LINE>
<LINE>out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:</LINE>
<LINE>but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into</LINE>
<LINE>a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross</LINE>
<LINE>kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman</LINE>
<LINE>is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double</LINE>
<LINE>with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered</LINE>
<LINE>to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I</LINE>
<LINE>protest unto thee--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much:</LINE>
<LINE>Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as</LINE>
<LINE>I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bid her devise</LINE>
<LINE>Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;</LINE>
<LINE>And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell</LINE>

<LINE>And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:</LINE>
<LINE>Within this hour my man shall be with thee</LINE>
<LINE>And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;</LINE>
<LINE>Which to the high top-gallant of my joy</LINE>
<LINE>Must be my convoy in the secret night.</LINE>
<LINE>Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:</LINE>

<LINE>Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--O, there</LINE>
<LINE>is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain</LINE>
<LINE>lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief</LINE>
<LINE>see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her</LINE>
<LINE>sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer</LINE>
<LINE>man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks</LINE>
<LINE>as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not</LINE>
<LINE>rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for</LINE>
<LINE>the--No; I know it begins with some other</LINE>

<LINE>it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good</LINE>
<LINE>to hear it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>In half an hour she promised to return.</LINE>

<LINE>O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,</LINE>
<LINE>Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,</LINE>
<LINE>Driving back shadows over louring hills:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.</LINE>
<LINE>Now is the sun upon the highmost hill</LINE>
<LINE>Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve</LINE>
<LINE>Is three long hours, yet she is not come.</LINE>
<LINE>Had she affections and warm youthful blood,</LINE>
<LINE>She would be as swift in motion as a ball;</LINE>
<LINE>My words would bandy her to my sweet love,</LINE>
<LINE>And his to me:</LINE>

<LINE>Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;</LINE>
<LINE>If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news</LINE>
<LINE>By playing it to me with so sour a face.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:</LINE>

<LINE>How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath</LINE>

<LINE>Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;</LINE>
<LINE>Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:</LINE>
<LINE>Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not</LINE>
<LINE>how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his</LINE>
<LINE>face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels</LINE>
<LINE>all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,</LINE>
<LINE>though they be not to be talked on, yet they are</LINE>
<LINE>past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,</LINE>
<LINE>but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy</LINE>

<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,</LINE>
<LINE>It cannot countervail the exchange of joy</LINE>
<LINE>That one short minute gives me in her sight:</LINE>
<LINE>Do thou but close our hands with holy words,</LINE>
<LINE>Then love-devouring death do what he dare;</LINE>
<LINE>It is enough I may but call her mine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These violent delights have violent ends</LINE>
<LINE>And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,</LINE>
<LINE>Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey</LINE>
<LINE>Is loathsome in his own deliciousness</LINE>
<LINE>And in the taste confounds the appetite:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;</LINE>
<LINE>Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter JULIET</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot</LINE>
<LINE>Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:</LINE>

<LINE>Thou art like one of those fellows that when he</LINE>

<LINE>Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of</LINE>
<LINE>meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as</LINE>
<LINE>an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a</LINE>
<LINE>man for coughing in the street, because he hath</LINE>
<LINE>wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:</LINE>
<LINE>didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing</LINE>
<LINE>his new doublet before Easter? with another, for</LINE>
<LINE>tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou</LINE>
<LINE>wilt tutor me from quarrelling!</LINE>

<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee</LINE>

<LINE>To such a greeting: villain am I none;</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.</LINE>

<LINE>I do protest, I never injured thee,</LINE>

<LINE>Where are the vile beginners of this fray?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O noble prince, I can discover all</LINE>
<LINE>The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:</LINE>
<LINE>There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,</LINE>
<LINE>That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!</LINE>
<LINE>O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt</LINE>
<LINE>O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,</LINE>
<LINE>For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.</LINE>
<LINE>O cousin, cousin!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;</LINE>
<LINE>Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink</LINE>
<LINE>How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal</LINE>
<LINE>Your high displeasure: all this uttered</LINE>
<LINE>With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Could not take truce with the unruly spleen</LINE>
<LINE>Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts</LINE>
<LINE>With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,</LINE>
<LINE>Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,</LINE>
<LINE>And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats</LINE>
<LINE>Cold death aside, and with the other sends</LINE>
<LINE>It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,</LINE>
<LINE>Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,</LINE>
<LINE>'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than</LINE>
<LINE>his tongue,</LINE>
<LINE>His agile arm beats down their fatal points,</LINE>
<LINE>And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm</LINE>
<LINE>An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life</LINE>
<LINE>Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;</LINE>
<LINE>But by and by comes back to Romeo,</LINE>
<LINE>Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,</LINE>
<LINE>And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I</LINE>
<LINE>Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.</LINE>
<LINE>And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.</LINE>
<LINE>This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is a kinsman to the Montague;</LINE>
<LINE>Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:</LINE>
<LINE>Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,</LINE>
<LINE>And all those twenty could but kill one life.</LINE>
<LINE>I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;</LINE>
<LINE>Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;</LINE>
<LINE>Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MONTAGUE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;</LINE>
<LINE>His fault concludes but what the law should end,</LINE>
<LINE>The life of Tybalt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And for that offence</LINE>
<LINE>Immediately we do exile him hence:</LINE>
<LINE>I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,</LINE>
<LINE>My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;</LINE>
<LINE>But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine</LINE>
<LINE>That you shall all repent the loss of mine:</LINE>
<LINE>I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,</LINE>
<LINE>Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.</LINE>
<LINE>Bear hence this body and attend our will:</LINE>
<LINE>Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.</LINE>

<LINE>And bring in cloudy night immediately.</LINE>
<LINE>Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,</LINE>
<LINE>That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo</LINE>
<LINE>Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.</LINE>
<LINE>Lovers can see to do their amorous rites</LINE>
<LINE>By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,</LINE>
<LINE>It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,</LINE>
<LINE>And learn me how to lose a winning match,</LINE>
<LINE>Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:</LINE>
<LINE>Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,</LINE>
<LINE>With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,</LINE>
<LINE>Think true love acted simple modesty.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;</LINE>
<LINE>For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night</LINE>
<LINE>Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,</LINE>
<LINE>Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,</LINE>
<LINE>Take him and cut him out in little stars,</LINE>
<LINE>And he will make the face of heaven so fine</LINE>
<LINE>That all the world will be in love with night</LINE>
<LINE>And pay no worship to the garish sun.</LINE>
<LINE>O, I have bought the mansion of a love,</LINE>
<LINE>But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,</LINE>
<LINE>Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day</LINE>
<LINE>As is the night before some festival</LINE>
<LINE>To an impatient child that hath new robes</LINE>
<LINE>And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,</LINE>
<LINE>And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks</LINE>

<LINE>What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?</LINE>
<LINE>This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.</LINE>

<LINE>I am not I, if there be such an I;</LINE>
<LINE>Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'</LINE>
<LINE>If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:</LINE>

<LINE>Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,</LINE>

<LINE>Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,</LINE>
<LINE>When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?</LINE>
<LINE>But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?</LINE>
<LINE>That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:</LINE>
<LINE>Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;</LINE>
<LINE>Your tributary drops belong to woe,</LINE>
<LINE>Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.</LINE>
<LINE>My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;</LINE>
<LINE>And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:</LINE>
<LINE>All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?</LINE>
<LINE>Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,</LINE>
<LINE>That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;</LINE>
<LINE>But, O, it presses to my memory,</LINE>
<LINE>Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:</LINE>
<LINE>'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'</LINE>
<LINE>That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'</LINE>
<LINE>Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death</LINE>
<LINE>Was woe enough, if it had ended there:</LINE>
<LINE>Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship</LINE>
<LINE>And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,</LINE>
<LINE>Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'</LINE>
<LINE>Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,</LINE>
<LINE>Which modern lamentations might have moved?</LINE>
<LINE>But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,</LINE>
<LINE>'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,</LINE>
<LINE>Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,</LINE>
<LINE>All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'</LINE>
<LINE>There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,</LINE>
<LINE>In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.</LINE>

<LINE>More honourable state, more courtship lives</LINE>
<LINE>In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize</LINE>
<LINE>On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand</LINE>
<LINE>And steal immortal blessing from her lips,</LINE>
<LINE>Who even in pure and vestal modesty,</LINE>
<LINE>Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;</LINE>
<LINE>But Romeo may not; he is banished:</LINE>
<LINE>Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:</LINE>
<LINE>They are free men, but I am banished.</LINE>
<LINE>And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?</LINE>
<LINE>Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,</LINE>
<LINE>No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,</LINE>
<LINE>But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?</LINE>
<LINE>O friar, the damned use that word in hell;</LINE>
<LINE>Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,</LINE>
<LINE>Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,</LINE>
<LINE>A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,</LINE>
<LINE>To mangle me with that word 'banished'?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:</LINE>
<LINE>Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,</LINE>
<LINE>To comfort thee, though thou art banished.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!</LINE>
<LINE>Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,</LINE>
<LINE>Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,</LINE>
<LINE>It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, then I see that madmen have no ears.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:</LINE>
<LINE>Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,</LINE>
<LINE>An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,</LINE>
<LINE>Doting like me and like me banished,</LINE>
<LINE>Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,</LINE>
<LINE>And fall upon the ground, as I do now,</LINE>
<LINE>Taking the measure of an unmade grave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Knocking within</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,</LINE>
<LINE>Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Knocking</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;</LINE>
<LINE>Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Knocking</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Run to my study. By and by! God's will,</LINE>
<LINE>What simpleness is this! I come, I come!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Knocking</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Within</STAGEDIR>  Let me come in, and you shall know</LINE>
<LINE>my errand;</LINE>
<LINE>I come from Lady Juliet.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Welcome, then.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter Nurse</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,</LINE>
<LINE>Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, he is even in my mistress' case,</LINE>
<LINE>Just in her case! O woful sympathy!</LINE>
<LINE>Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,</LINE>
<LINE>Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.</LINE>
<LINE>Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:</LINE>
<LINE>For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;</LINE>
<LINE>Why should you fall into so deep an O?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nurse!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?</LINE>
<LINE>Doth she not think me an old murderer,</LINE>
<LINE>Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy</LINE>
<LINE>With blood removed but little from her own?</LINE>
<LINE>Where is she? and how doth she? and what says</LINE>
<LINE>My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;</LINE>
<LINE>And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,</LINE>
<LINE>And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,</LINE>
<LINE>And then down falls again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As if that name,</LINE>
<LINE>Shot from the deadly level of a gun,</LINE>
<LINE>Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand</LINE>
<LINE>Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,</LINE>
<LINE>In what vile part of this anatomy</LINE>
<LINE>Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack</LINE>
<LINE>The hateful mansion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Drawing his sword</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hold thy desperate hand:</LINE>
<LINE>Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:</LINE>
<LINE>Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote</LINE>
<LINE>The unreasonable fury of a beast:</LINE>
<LINE>Unseemly woman in a seeming man!</LINE>
<LINE>Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,</LINE>
<LINE>I thought thy disposition better temper'd.</LINE>
<LINE>Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?</LINE>
<LINE>And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,</LINE>
<LINE>By doing damned hate upon thyself?</LINE>
<LINE>Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?</LINE>
<LINE>Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet</LINE>
<LINE>In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.</LINE>
<LINE>Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;</LINE>
<LINE>Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,</LINE>
<LINE>And usest none in that true use indeed</LINE>
<LINE>Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:</LINE>
<LINE>Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,</LINE>
<LINE>Digressing from the valour of a man;</LINE>
<LINE>Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,</LINE>
<LINE>Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;</LINE>
<LINE>Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,</LINE>
<LINE>Misshapen in the conduct of them both,</LINE>
<LINE>Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,</LINE>
<LINE>Is set afire by thine own ignorance,</LINE>
<LINE>And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.</LINE>
<LINE>What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,</LINE>
<LINE>For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;</LINE>
<LINE>There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,</LINE>
<LINE>But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:</LINE>
<LINE>The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend</LINE>
<LINE>And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:</LINE>
<LINE>A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;</LINE>
<LINE>Happiness courts thee in her best array;</LINE>
<LINE>But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:</LINE>
<LINE>Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.</LINE>
<LINE>Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,</LINE>
<LINE>Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:</LINE>
<LINE>But look thou stay not till the watch be set,</LINE>
<LINE>For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;</LINE>
<LINE>Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time</LINE>
<LINE>To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,</LINE>
<LINE>Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back</LINE>
<LINE>With twenty hundred thousand times more joy</LINE>
<LINE>Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.</LINE>
<LINE>Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;</LINE>
<LINE>And bid her hasten all the house to bed,</LINE>
<LINE>Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:</LINE>
<LINE>Romeo is coming.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night</LINE>
<LINE>To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!</LINE>
<LINE>My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:</LINE>
<LINE>Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How well my comfort is revived by this!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:</LINE>
<LINE>Either be gone before the watch be set,</LINE>
<LINE>Or by the break of day disguised from hence:</LINE>
<LINE>Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,</LINE>
<LINE>And he shall signify from time to time</LINE>
<LINE>Every good hap to you that chances here:</LINE>
<LINE>Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But that a joy past joy calls out on me,</LINE>
<LINE>It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and PARIS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,</LINE>
<LINE>That we have had no time to move our daughter:</LINE>
<LINE>Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,</LINE>
<LINE>And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:</LINE>
<LINE>I promise you, but for your company,</LINE>
<LINE>I would have been a-bed an hour ago.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PARIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These times of woe afford no time to woo.</LINE>
<LINE>Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;</LINE>
<LINE>To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender</LINE>
<LINE>Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled</LINE>
<LINE>In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.</LINE>
<LINE>Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;</LINE>
<LINE>Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;</LINE>
<LINE>And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--</LINE>
<LINE>But, soft! what day is this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PARIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Monday, my lord,</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,</LINE>
<LINE>O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,</LINE>
<LINE>She shall be married to this noble earl.</LINE>
<LINE>Will you be ready? do you like this haste?</LINE>
<LINE>We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;</LINE>
<LINE>For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,</LINE>
<LINE>It may be thought we held him carelessly,</LINE>
<LINE>Being our kinsman, if we revel much:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,</LINE>
<LINE>And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PARIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.</LINE>
<LINE>Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,</LINE>
<LINE>Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.</LINE>
<LINE>Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!</LINE>
<LINE>Afore me! it is so very very late,</LINE>
<LINE>That we may call it early by and by.</LINE>
<LINE>Good night.</LINE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE V.  Capulet's orchard.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter ROMEO and JULIET above, at the window</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:</LINE>
<LINE>It was the nightingale, and not the lark,</LINE>
<LINE>That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;</LINE>
<LINE>Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:</LINE>
<LINE>Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It was the lark, the herald of the morn,</LINE>
<LINE>No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks</LINE>
<LINE>Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:</LINE>
<LINE>Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day</LINE>
<LINE>Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.</LINE>
<LINE>I must be gone and live, or stay and die.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:</LINE>
<LINE>It is some meteor that the sun exhales,</LINE>
<LINE>To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,</LINE>
<LINE>And light thee on thy way to Mantua:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;</LINE>
<LINE>I am content, so thou wilt have it so.</LINE>
<LINE>I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat</LINE>
<LINE>The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:</LINE>
<LINE>I have more care to stay than will to go:</LINE>
<LINE>Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.</LINE>
<LINE>How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!</LINE>
<LINE>It is the lark that sings so out of tune,</LINE>
<LINE>Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.</LINE>
<LINE>Some say the lark makes sweet division;</LINE>
<LINE>This doth not so, for she divideth us:</LINE>
<LINE>Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>O, now I would they had changed voices too!</LINE>
<LINE>Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,</LINE>
<LINE>Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,</LINE>
<LINE>O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter Nurse, to the chamber</STAGEDIR>

<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then, window, let day in, and let life out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>He goeth down</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!</LINE>
<LINE>I must hear from thee every day in the hour,</LINE>
<LINE>For in a minute there are many days:</LINE>
<LINE>O, by this count I shall be much in years</LINE>
<LINE>Ere I again behold my Romeo!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Farewell!</LINE>
<LINE>I will omit no opportunity</LINE>
<LINE>That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve</LINE>
<LINE>For sweet discourses in our time to come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O God, I have an ill-divining soul!</LINE>
<LINE>Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,</LINE>
<LINE>As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:</LINE>
<LINE>Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:</LINE>
<LINE>Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:</LINE>
<LINE>If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.</LINE>
<LINE>That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;</LINE>
<LINE>For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,</LINE>
<LINE>But send him back.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?</LINE>
<LINE>Is she not down so late, or up so early?</LINE>
<LINE>What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter LADY CAPULET</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, how now, Juliet!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, I am not well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?</LINE>
<LINE>What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?</LINE>
<LINE>An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;</LINE>
<LINE>But much of grief shows still some want of wit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend</LINE>
<LINE>Which you weep for.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Feeling so the loss,</LINE>
<LINE>Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,</LINE>
<LINE>As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What villain madam?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That same villain, Romeo.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  Villain and he be many miles asunder.--</LINE>
<LINE>God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;</LINE>
<LINE>And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That is, because the traitor murderer lives.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:</LINE>
<LINE>Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:</LINE>
<LINE>Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,</LINE>
<LINE>Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,</LINE>
<LINE>That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:</LINE>
<LINE>And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed, I never shall be satisfied</LINE>
<LINE>With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--</LINE>
<LINE>Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.</LINE>
<LINE>Madam, if you could find out but a man</LINE>
<LINE>To bear a poison, I would temper it;</LINE>
<LINE>That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,</LINE>
<LINE>Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors</LINE>
<LINE>To hear him named, and cannot come to him.</LINE>
<LINE>To wreak the love I bore my cousin</LINE>
<LINE>Upon his body that slaughter'd him!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.</LINE>
<LINE>But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And joy comes well in such a needy time:</LINE>
<LINE>What are they, I beseech your ladyship?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;</LINE>
<LINE>One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,</LINE>
<LINE>That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, in happy time, what day is that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,</LINE>
<LINE>The gallant, young and noble gentleman,</LINE>
<LINE>The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,</LINE>
<LINE>He shall not make me there a joyful bride.</LINE>
<LINE>I wonder at this haste; that I must wed</LINE>
<LINE>Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.</LINE>
<LINE>I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,</LINE>
<LINE>I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,</LINE>
<LINE>It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,</LINE>
<LINE>Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,</LINE>
<LINE>And see how he will take it at your hands.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter CAPULET and Nurse</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;</LINE>
<LINE>But for the sunset of my brother's son</LINE>
<LINE>It rains downright.</LINE>
<LINE>How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?</LINE>
<LINE>Evermore showering? In one little body</LINE>
<LINE>Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;</LINE>
<LINE>For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,</LINE>
<LINE>Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,</LINE>
<LINE>Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;</LINE>
<LINE>Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,</LINE>
<LINE>Without a sudden calm, will overset</LINE>
<LINE>Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!</LINE>
<LINE>Have you deliver'd to her our decree?</LINE>

<LINE>Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.</LINE>

<LINE>Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.</LINE>
<LINE>How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?</LINE>
<LINE>Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,</LINE>
<LINE>Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought</LINE>
<LINE>So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:</LINE>
<LINE>Proud can I never be of what I hate;</LINE>
<LINE>But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?</LINE>
<LINE>'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'</LINE>
<LINE>And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,</LINE>
<LINE>Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,</LINE>
<LINE>But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,</LINE>
<LINE>To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,</LINE>

<LINE>Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;</LINE>
<LINE>My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest</LINE>
<LINE>That God had lent us but this only child;</LINE>
<LINE>But now I see this one is one too much,</LINE>

<LINE>A gentleman of noble parentage,</LINE>
<LINE>Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,</LINE>
<LINE>Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;</LINE>
<LINE>And then to have a wretched puling fool,</LINE>

<LINE>I think you are happy in this second match,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PARIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My father Capulet will have it so;</LINE>
<LINE>And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You say you do not know the lady's mind:</LINE>
<LINE>Uneven is the course, I like it not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PARIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore have I little talk'd of love;</LINE>
<LINE>For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.</LINE>
<LINE>Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous</LINE>
<LINE>That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,</LINE>
<LINE>And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,</LINE>
<LINE>To stop the inundation of her tears;</LINE>
<LINE>Which, too much minded by herself alone,</LINE>
<LINE>May be put from her by society:</LINE>
<LINE>Now do you know the reason of this haste.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>PARIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Happily met, my lady and my wife!</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PARIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come you to make confession to this father?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To answer that, I should confess to you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PARIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do not deny to him that you love me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will confess to you that I love him.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PARIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I do so, it will be of more price,</LINE>
<LINE>Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PARIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The tears have got small victory by that;</LINE>
<LINE>For it was bad enough before their spite.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PARIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;</LINE>
<LINE>And what I spake, I spake it to my face.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PARIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It may be so, for it is not mine own.</LINE>
<LINE>Are you at leisure, holy father, now;</LINE>
<LINE>Or shall I come to you at evening mass?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.</LINE>
<LINE>My lord, we must entreat the time alone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PARIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God shield I should disturb devotion!</LINE>
<LINE>Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;</LINE>
<LINE>It strains me past the compass of my wits:</LINE>
<LINE>I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,</LINE>
<LINE>On Thursday next be married to this county.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:</LINE>
<LINE>If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,</LINE>
<LINE>Do thou but call my resolution wise,</LINE>
<LINE>And with this knife I'll help it presently.</LINE>
<LINE>God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;</LINE>
<LINE>And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall be the label to another deed,</LINE>
<LINE>Or my true heart with treacherous revolt</LINE>
<LINE>Turn to another, this shall slay them both:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,</LINE>
<LINE>Give me some present counsel, or, behold,</LINE>
<LINE>'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife</LINE>
<LINE>Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that</LINE>
<LINE>Which the commission of thy years and art</LINE>
<LINE>Could to no issue of true honour bring.</LINE>
<LINE>Be not so long to speak; I long to die,</LINE>
<LINE>If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,</LINE>
<LINE>Which craves as desperate an execution.</LINE>
<LINE>As that is desperate which we would prevent.</LINE>
<LINE>If, rather than to marry County Paris,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,</LINE>
<LINE>Then is it likely thou wilt undertake</LINE>
<LINE>A thing like death to chide away this shame,</LINE>
<LINE>That copest with death himself to scape from it:</LINE>
<LINE>And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,</LINE>
<LINE>From off the battlements of yonder tower;</LINE>
<LINE>Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk</LINE>
<LINE>Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;</LINE>
<LINE>Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,</LINE>
<LINE>O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,</LINE>
<LINE>With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;</LINE>
<LINE>Or bid me go into a new-made grave</LINE>
<LINE>And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;</LINE>
<LINE>Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;</LINE>
<LINE>And I will do it without fear or doubt,</LINE>
<LINE>To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent</LINE>
<LINE>To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:</LINE>
<LINE>To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;</LINE>
<LINE>Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:</LINE>
<LINE>Take thou this vial, being then in bed,</LINE>
<LINE>And this distilled liquor drink thou off;</LINE>
<LINE>When presently through all thy veins shall run</LINE>
<LINE>A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse</LINE>
<LINE>Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:</LINE>
<LINE>No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;</LINE>
<LINE>The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade</LINE>
<LINE>To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,</LINE>
<LINE>Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;</LINE>
<LINE>Each part, deprived of supple government,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:</LINE>
<LINE>And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death</LINE>
<LINE>Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,</LINE>
<LINE>And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.</LINE>
<LINE>Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes</LINE>
<LINE>To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:</LINE>
<LINE>Then, as the manner of our country is,</LINE>
<LINE>In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier</LINE>
<LINE>Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault</LINE>
<LINE>Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.</LINE>
<LINE>In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,</LINE>
<LINE>And hither shall he come: and he and I</LINE>
<LINE>Will watch thy waking, and that very night</LINE>
<LINE>Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.</LINE>
<LINE>And this shall free thee from this present shame;</LINE>
<LINE>If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,</LINE>
<LINE>Abate thy valour in the acting it.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>

<STAGEDIR>Laying down her dagger</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>What if it be a poison, which the friar</LINE>
<LINE>Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,</LINE>
<LINE>Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Because he married me before to Romeo?</LINE>
<LINE>I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,</LINE>
<LINE>For he hath still been tried a holy man.</LINE>
<LINE>How if, when I am laid into the tomb,</LINE>
<LINE>I wake before the time that Romeo</LINE>
<LINE>Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!</LINE>
<LINE>Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,</LINE>
<LINE>To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,</LINE>
<LINE>And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?</LINE>
<LINE>Or, if I live, is it not very like,</LINE>
<LINE>The horrible conceit of death and night,</LINE>
<LINE>Together with the terror of the place,--</LINE>
<LINE>As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,</LINE>
<LINE>Where, for these many hundred years, the bones</LINE>
<LINE>Of all my buried ancestors are packed:</LINE>
<LINE>Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,</LINE>
<LINE>Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,</LINE>
<LINE>At some hours in the night spirits resort;--</LINE>
<LINE>Alack, alack, is it not like that I,</LINE>
<LINE>So early waking, what with loathsome smells,</LINE>
<LINE>And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,</LINE>
<LINE>That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--</LINE>
<LINE>O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,</LINE>
<LINE>Environed with all these hideous fears?</LINE>
<LINE>And madly play with my forefather's joints?</LINE>
<LINE>And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?</LINE>
<LINE>And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,</LINE>
<LINE>As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?</LINE>
<LINE>O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost</LINE>
<LINE>Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body</LINE>
<LINE>Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!</LINE>

<LINE>Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.</LINE>
<LINE>I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--</LINE>
<LINE>Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave</LINE>
<LINE>to think!--</LINE>
<LINE>And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,</LINE>
<LINE>That I revived, and was an emperor.</LINE>

<LINE>I do remember an apothecary,--</LINE>
<LINE>And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted</LINE>
<LINE>In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,</LINE>
<LINE>Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,</LINE>
<LINE>Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:</LINE>
<LINE>And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,</LINE>
<LINE>An alligator stuff'd, and other skins</LINE>
<LINE>Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves</LINE>
<LINE>A beggarly account of empty boxes,</LINE>
<LINE>Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,</LINE>
<LINE>Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,</LINE>
<LINE>Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.</LINE>
<LINE>Noting this penury, to myself I said</LINE>
<LINE>'An if a man did need a poison now,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose sale is present death in Mantua,</LINE>
<LINE>Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'</LINE>
<LINE>O, this same thought did but forerun my need;</LINE>
<LINE>And this same needy man must sell it me.</LINE>
<LINE>As I remember, this should be the house.</LINE>
<LINE>Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.</LINE>

<LINE>Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:</LINE>
<LINE>Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have</LINE>
<LINE>A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear</LINE>
<LINE>As will disperse itself through all the veins</LINE>
<LINE>That the life-weary taker may fall dead</LINE>
<LINE>And that the trunk may be discharged of breath</LINE>

<LINE>And finding him, the searchers of the town,</LINE>
<LINE>Suspecting that we both were in a house</LINE>
<LINE>Where the infectious pestilence did reign,</LINE>
<LINE>Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;</LINE>
<LINE>So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR JOHN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I could not send it,--here it is again,--</LINE>
<LINE>Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,</LINE>
<LINE>So fearful were they of infection.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,</LINE>
<LINE>The letter was not nice but full of charge</LINE>
<LINE>Of dear import, and the neglecting it</LINE>
<LINE>May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;</LINE>
<LINE>Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight</LINE>
<LINE>Unto my cell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR JOHN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now must I to the monument alone;</LINE>
<LINE>Within three hours will fair Juliet wake:</LINE>
<LINE>She will beshrew me much that Romeo</LINE>
<LINE>Hath had no notice of these accidents;</LINE>
<LINE>But I will write again to Mantua,</LINE>
<LINE>And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;</LINE>
<LINE>Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter PARIS, and his Page bearing flowers and a torch</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PARIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:</LINE>
<LINE>Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.</LINE>
<LINE>Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,</LINE>
<LINE>Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;</LINE>
<LINE>So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,</LINE>
<LINE>Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,</LINE>
<LINE>But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,</LINE>
<LINE>As signal that thou hear'st something approach.</LINE>
<LINE>Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  I am almost afraid to stand alone</LINE>
<LINE>Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PARIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,--</LINE>
<LINE>O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--</LINE>
<LINE>Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,</LINE>
<LINE>Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:</LINE>
<LINE>The obsequies that I for thee will keep</LINE>
<LINE>Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>The Page whistles</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>The boy gives warning something doth approach.</LINE>
<LINE>What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,</LINE>
<LINE>To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?</LINE>
<LINE>What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Retires</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter ROMEO and BALTHASAR, with a torch,
mattock, &amp;c</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.</LINE>
<LINE>Hold, take this letter; early in the morning</LINE>
<LINE>See thou deliver it to my lord and father.</LINE>
<LINE>Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,</LINE>
<LINE>Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,</LINE>
<LINE>And do not interrupt me in my course.</LINE>
<LINE>Why I descend into this bed of death,</LINE>
<LINE>Is partly to behold my lady's face;</LINE>
<LINE>But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger</LINE>
<LINE>A precious ring, a ring that I must use</LINE>
<LINE>In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:</LINE>
<LINE>But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry</LINE>
<LINE>In what I further shall intend to do,</LINE>
<LINE>By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint</LINE>
<LINE>And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:</LINE>
<LINE>The time and my intents are savage-wild,</LINE>
<LINE>More fierce and more inexorable far</LINE>
<LINE>Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BALTHASAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:</LINE>
<LINE>Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BALTHASAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout:</LINE>
<LINE>His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Retires</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,</LINE>
<LINE>Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Opens the tomb</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PARIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is that banish'd haughty Montague,</LINE>
<LINE>That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,</LINE>
<LINE>It is supposed, the fair creature died;</LINE>
<LINE>And here is come to do some villanous shame</LINE>
<LINE>To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Comes forward</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!</LINE>
<LINE>Can vengeance be pursued further than death?</LINE>
<LINE>Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:</LINE>
<LINE>Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.</LINE>
<LINE>Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;</LINE>
<LINE>Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone;</LINE>
<LINE>Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,</LINE>
<LINE>Put not another sin upon my head,</LINE>
<LINE>By urging me to fury: O, be gone!</LINE>
<LINE>By heaven, I love thee better than myself;</LINE>
<LINE>For I come hither arm'd against myself:</LINE>
<LINE>Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,</LINE>
<LINE>A madman's mercy bade thee run away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.</LINE>
<LINE>Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!</LINE>
<LINE>What said my man, when my betossed soul</LINE>
<LINE>Did not attend him as we rode? I think</LINE>
<LINE>He told me Paris should have married Juliet:</LINE>
<LINE>Said he not so? or did I dream it so?</LINE>
<LINE>Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,</LINE>
<LINE>To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,</LINE>
<LINE>One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!</LINE>
<LINE>I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;</LINE>
<LINE>A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,</LINE>
<LINE>For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes</LINE>
<LINE>This vault a feasting presence full of light.</LINE>
<LINE>Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Laying PARIS in the tomb</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How oft when men are at the point of death</LINE>
<LINE>Have they been merry! which their keepers call</LINE>
<LINE>A lightning before death: O, how may I</LINE>
<LINE>Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!</LINE>
<LINE>Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet</LINE>
<LINE>Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,</LINE>
<LINE>And death's pale flag is not advanced there.</LINE>
<LINE>Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?</LINE>
<LINE>O, what more favour can I do to thee,</LINE>
<LINE>Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain</LINE>
<LINE>To sunder his that was thine enemy?</LINE>
<LINE>Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,</LINE>
<LINE>Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe</LINE>
<LINE>That unsubstantial death is amorous,</LINE>
<LINE>And that the lean abhorred monster keeps</LINE>
<LINE>Thee here in dark to be his paramour?</LINE>
<LINE>For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;</LINE>
<LINE>And never from this palace of dim night</LINE>
<LINE>Depart again: here, here will I remain</LINE>
<LINE>With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here</LINE>
<LINE>Will I set up my everlasting rest,</LINE>
<LINE>And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars</LINE>
<LINE>From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!</LINE>
<LINE>Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you</LINE>
<LINE>The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss</LINE>
<LINE>A dateless bargain to engrossing death!</LINE>
<LINE>Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!</LINE>
<LINE>Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on</LINE>
<LINE>The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!</LINE>
<LINE>Here's to my love!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Drinks</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>O true apothecary!</LINE>
<LINE>Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.</LINE>

<LINE>Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,</LINE>
<LINE>What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light</LINE>
<LINE>To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,</LINE>
<LINE>It burneth in the Capel's monument.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BALTHASAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BALTHASAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I dare not, sir</LINE>
<LINE>My master knows not but I am gone hence;</LINE>
<LINE>And fearfully did menace me with death,</LINE>
<LINE>If I did stay to look on his intents.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:</LINE>
<LINE>O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BALTHASAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,</LINE>

<LINE>Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains</LINE>

<LINE>To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enters the tomb</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?</LINE>
<LINE>And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour</LINE>
<LINE>Is guilty of this lamentable chance!</LINE>
<LINE>The lady stirs.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>JULIET wakes</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O comfortable friar! where is my lord?</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Noise within</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest</LINE>
<LINE>Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:</LINE>
<LINE>A greater power than we can contradict</LINE>
<LINE>Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.</LINE>
<LINE>Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;</LINE>
<LINE>And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee</LINE>
<LINE>Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:</LINE>
<LINE>Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;</LINE>
<LINE>Come, go, good Juliet,</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Noise again</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I dare no longer stay.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit FRIAR LAURENCE</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?</LINE>
<LINE>Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:</LINE>
<LINE>O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop</LINE>
<LINE>To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;</LINE>
<LINE>Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,</LINE>
<LINE>To make die with a restorative.</LINE>

<LINE>This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Watchman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:</LINE>
<LINE>Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.</LINE>
<LINE>Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,</LINE>
<LINE>And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,</LINE>
<LINE>Who here hath lain these two days buried.</LINE>
<LINE>Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:</LINE>
<LINE>Raise up the Montagues: some others search:</LINE>
<LINE>We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;</LINE>
<LINE>But the true ground of all these piteous woes</LINE>
<LINE>We cannot without circumstance descry.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter others of the Watch, with FRIAR LAURENCE</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Watchman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:</LINE>

<LINE>As he was coming from this churchyard side.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Watchman</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The people in the street cry Romeo,</LINE>
<LINE>Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,</LINE>
<LINE>With open outcry toward our monument.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What fear is this which startles in our ears?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Watchman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;</LINE>
<LINE>And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!</LINE>
<LINE>This dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house</LINE>
<LINE>Is empty on the back of Montague,--</LINE>
<LINE>And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O me! this sight of death is as a bell,</LINE>
<LINE>That warns my old age to a sepulchre.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter MONTAGUE and others</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, Montague; for thou art early up,</LINE>
<LINE>To see thy son and heir more early down.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MONTAGUE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;</LINE>
<LINE>Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:</LINE>

<LINE>Look, and thou shalt see.</LINE>

<LINE>O thou untaught! what manners is in this?</LINE>
<LINE>To press before thy father to a grave?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,</LINE>
<LINE>Till we can clear these ambiguities,</LINE>
<LINE>And know their spring, their head, their</LINE>
<LINE>true descent;</LINE>
<LINE>And then will I be general of your woes,</LINE>
<LINE>And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,</LINE>
<LINE>And let mischance be slave to patience.</LINE>
<LINE>Bring forth the parties of suspicion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am the greatest, able to do least,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet most suspected, as the time and place</LINE>
<LINE>Doth make against me of this direful murder;</LINE>
<LINE>And here I stand, both to impeach and purge</LINE>
<LINE>Myself condemned and myself excused.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then say at once what thou dost know in this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will be brief, for my short date of breath</LINE>
<LINE>Is not so long as is a tedious tale.</LINE>
<LINE>Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;</LINE>
<LINE>And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:</LINE>
<LINE>I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day</LINE>
<LINE>Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death</LINE>
<LINE>Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,</LINE>
<LINE>For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.</LINE>
<LINE>You, to remove that siege of grief from her,</LINE>
<LINE>Betroth'd and would have married her perforce</LINE>
<LINE>To County Paris: then comes she to me,</LINE>
<LINE>And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean</LINE>
<LINE>To rid her from this second marriage,</LINE>
<LINE>Or in my cell there would she kill herself.</LINE>
<LINE>Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,</LINE>
<LINE>A sleeping potion; which so took effect</LINE>
<LINE>As I intended, for it wrought on her</LINE>
<LINE>The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,</LINE>
<LINE>That he should hither come as this dire night,</LINE>
<LINE>To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,</LINE>
<LINE>Being the time the potion's force should cease.</LINE>
<LINE>But he which bore my letter, Friar John,</LINE>
<LINE>Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight</LINE>
<LINE>Return'd my letter back. Then all alone</LINE>
<LINE>At the prefixed hour of her waking,</LINE>
<LINE>Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;</LINE>
<LINE>Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,</LINE>
<LINE>Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:</LINE>
<LINE>But when I came, some minute ere the time</LINE>
<LINE>Of her awaking, here untimely lay</LINE>
<LINE>The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.</LINE>
<LINE>She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,</LINE>
<LINE>And bear this work of heaven with patience:</LINE>
<LINE>But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;</LINE>
<LINE>And she, too desperate, would not go with me,</LINE>
<LINE>But, as it seems, did violence on herself.</LINE>
<LINE>All this I know; and to the marriage</LINE>
<LINE>Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this</LINE>
<LINE>Miscarried by my fault, let my old life</LINE>
<LINE>Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,</LINE>
<LINE>Unto the rigour of severest law.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We still have known thee for a holy man.</LINE>
<LINE>Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BALTHASAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I brought my master news of Juliet's death;</LINE>
<LINE>And then in post he came from Mantua</LINE>
<LINE>To this same place, to this same monument.</LINE>
<LINE>This letter he early bid me give his father,</LINE>
<LINE>And threatened me with death, going in the vault,</LINE>
<LINE>I departed not and left him there.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me the letter; I will look on it.</LINE>
<LINE>Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?</LINE>
<LINE>Sirrah, what made your master in this place?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;</LINE>
<LINE>And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:</LINE>
<LINE>Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;</LINE>
<LINE>And by and by my master drew on him;</LINE>
<LINE>And then I ran away to call the watch.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This letter doth make good the friar's words,</LINE>
<LINE>Their course of love, the tidings of her death:</LINE>
<LINE>And here he writes that he did buy a poison</LINE>
<LINE>Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal</LINE>
<LINE>Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.</LINE>
<LINE>Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!</LINE>
<LINE>See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,</LINE>
<LINE>That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.</LINE>
<LINE>And I for winking at your discords too</LINE>
<LINE>Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O brother Montague, give me thy hand:</LINE>
<LINE>This is my daughter's jointure, for no more</LINE>
<LINE>Can I demand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MONTAGUE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But I can give thee more:</LINE>
<LINE>For I will raise her statue in pure gold;</LINE>
<LINE>That while Verona by that name is known,</LINE>
<LINE>There shall no figure at such rate be set</LINE>
<LINE>As that of true and faithful Juliet.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;</LINE>
<LINE>Poor sacrifices of our enmity!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A glooming peace this morning with it brings;</LINE>
<LINE>The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:</LINE>
<LINE>Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;</LINE>
<LINE>Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:</LINE>
<LINE>For never was a story of more woe</LINE>
<LINE>Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.</LINE>
