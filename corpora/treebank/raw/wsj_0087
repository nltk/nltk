Five things you can do for $15,000 or less: 

1.
Buy a new Chevrolet. 

2.
Take a Hawaiian vacation. 

3.
Send your child to a university. 

4.
Buy a diamond necklace. 

5.
Make a lasting difference in the regulatory life of an American savings-and-loan association through the Foster Corporate Parents Plan. 

Americans today spend $15,000 like pocket change -- they don't think much about it.
But for an ailing savings-and-loan association -- teetering on insolvency -- it can lead to safety from imminent demise and to a future full of promise. 

Your $15,000 will help keep a needy savings and loan solvent -- and out of the federal budget deficit. 

As a Foster Corporate Parent, you'll be helping a neighborhood S&L in areas crucial to its survival.
Like healthy regulatory capital.
A steady deposit base.
Performing loans.
At the same time, you'll give your Foster Savings Institution the gift of hope and freedom from the federal regulators who want to close its doors -- for good. 

As a Foster Corporate Parent, you will experience the same joy felt by Robert Bass, Lewis Ranieri, William Simon and others, who find ways to help troubled savings institutions and their employees help themselves.
That builds confidence, self sufficiency, not to mention critical regulatory net worth. 

Don't wait -- a savings institution needs your help now! 

Every day you delay, a savings institution's health -- and the federal budget deficit -- grows worse.
Think about the good you can do for just $15,000 a month, about the cost of a mid-size Chevrolet or two semesters at a state university.
Then send your support to a savings institution that has taken a bad rap in the press and on its bottom line.
Every $15,000 you send will go a long way to boost sagging net worth and employee morale -- and keep your Foster Savings Institution off the federal budget deficit!
