Furukawa Co. of Japan said it will acquire two construction machinery plants and a sales unit in France formerly belonging to Dresser Industries Inc. of the U.S. 

The company said it made the purchase in order to locally produce hydraulically operated shovels. 

Last October, the company also bought a wheel-loader manufacturing plant in Heidelberg, West Germany, from Dresser. 

Furukawa said the purchase of the French and German plants together will total about 40 billion yen ($280 million).
