<BLOCK>
A.DO NOT use Ecostatin Pessaries during the first three months of pregnancy unless your doctor decides it is necessary for you. If Ecostatin Pessaries are prescribed for you later on in pregnancy check with your doctor before using the applicator. It may be better it you use your fingers to insert the pessary. The cream works on the surface of the skin and is unlikely to be absorbed. However it is best to consult your doctor or pharmacist before using the product.
