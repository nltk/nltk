MORE INFORMATION ABOUT DEPRESSION
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>

<EMPH  weight="bold"  slant = "italic">
Depression is a common illness. At any one time, one in 20 people will be suffering from it. The balance of chemicals in the brain is also thought to affect the way we feel. Serotonin is one of these chemicals, and appears to be at low levels in people who are depressed. For the first week or two after you start taking your tablets, you may still find that things will be difficult. This is because it takes a while for your tablets to rebalance the serotonin in your brain. But, once this starts to happen, you will notice the difference.

It is important that, even when you begin to feel better, you keep taking your tablets until your doctor tells you to stop. This will reduce the chance of your depression returning.
