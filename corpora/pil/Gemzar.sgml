</HEAD>

What is in your medicine?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Your medicine is called Gemzar. Its active ingredient is gemcitabine hydrochloride. Gemzar also contains the inactive ingredients mannitol and sodium acetate.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Your medicine came from a glass bottle supplied to the hospital containing either 200 milligrams or 1 gram of gemcitabine hydrochloride powder.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
A hospital pharmacist, nurse or doctor will have dissolved the Gemzar powder in sterile sodium chloride solution. This liquid is then passed from a bag or pump through a tube and needle into one of your veins. This is called an 'intravenous infusion'.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Gemzar is a 'cytotoxic' drug. Cytotoxic drugs kill cells which are dividing, including cancer cells.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Gemzar is made by Lilly France SA, Rue du Colonel Lilly, 67640 Fegersheim, France. The product licence holder is Eli Lilly and Company Limited, Dextra Court, Chapel Hill, Basingstoke, Hampshire, RG21 5SY

These are some of the things your doctor will have thought about:
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
If you have a long infusion injection (more than 30 minutes) or a lot of infusion injections (more than once a week) it may cause more side effects.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Gemzar and most other cytotoxic drugs may affect the cells in your bone marrow. These cells divide very quickly to make new blood cells. Your doctor or nurse will take samples of your blood when you are treated with Gemzar. The hospital's laboratory will count the number of each different type of blood cell (platelets, white cells and red cells). Your doctor may decide to change the dose or put off treating you if your blood cell counts are too low. Your blood cell counts soon improve as your bone marrow makes new cells.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The laboratory will also check that your liver and kidneys are working normally because they remove Gemzar from the body. If they are not getting rid of it quickly enough your doctor may decide to stop giving you Gemzar.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Do not drive or use dangerous machinery if you feel tired.

The doctor will then inject the right amount of Gemzar solution into a vein over half an hour. This is only done once a week for three weeks (see picture).
