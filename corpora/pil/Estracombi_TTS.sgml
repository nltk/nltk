Putting on a patch
</HEAD>


<LIST type="bulleted">

<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
Remove one sachet from the box and tear it open at the notch.  Use your fingers because cutting with scissors might damage the patch inside.  You must never cut or tear your patches in any way.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
Take out the transparent patch and loosen the backing by rubbing the edge of the patch between your thumb and forefinger.  The stiff protective liner will peel away from the flexible, sticky patch.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
Stick the patch onto a hairless area of skin below the waist.  Most patients find that the buttock is the best place and that skin irritation is less likely to occur at this site.  You could also try the lower back, hip, abdomen or upper thigh
<EMPH weight="bold">
.  Never put a patch on or near the breasts
</EMPH>
.  Choose a clean, dry area of skin. Avoid skin which is red or irritated. Never powder or oil your skin before putting on a patch as it may not stick properly.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
Place the sticky patch on the area of skin you have chosen and press it firmly into position with the palm of your hand.  Pressing for 10-20 seconds or so will make it stick securely.  Run your finger around the edge of the patch to make sure that the edges stick.  Provided that you have applied the patch correctly, you can bath, shower or swim with little risk of the patch coming off.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
If the patch does come off in the bath or shower, just shake it to remove any water, dry the skin thoroughly and put it on again in the usual way.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
When the time comes to change your patch, take off the old one, fold it in half with the sticky side inwards, and throw it away carefully out of the reach of children.  Remember, it will still contain some medication.
</BLOCK>

<EMPH weight="bold">
Always place your new patch on a fresh area of skin.

If you forget to change the patch at the right time, you should change it as soon as possible. Then change to your next patch on the normal day.
