WHY DOES YOUR DOCTOR WANT YOU TO USE NEORAL SOFT GELATIN CAPSULES?
</EMPH>

</BLOCK>


</DIV>

</DIV>
<DIV type=1>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
If you have received an organ or bone marrow transplant
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Although you may have undergone a series of tests before your organ or bone marrow transplant to ensure that the match between your body and the transplanted organ or bone marrow was as close as possible, the donor tissue will still not be identical to your tissue. As a result, your body’s immune system will try to reject the donor tissue. 
<EMPH weight="bold">
NEORAL 
</EMPH>
helps to stop this rejection response by blocking the development of special cells which would normally attack the transplanted tissue.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>
<DIV type=1>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
If you have a severe skin complaint
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Some skin conditions, such as severe psoriasis or eczema (atopic dermatitis) are thought to be caused by your immune system overreacting. 
<EMPH weight="bold">
NEORAL 
</EMPH>
may help to stop this by suppressing the immune system, thereby improving your skin condition.
</BLOCK>

<PB n=1>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
If you have severe rheumatoid arthritis
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
It is thought that rheumatoid arthritis may be caused by inappropriate immune responses in your body. 
<EMPH weight="bold">
NEORAL
</EMPH>
 may help to stop this by suppressing your immune system, thereby improving your rheumatoid arthritis.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>
<DIV type=1>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
If you were previously  taking SANDIMMUN (cyclosporin) Soft Gelatin Capsules or Oral Solution 
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
NEORAL and 
<EMPH weight="bold">
SANDIMMUN
</EMPH>
 both contain cyclosporin as the active ingredient. However, 
<EMPH weight="bold">
NEORAL
</EMPH>
 is an improved formulation of cyclosporin and is, therefore, different to 
<EMPH weight="bold">
SANDIMMUN
</EMPH>
.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Because of this difference the absorption of cyclosporin into your blood should be much more reliable with 
<EMPH weight="bold">
NEORAL
</EMPH>
. Absorption of cyclosporin with 
<EMPH weight="bold">
NEORAL
</EMPH>
 Soft Gelatin Capsules is much less likely to be affected by taking it with food, again resulting in more consistent levels at cyclosporin in your blood. This is thought to be of particular importance in the prevention of rejection following transplantation, especially in the longer term.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Because of the difference in absorption of cyclosporin, your doctor will probably want to monitor you more closely for a short period following transfers from 
<EMPH weight="bold">
SANDIMMUN
</EMPH>
 to 
<EMPH weight="bold">
NEORAL
</EMPH>
, to make sure that you get the ideal dose for you. If your doctor transfers you from 
<EMPH weight="bold">
SANDIMMUN
</EMPH>
 to 
<EMPH weight="bold">
NEORAL
</EMPH>
, you should not go back to taking 
<EMPH weight="bold">
SANDIMMUN
</EMPH>
 unless your doctor tells you to.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you were previously using 
<EMPH weight="bold">
SANDIMMUN
</EMPH>
 and your doctor has now transferred you to 
<EMPH weight="bold">
NEORAL
</EMPH>
, any unused 
<EMPH weight="bold">
SANDIMMUN
</EMPH>
 that you have got left over should be returned to your pharmacist.

TAKING YOUR MEDICINE
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Your doctor will work out the correct dose of 
<EMPH weight="bold">
NEORAL 
</EMPH>
for you depending on your body weight and whether you are taking 
<EMPH weight="bold">
NEORAL 
</EMPH>
following a transplant or as a treatment for severe psoriasis, eczema or rheumatoid arthritis. Your doctor will also tell you how often to take your medicine.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you have had an organ or bone marrow transplant the total dose is usually within the range of 2mg/kg body weight per day and 15mg/kg body weight per day. Generally, the higher doses are used just after transplantation and the lower doses are used once your transplanted organ or bone marrow has stabilised. Your doctor will adjust your dose to one that is ideal for you. To do this he may need to do some blood tests.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
For the treatment of severe psoriasis and eczema the total dose is usually within the range of 2.5mg/kg body weight per day and 5mg/kg body weight per day.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
For the treatment of severe rheumatoid arthritis, the total daily dose is usually within the range of 2.5mg/kg body weight per day and 4mg/kg body weight per day.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Your doctor will tell you how much 
<EMPH weight="bold">
NEORAL 
</EMPH>
to take and how long you will need to take 
<EMPH weight="bold">
NEORAL
</EMPH>
, depending on whether you are taking it following transplantation or for the treatment of a severe skin condition or rheumatoid arthritis. For the treatment of severe eczema, treatment usually lasts for 8 weeks.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Follow your doctor’s instructions exactly and never change the dose yourself, however well you feel.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Do not stop taking your medicine unless your doctor tells you to, however well you feel. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure about how much medicine to take or when to take it.

AFTER TAKING YOUR MEDICINE
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Most people benefit from taking this medicine, but a few people can be upset by it. Once the ideal dose of 
<EMPH weight="bold">
NEORAL 
</EMPH>
has been established, the number of side-effects with 
<EMPH weight="bold">
NEORAL 
</EMPH>
is generally similar to that reported with 
<EMPH weight="bold">
SANDIMMUN
</EMPH>
 Soft Gelatin Capsules and Oral Solution.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The dose of this medicine needs to be carefully adjusted by your doctor. Too much can affect the kidneys. You will, therefore, have regular blood tests and visits to the hospital, particularly after transplantation. Your blood pressure will also be measured regularly. These visits will give you the chance to talk to your doctor about your treatment and mention any problems you are having.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you develop a sore throat, any infections or begin to feel generally unwell see your doctor immediately.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Side-effects that have sometimes been reported in patients taking cyclosporin include shakiness of the hands, upset stomach or abdominal pain, swollen gums, increased growth of hair on the body or face, high blood pressure, liver problems, tiredness and sensations of heat in the hands and feet.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
More rarely, headaches, skin rash, increased weight, fluid retention, confusion, feelings of numbness or tingling, muscle weakness or cramps, fits, gout, raised cholesterol levels, slight swelling of the breast tissue, changes in the menstrual period in women and tumours have also been reported.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
In liver transplant patients vision and movement disturbances, and loss of concentration have also been reported as side-effects However, although these effects have been reported in patients taking cyclosporin, they may not have actually been due to the medicine. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you suffer from any of these effects, or from any other side-effects not mentioned in this leaflet.
