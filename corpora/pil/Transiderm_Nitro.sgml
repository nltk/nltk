What you should know about Transiderm Nitro
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Please read this carefully before you start to use the patches. This leaflet does not contain the complete information about your patches. If you have any questions or are not sure about anything, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The name of these patches is Transiderm Nitro and they contain a substance called glyceryl trinitrate.  This is one of the group of medicines called <PB n=1> <CB n=1> nitrates, which help to relieve the symptoms of angina.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Angina means a painful tightness &quot;in the chest".  This is a good description of a typical attack, although the pain may also be felt in the arm or neck.  The pain really comes from the heart muscle and is a sign that part of it is not getting enough oxygen for the amount of work it has to do.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Transiderm Nitro is an adhesive patch containing a supply of glyceryl trinitrate which it releases through the skin and into the blood vessels. The diagram alongside shows how it works.
