Vagifem is a vaginal tablet containing a small dose of estradiol (an oestrogen). The vaginal tablet is inserted into the vagina, and the estradiol acts locally on the vagina. Each white Vagifem tablet comes in an applicator which is used once only. There are 15 applicators with vaginal tablets in each box. Vagifem is one of a group of hormone replacement therapies called topical (or local) HRT.

What is Vagifem for?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Vagifem is prescribed to relieve or eliminate symptoms in the vagina such as dryness or irritation. In medical terms this is known as atrophic vaginitis. It is caused by a loss of the female sex hormone, oestrogen, which occurs around the menopause.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The menopause is the time of a woman's last period. Before the menopause oestrogen is important in keeping the vagina moist. When the amount of this hormone falls before and after the menopause, some women get a drying and thinning of the vagina which can lead to soreness, discomfort during sexual intercourse, and possible infection. These symptoms may often start years after the menopause when amounts of oestrogen in the body have become very low. By treating your vagina with the oestrogen your body no longer produces, Vagifem relieves or eliminates these symptoms.

Important questions before using Vagifem

<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
Have you had cancer of the breast or endometrium (lining of the womb)
</BLOCK>

<ITEM>

<BLOCK>

Precautions
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Your doctor will carry out gynaecological and breast examinations as appropriate for you, and will treat any vaginal infection before you start with Vagifem.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
It has been established that the risk of endometrial cancer (cancer of the lining of the womb) is increased after treatment with higher doses of oestrogen given by mouth. Vagifem is a local treatment with a low dose of oestrogen and even though a minor degree of absorption of the oestrogen may occur, this side effect is most unlikely.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Tell your doctor if you have any persistent or recurring vaginal bleeding during use of Vagifem.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
There has been concern about the possible risk of breast cancer with oestrogen treatment. Many studies have not shown any increase in breast cancer but some have shown a small increase after prolonged treatment (five years or more). All of these studies have involved higher doses of oestrogen given by mouth. Because of the low dose and local treatment with Vagifem any effect on the risk of breast cancer is unlikely.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Vagifem should not be used by children or males.

Contraception
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
If you have passed the menopause you cannot become pregnant. If you are fertile or are not sure if you have passed the menopause, you should be aware that Vagifem is not a contraceptive. If you become pregnant whilst using Vagifem you must stop using It.

<HEAD weight="bold" >
Using your Vagifem
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
You can start using Vagifem on any convenient day. The white vaginal tablet is inserted deeply within the vagina using the disposable applicator.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The usual dose is one tablet inserted into the vagina each day for two weeks, and then one tablet inserted twice per week for a further 10 weeks. At the end of this treatment your doctor will usually decide whether further treatment is required or not.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
To insert the tablet follow the diagrams shown below. Each applicator containing one tablet, is wrapped in a blister pack backed with foil. The applicator with tablet must be removed from this pack just before insertion.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
Overdosage
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Because of the low dose of estradiol in Vagifem, using too many should not cause serious problems. However, if you think you have used more than you should, contact your doctor for advice.
</BLOCK>
