Do not take Sporanox if you are pregnant.

Other medicines    
</HEAD>


<PB n=6>


<CB n=1>


<FIGURE></FIGURE>


<CB n=2>


<BLOCK>
Always tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines because taking some medicines together can be harmful.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
For example, you should not take Sporanox if you are taking an antihistamine containing terfenadine or astemizole for hay fever or allergy. You should not take Sporanox if you are taking cisapride (a drug used for certain digestive problems) or midazolam or triazolam (drugs used as sleeping pills). Your doctor will need to know if you are using the antibiotic rifampicin or anti-epileptics such as phenytoin, as they may stop Sporanox from working properly.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Your doctor may need to alter the dose of certain other medicines before you begin your course of Sporanox. These include blood thinning agents, the heart drug digoxin, medicines known as cyclosporin A and tacrolimus which are usually given after an organ transplant. Special care is required if the tranquilliser midazolam is given intravenously during treatment with Sporanox. Sporanox can make the side effects of a medicine known as vincristine more severe and your doctor may need to change the dose of either or both of these medicines.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
There must be sufficient stomach acid to ensure that Sporanox is properly absorbed by the body. Therefore, medicines that neutralise stomach acid such as medicines for indigestion, stomach ulcers or heartburn, should not be taken sooner than 2 hours after Sporanox.

HOW TO USE YOUR MEDICINE    
</HEAD>


<PB n=7>


<CB n=1>


<FIGURE></FIGURE>

</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Your doctor will probably have recommended one of the following treatment courses with Sporanox:
</BLOCK>


<LIST type="bulleted">

<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
Yeast infection of the vagina (thrush) capsules for one day always taken as: two capsules, followed by another two capsules ideally 12 hours later (e.g. 2 capsules in the morning and 2 in the evening).
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
Yeast infection of the mouth (oral thrush) 1 capsule each day for 15 days
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>

<BLOCK>
For fungal infections of the skin the dosage depends on your condition. It is likely to be either:

<DIV type=2>

2 capsules each day for 7 days or 1 capsule each day for 15 days

<LIST type="bulleted">

<BLOCK>

<EMPH slant = "italic">
or
</EMPH>
 1 capsule each day for 30 days
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
For treatment or prevention of fungal infections of other parts of the body the dosage and length of treatment varies depending on the type of infection. Your doctor may sometimes prescribe Sporanox at different dosages or for different lengths of time. Talk to your doctor if this applies to you.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>

</LIST>



<BLOCK>
It is important that you carry on taking your medicine for as long as your doctor has told you to. Do not stop your treatment just because you feel better
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
With skin infections, the patches on your skin may only disappear completely a few weeks after you have finished your treatment with Sporanox. This is because your skin will only appear normal once new skin has grown, even though Sporanox has already killed the fungus causing the infection.
