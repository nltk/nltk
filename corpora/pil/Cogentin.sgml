How does your medicine work?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
The active ingredient in your injection is benztropine mesylate. Benztropine mesylate is a medicine which has strong 'anticholinergic' effects. This means that it works by decreasing the amount of a chemical in the brain called 'acetylcholine’. This chemical is naturally occurring but, if levels of this chemical in the body are too high, it causes movement difficulties.

Why do you need to be given this medicine?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Your doctor has prescribed Cogentin for you because you have Parkinson's disease, or symptoms which are seen with this condition, caused by some other drugs you may have taken such as phenothiazines or reserpine. These symptoms may include tremor and difficulty with moving. Your injection will help restore the balance of acetylcholine in your body and help to control your movement difficulties.
