Why has my child been given NIVAQUINE Syrup?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
NIVAQUINE is usually given to help prevent your child getting malaria. Malaria is spread by mosquitos. Some mosquitos carry the malaria parasites and can infect your child with them if they bite your child - it can take up to a week or more to develop malaria after an infected bite . NIVAQUINE can help prevent your child getting malaria when your child has been bitten by a mosquito. Like other similar medicines, in some cases NIVAQUINE will not give complete protection against malaria. It is, therefore, important you follow all other medical advice.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Make sure that you have told your doctor or pharmacist which countries you are visiting. In some parts of the world the malaria parasites are not affected by chloroquine. If your child has been given another anti-malarial medicine to take with NIVAQUINE, then you must follow the separate directions for it.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Sometimes your doctor may have prescribed NIVAQUINE for treating other conditions. Please contact your doctor if this is the case.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If your child is already taking NIVAQUINE or medicines called &quot;Avloclor" or &quot;PIaquenil" for another condition consult your doctor.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Keep this leaflet for reference until your child has finished taking the medicine.

The dose for children depends on their weight
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
Weigh your child, preferably, in kilograms.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
Use the table below to show the correct dose.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
For example, if your child weighs 20 kg (about 3st 2lbs) the dose of NIVAQUINE Syrup is two x 5 ml spoonfuls ( 10 mls).
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
When the weight of your child lies between two weights on the table use the lower dose. For example, if your child weighs 25kg the correct dose is two x 5ml spoonfuls ( 10 mls) of NIVAQUINE syrup.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
For doses less than 5ml your pharmacist can supply you with a syringe to measure out the NIVAQUINE syrup.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
When you have worked out the dose, do it again to make sure you have done it properly.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<FIGURE></FIGURE>
<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
Your child should take one full dose at one time. So. if the dose is three x 5ml spoonfuls, this should be taken all at once.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
If possible. your child should start by taking the dose of syrup above, 1 week before entering a country where malaria may be present.

When your child arrives home he/she should continue to take the dose of syrup once a week for 4 weeks. You must remember to be sure that your child keeps taking the syrup when you are at home-even if your child feels perfectly well. Malaria can develop some time after being bitten by a mosquito. If your child stops taking the syrup this will increase the risk of developing malaria when you are at home.
