The main active ingredient - clobetasone butyrate 0 05% an antibacterial agent - oxytetracycline an anticandidal agent - nystatin a preservative - chlorocresol an antioxidant - sodium metabisulphite (E223) a colouring agent - titanium dioxide (E171) in a base containing glyceryl monostearate, cetostearyl alcohol, polyoxyl 40 stearate, dimethicone 20, glycerol and white soft paraffin

YOU SHOULD NOT use on large areas of the body for a long time (such as nearly every day for many weeks or months). Although Trimovate Cream is generally regarded as safe even when used like this for many months it may be possible to produce side effects if

overused
