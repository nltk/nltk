The pessary should be used to

treat 
</EMPH>
vaginal thrush.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Vaginal thrush (candidiasis) is a common infection caused by a fungus which may live harmlessly in the vagina without you even noticing it.  However, in certain circumstances it may develop into an infection in the vagina and the symptoms may spread to the surrounding area (the vulva).
</BLOCK>

<CB n=1>

<BLOCK>
The common symptoms of thrush are:

When should l use Canesten 1% Cream?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
The cream should be used to soothe and relieve the irritation of the vulva (vulvitis) which is caused by thrush.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
It can also be used for the treatment of irritation of the end of the penis (glans) which is caused by thrush.  If the cream is used to treat your sexual partner at the same time as your own treatment, it can help prevent re-infection and so reduce the frequency of your attacks of thrush.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Canesten 1% cream can also be used to treat fungal skin infections such as ringworm, athlete's foot, fungal nappy rash and fungal infection of the breast fold (intertrigo).

When and how do I use Canesten Combi?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
This carton contains one Canesten 1 Pessary held inside a foil blister pack, an applicator for insertion of the pessary into the vagina and a tube of Canesten 1% cream. This is a full course of treatment.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If Canesten Combi has been prescribed for you by your doctor, follow any instructions he/she may have given you.  If you have purchased this product without a prescription, follow these directions closely:

Canesten 1 Pessary
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
The applicator should be used to insert the pessary into the vagina before going to sleep at night.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Remove the applicator from the packaging.  Pull out plunger A until it stops.  Remove the pessary from the blister pack and place the pessary firmly into applicator B (Diagram 1).  To fit the pessary into the applicator, the holder of the applicator needs to be squeezed lightly at either side.  The pessary fits tightly into the applicator and needs to be squeezed into the holder just far enough to be held in place during insertion (about 1 cm).
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Carefully put the applicator as deeply as is comfortable in the vagina (this is easiest when lying on your back with your knees bent up) (Diagram 2).
</BLOCK>

<CB n=1>
<FIGURE></FIGURE>

<BLOCK>
Holding the applicator in place, slowly press the plunger until it stops so that the pessary is deposited into the vagina (Diagram 3).
</BLOCK>

<FIGURE></FIGURE>

<BLOCK>
Remove the applicator.  Dispose of the applicator in a safe place, out of the reach of children.  The applicator cannot be flushed down the toilet.
