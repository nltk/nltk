<BLOCK>
You can help prevent further infections if you follow these simple self-help tips:
</BLOCK>


<LIST type="bulleted">

<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
Try to avoid wearing tight nylon knickers and close fitting jeans too often.  These provide warm and airless conditions which help the thrush fungus to grow.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
Wash daily, but use simple, unperfumed soaps – not heavily scented or medicated ones.  Do not scrub hard with sponges or flannels, and avoid hot baths with strong perfumed oils or disinfectants.  The most soothing bath to have if you have thrush is a warm one with some salt in it.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
After going to the toilet, do get into the habit of wiping yourself from front to back, as a thrush infection may easily be transferred from the bowel.
</BLOCK>
