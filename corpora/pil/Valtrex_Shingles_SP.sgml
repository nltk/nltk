What is Valtrex for?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Valtrex is an antiviral medicine.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
It is used to treat shingles (herpes zoster) infections. Shingles is caused by the varicella-zoster virus which damages nerves and skin. Valtrex stops the virus from multiplying and so cuts down this damage, reducing the painful, blistering rash.

More about shingles
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
You can only get shingles if you have already had chickenpox. This is because shingles is caused by the chickenpox virus becoming active again. The virus multiplies in the nerves and the skin. This causes the painful, blistering rash of shingles, usually in a band across one side of your body or face. Early treatment with an antiviral like Valtrex stops the virus multiplying so if you start your treatment straight away the tablets should help you to get better quicker.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
What can I expect?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Your rash may be very painful at first, and you may still get new blisters appearing for about 5 days, then they will start to dry and form scabs. The rash may itch as it heals.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
You may also feel very tired for a few weeks. For some time after the rash has disappeared, some people may still feel pain in that part of the body. As well as pain, some people may get &quot;abnormal sensations&quot; such as prickling and numbness where the rash was. These effects are caused by the shingles virus affecting the nerve during the early stage of the illness.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>
<DIV type=2>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
What else can I do?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Keeping the skin cool by using cool water compresses or calamine lotion can help the stinging and itching. Try to avoid scratching the rash, as this can stop it healing or could infect it with bacteria. Common painkillers such as aspirin or paracetamol can help with the pain. Make sure you eat well and drink plenty of fluids.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you have any trouble with your eyes while you have shingles, see your doctor straight away, as you may need special treatments.

Who can catch shingles?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
People of all ages get shingles, but it is more common in older people. Shingles can be passed on as chickenpox to other people if they have not already had chickenpox. For this reason, before the blisters have scabbed over, you should especially avoid close contact with:
