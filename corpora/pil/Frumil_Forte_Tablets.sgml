FRUMIL FORTE TABLETS ?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
FRUMIL FORTE tablets may be prescribed when there is a build-up of excess water in the body. Excess water can build up in certain conditions which affect the heart, blood vessels, lungs, kidneys or liver.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
For example: if the heart is not pumping properly, water can build up in some parts of the body (most noticeably the ankles). This may result in shortness of breath and excessive tiredness.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Your doctor may prescribe these tablets for other reasons. Ask your doctor for any information you need.

Changing your diet
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
If you are overweight your heart has more to cope with. So it's a good idea to get as close to your "ideal" weight as possible. If you do not know what your "ideal" weight should be, check with your doctor, surgery nurse or pharmacist.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Whatever weight you are, it's also important to cut down the amount of fat you eat, preferably by up to a quarter. You can do this by:
</BLOCK>


<LIST type="bulleted">

<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
eating less red meat and more chicken, fish and vegetables,
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>

Giving up smoking
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>

Stress - and how to avoid it
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
You can help your heart by learning to enjoy relaxation and avoid stressful situations. Obviously you can't avoid stress altogether but if you follow a regular routine that puts less pressure on you then you'll be all the better for it.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>
<DIV type=3>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
What about alcohol?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Moderate drinking, such as half a pint of beer or a glass or two of wine a day, but not every day, won't harm the heart. However, you should avoid drinking more than this as it may affect your heart and increase your weight into the bargain.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>
<DIV type=3>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
Finding the right exercise
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Your doctor can advise you on a planned programme of activity. This will improve your general health without putting too much of a strain on your heart. At first, you should avoid walking up steep hills or staircases with lots of steps. Eventually, though, you can build up to a regular routine of walking, swimming or cycling, or a combination of these.
