What is Retrovir treatment and how does it work?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Retrovir is the brand name for the drug zidovudine, sometimes known as AZT. It belongs to a group of medicines called antivirals. It is used to delay the progression of HIV infection. In order to understand how Retrovir works, it will help you to know how HIV multiplies within the body.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
HIV reproduces itself by entering CD4 cells and turning them into 'mini factories' producing more viruses which, in turn, infect more cells. If this process goes untreated, eventually there are too few CD4 cells left to fight off diseases and infections - a condition which usually leads to AIDS.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Retrovir does not kill HIV, but works by entering the CD4 cells infected with it, helping to stop the production of new viruses and their despatch to other cells. Retrovir therefore helps to preserve your ability to resist disease by helping to prevent further deterioration of the immune system.

Taking your medicine
</HEAD>


<LIST type="bulleted">

<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
It is important to take your medicine as directed by your doctor. The label should tell you how much to take and how often. If you're not absolutely sure, consult your doctor.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
The dose prescribed will vary from patient to patient and will depend on a number of factors, including the stage of infection. In practice a total daily quantity of between 500mg and 1000mg is usually prescribed divided into appropriate doses
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
The capsules should be swallowed whole with some water.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
If you forget to take a dose, don't worry. Simply take it as soon as you remember and then continue as before.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
If you think you may have difficulty in remembering to take your capsules at the times specified, it’s a good idea to use a pocket timer or wrist-watch alarm to remind you.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
Whilst accidentally taking a larger dose than prescribed is not likely to cause any untoward effect, you should let your doctor know as soon as possible in such a situation.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>

<EMPH weight="bold">
Because your medicine controls and does not cure your condition, you will normally need to take it continually. You should not stop treatment unless your doctor tells you to.
</EMPH>

</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
Remember that treatment with Retrovir does not reduce the risk of passing HIV on to others by sexual contact or blood transfer, so you will remain infectious whilst taking the capsules

Retrovir is normally well tolerated, particularly by patients with early HIV infection. However, because of the way it works, it may sometimes cause side effects of which there are two main types, as follows;
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>

</LIST>



<LIST type="ordered">

<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
The first can occur during the first 4 to 5 weeks of treatment and consists of nausea, vomiting and headache. Very rarely, muscular aches and a rash may also develop. In the vast majority of cases, all these effects disappear on their own after a few weeks, a fact worth bearing in mind if you experience them. Check with your doctor if they do not go away or become distressing.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
The second can develop after four to six weeks of treatment and affects your bone marrovv's production of blood cells. Most commonly, production of red blood cells is reduced, resulting in anaemia. If this happens, the symptoms are tiredness and shortness of breath. Also, less commonly, the production of a type of white blood cell may be reduced which can make you more prone to infections. Studies have shown that these side effects occur in 5% or less of patients being treated for early HIV infection.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>

</LIST>



<LIST type="bulleted">

<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
These effects are generally reversible and it is important to note that, with the lower treatment doses currently being prescribed, anaemia is now less common than when Retrovir was first introduced.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
If you experience either type of the side effects associated with Retrovir, consult your doctor. He is likely to either reduce your dose or temporarily interrupt your treatment, usually for between two and four weeks, in order to allow your blood time to recover.

Can I take other medication whilst on treatment?
</HEAD>


<LIST type="bulleted">

<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
You can assume that any medication prescribed by a doctor who has full knowledge of your condition and treatment will be safe to take along with Retrovir.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
In fact, as pan of your treatment, your doctor may offer you other medication to treat or prevent the opportunistic infections that may occur.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
Problems can arise with medication that has not been prescribed by your doctor but which you may be in the habit of using or consider taking.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
Taking any of these medications, eg paracetamol, along with Retrovir, without your doctor's knowledge may be harmful. This is because some preparations can interact adversely with Retrovir and make side effects worse if taken at the same time.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
However, few adverse reactions have been noted by patients who take vitamin supplements, herbal remedies or homeopathic medicines, so if you feel benefit from these, continue taking them but keep your doctor informed.

Is it safe to drink alcohol whilst on treatment?
</HEAD>


<LIST type="bulleted">

<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
Alcohol can affect your response to many medications and you should discuss this matter in more detail with your doctor who will be familiar with your own particular case. Remember that excess alcohol in general can affect your overall health.

It is important to understand that Retrovir can delay and slow down the progression of HIV infection, but you must be aware of the possibility of eventually developing symptomatic infection.
</BLOCK>

Resistance of the virus to Retrovir has been shown in a number of people and is more frequent in those with symptomatic infection. The importance of this in the overall future progression of the virus is not at present known.
