Further Information Interesting Facts about Head Lice
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>

What are Head lice?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Head lice are small insects (their size can vary depending on the stage of their development, but adults are usually between 2-3 mm long when fully grown) which vary in colour from greyish white to brown. They like to set up home in a warm head of human hair and have no preference for the type of hair, be it brunette or blonde, straight or curly, head lice are not fussy. One preference they do show is contrary to common belief, they prefer clean hair to dirty hair.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
There is only one way for head lice to pass from one individual to another and this is by head to head contact. Head lice cannot jump, hop or fly from one person to another, and it is also not possible for them to be passed on things like towels, combs and chair backs. A louse off the head will die very quickly.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Head lice spend most of their time on or near to the scalp as they need warmth to survive. They grip on to the hair by means of special claws and feed on the scalp by sucking up blood.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The female louse will lay up to 8 oval shaped eggs every night, gluing them to the base of individual hairs. After about seven days a young louse (nymph) emerges leaving behind it a white egg shell. These white egg shells remain glued to the hair and are known as nits. The nymph will begin feeding in the same way as the adult and within about ten days will be mature and capable of breeding

What to look for
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Due to their size, colour and rapid movement head lice are very difficult to see. The eggs (creamy brown) are a little bit easier to spot and will be found attached to individual hairs near to the scalp. In contrast the white nits can often be seen further from the scalp, this is because as the hair grows the nits (which are still glued to the hair shaft) move with it. The best way to find head lice and their eggs is to run a tine-toothed comb (the detection comb found in each pack of Lyclear Creme Rinse is ideal) through damp parted hair looking carefully for evidence of lice. Signs to look for include faeces, cast skins, or dead lice Louse faeces appears in black flecks like dust, often this is rubbed onto collars, or the pillow at night resulting in shirts and bed clothes becoming dirty more quickly than usual.
