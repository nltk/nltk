MORE ABOUT OVESTIN TABLETS
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Ovestin Tablets contains oestriol, one of the natural female sex hormones (oestrogens or estrogens).
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Oestrogens are produced in the ovaries They cause sexual development in women and control the menstrual cycle during the childbearing years.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
When women get older the ovaries gradually produce less oestrogen This happens at the menopause (usually around the age of 50).
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If the ovaries are removed surgically (ovariectomy} before the menopause, oestrogen production stops very suddenly.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Shortage of oestrogens may lead to complaints such as vaginal infections and recurrent cystitis.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
These complaints can be relieved by taking medicines containing oestrogen. However it may take several days or weeks before you notice an improvement.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Unlike most oestrogens, oestriol has little effect on the inner lining of the womb. So Ovestin Tablets usually do not cause vaginal bleeding.
