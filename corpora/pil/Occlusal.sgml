Indications and Usage:

 The treatment and removal of common and plantar warts.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>

<EMPH weight="bold">
Dosage and Administration:
</EMPH>
 Before applying Occlusal, soak the wart in warm water for five minutes.  Remove any loosened tissue with a brush, pumice stone or emery board and dry the area with a towel not used by others, to avoid passing the infection on, as warts are contagious.  Apply Occlusal carefully to the wart twice, using the applicator brush provided, avoiding contact with the surrounding healthy skin.  Allow the first application to dry completely before applying the second.  Treatment should be repeated daily and continued for as long as your doctor advises.  Improvement may be seen in one to two weeks, but complete removal may take between six and twelve weeks, depending on the size and location of the wart.  If the wart is not successfully treated in twelve weeks, go back to your doctor.  The dosage is the same for children, adults and the elderly.

Precautions:
</EMPH>
 Occlusal is for external use only.  Do not permit contact with eyes or mucous membranes.  If contact occurs flush Immediately with water for 15 minutes.  Do not allow contact with normal skin around wart.  Avoid using on areas of broken or damaged skin.  Discontinue treatment if excessive irritation occurs.  A localised irritation may occur if Occlusal is accidentally brought into contact with healthy skin surrounding the wart.  This can normally be controlled by stopping application for a few days and being more careful in applying the solution when treatment is resumed.  Continuous use of Occlusal during pregnancy and lactation particularly if large areas of skin are involved, should be avoided.  Salicylic acid preparations can cause a condition known as salicylism if large doses are used over a long period.  The most frequent symptom of salicylism is ringing in the ears and if this is experienced you should stop treatment and contact your doctor.
