When used in large quantities over a long period of time, the Cream may be absorbed through the skin and this may increase the possibility of changes in the skin (the skin may seem thinner than normal and the blood veins close to the skin surface may be more noticeable). Long-term treatment should be avoided in infants, children and pregnant women.

Remember this treatment is for you. Only a doctor can prescribe it for you. Do not let other people use your Cream even if their skin problem seems to be the same as yours.
