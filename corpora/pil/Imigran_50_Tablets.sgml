<BLOCK>
Imigran-50 tablets contain sumatriptan, the first of a new group of medicines developed for the treatment of migraine. The symptoms of migraine may be due to swollen blood vessels around the brain. Medicines like Imigran probably work by reducing the size of these blood vessels and are called 5HT1, receptor agonists.

How to take your tablets
</HEAD>




<BLOCK>
Look at the label - It should say WHO should take them, HOW MANY and WHEN If it does not or you are not sure, ask your doctor or pharmacist or follow this advice:
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
At the first signs of a migraine attack take ONE tablet If this does not make your migraine better do 
<EMPH weight="bold">
NOT
</EMPH>
 take any more tablets for this attack If your migraine goes then comes back you may take another tablet .
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Some people find they need to take TWO tablets for each attack instead of ONE.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Whichever dose is taken DO NOT TAKE MORE THAN 6 tablets in any 24 hour period, that is 300mg in total. Swallow each tablet whole with a little water. Do not chew or crush them.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
There is little experience of Imigran in children or those over 65 years of age so it is not usually prescribed for these age groups.
</BLOCK>

<BLOCK>
Within an hour or two of taking a dose most people find their migraine is much better. If this does not ease your migraine, then you may take your usual 'pain killers', provided they do not contain ergotamine. Wait at least six hours after taking an Imigran-50 tablet before taking any medicines containing ergotamine.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Most people find taking this medicine causes no problems. As with most medicines, a few people may find they have side-effects to it.
