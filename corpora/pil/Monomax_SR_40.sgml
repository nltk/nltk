ABOUT YOUR MEDICINE
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
ISMN belongs to a group of medicines called nitrates. It is used to prevent the symptoms of angina (chest pain) from happening. Angina usually occurs as a pain or tightness in the chest although it may be felt in the neck or arm. The pain happens when the muscle in the heart does not receive enough oxygen for the work it has to do. ISMN works by improving the blood supply to the heart, by enlarging the blood vessels in the heart muscle.
