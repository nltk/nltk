Q.Should I continue to have sex?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
A.It is not a good idea to have sex while you have a thrush infection as it is easily transmitted to your sexual partner who might in turn give it back to you. Also Ecostatin can damage the rubber of contraceptive diaphragms and condoms (sheaths) so that they are no longer safe to use.
