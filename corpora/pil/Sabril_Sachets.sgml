Taking your medicine
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
It is important to follow your doctor's instructions exactly. Never change the dose yourself.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Do not open the sachets until it is time for you to take your medicine. To take a dose you should dissolve all the powder from the recommended number of sachets in half a tumbler full of cold water or soft drink. When all the powder has dissolved, drink all of the solution straightaway and do not leave it standing.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The usual starting dose for adults is 2 sachets daily. However, your doctor may wish to increase or decrease the dose depending on your response.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Also if you are elderly and have kidney problems your doctor may wish to give you a smaller dose.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The usual starting dose for children is 40 milligrams per kilogram bodyweight daily. However, the doctor may wish to increase the dose to 80-100 milligrams per kilogram bodyweight daily depending on the child's response.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The following table gives the number of Sabril Sachets to give to a child according to his/her bodyweight. Remember, this is just a guideline. The child's doctor may wish to give slightly different doses.
