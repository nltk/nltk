ISTIN for?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
ISTIN is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) or to control and relieve a certain type of chest pain called angina.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
In patients with high blood pressure ISTIN works by relaxing blood vessels, so that blood passes through them more easily. In patients with angina ISTIN works by improving blood supply to the heart muscle which then receives more oxygen and as a result chest pain is prevented.
