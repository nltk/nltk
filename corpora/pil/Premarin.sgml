What is in my tablets?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
The name of your medicine is Premarin. It contains a mixture of natural hormones called conjugated oestrogens. Premarin is available in three different strengths: the maroon tablets contain 0.625 mg conjugated oestrogens, the yellow tablets contain 1.25 mg conjugated oestrogens and the purple tablets contain 2.5 mg conjugated oestrogens.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Premarin tablets also contain lactose, methylcellulose, magnesium stearate, sucrose, glyceryl monoleate, polyethylene glycol, carnauba wax, calcium sulphate anhydrous, microcrystalline cellulose, pharmaceutical glaze (shellac), sodium benzoate, polyvinylpyrrolidone and titanium dioxide(E171).
</BLOCK>

</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>

What are my tablets used for?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
During the menopause, the level of the oestrogen in your body will decrease. Oestrogen is one of the main hormones responsible for maintaining your normal menstrual cycle. As the amount of oestrogen produced by your body decreases, the menstrual cycle may become irregular and a period may only occur once every few months. Eventually your periods will stop altogether.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Oestrogen is also responsible for helping to keep many tissues in the body healthy, such as the skin, bones, urinary system and the lining of the vagina. The lack of oestrogen which causes the menopause is also responsible for many of the unpleasant symptoms you have at this time. By replacing the oestrogen that your body no longer produces, Premarin can relieve some of these symptoms, such as hot flushes, night sweats and vaginal dryness. It can also help to prevent bone thinning (osteoporosis).
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Premarin is usually prescribed for women who have had their womb removed (hysterectomy). However, women who have not had this operation can still take Premarin and their doctor will prescribe a second type of tablet containing another hormone called a progestogen, to be taken 12-14 days per month as well as the Premarin tablets.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>

<EMPH slant = "italic">
If you have not had a hysterectomy you should not take Premarin without an additional progestogen tablet for 12-14 days each month.

 therapy. It provides low doses of oestrogen to replace the hormone your body is no longer providing. The lack of oestrogen in your body results in many of the unpleasant symptoms of the menopause; by replacing the oestrogen with HRT these symptoms can be relieved.

What should I know before taking my tablets?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Some studies with HRT have shown a small increased risk of breast cancer where HRT has been used over a long period of time. Other studies, however, have not shown this link. Whilst taking HRT you should regularly check your breasts and tell your doctor if you find any lumps.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you have a history of breast lumps, your doctor will regularly check your breasts for any changes.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you have not had a hysterectomy you should be aware that there is an increased risk of cancer of the lining of the womb (endometrium) associated with taking oestrogen-only HRT like Premarin. Your doctor will prescribe additional tablets containing a progestogen for 12-14 days each month to remove this risk.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you have suffered from blood clots in your legs or lungs, a stroke or heart attack, your doctor will monitor you closely.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
It is unlikely that HRT will affect your blood pressure. Your doctor will monitor your blood pressure at your regular check ups, especially if you are already being treated for high blood pressure.
</BLOCK>

Special warnings
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Certain diseases may be made worse by HRT. If you have any of the following conditions your doctor will monitor you closely: otosclerosis multiple sclerosis systemic lupus erythematosis, porphyria, melanoma thyrotoxicosis, diabetes, depression, asthma, migraine, epilepsy, fibroids or endometriosis. Tell your doctor if you notice any change in your condition whilst taking Premarin.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The risk of gall bladder disease is slightly increased in women taking HRT.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
HRT may affect some medical tests. If you visit a hospital or clinic for any medical tests you should tell the doctor concerned that you are taking HRT.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>
<DIV type=1>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
Is Premarin like the contraceptive Pill?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
No. The contraceptive Pill uses higher doses of synthetic hormones to prevent ovulation and fertilisation of eggs. Premarin is NOT a contraceptive. It is important that you use a reliable form of non hormonal contraception if there is any possibility that you may still become pregnant. You should discuss this with your doctor.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>
<DIV type=1>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
My periods have stopped. Will they start again whilst taking Premarin?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
No not if you have had a hysterectomy, you will be taking an additional progestogen tablet for 12-14 days each month, and you will probably have a "period", or withdrawal bleed, each month, at about the time you finish the additional progestogen tablets. This is caused by the hormones and is perfectly natural. Some women taking "combined HRT" (oestrogen plus the additional progestogen) may experience a gradual reduction in withdrawal bleeding and it may eventually stop, this is quite normal. If you have heavy or irregular bleeding you should tell your doctor.

Will Premarin affect my driving?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
There is no evidence to suggest that taking Premarin will affect your ability to drive or to operate machinery.

How do I take my tablets
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
You may start your first pack at any convenient time. The usual dose is one tablet per day, to be swallowed with a drink of water.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Do not leave a break between packs unless your doctor tells you to. Do not stop taking Premarin without first discussing it with your doctor.

How long do I need to take Premarin for?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
That really depends on why you and your doctor have decided on a course of treatment. If you are taking HRT to relieve your immediate menopausal symptoms like hot flushes and night sweats, you may be prescribed HRT for between three to twelve months or longer. If, however, you or your doctor are worried about osteoporosis and you wish to protect yourself now for the future, you may be prescribed HRT for between five to ten years or even longer.

<HEAD weight="bold" >
What if I miss a tablet or tablets?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember, then go on as before. If more than one tablet has been missed take the tablet for the day that you remember and continue as normal.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>
<DIV type=1>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
What if I take too many tablets?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Do not worry. Premarin contains natural hormones and it is unlikely that serious problems will occur. If in any doubt, consult your doctor or pharmacist.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
You may feel some nausea (sickness), or experience a short period of vaginal bleeding (unless you have had a hysterectomy) if you take too many tablets.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
Can I wash off the coating or crush the tablets?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
It is best not to try to take off the coating or crush the tablets, as this could affect the way Premarin works. The dyes used are approved for use as food colourings. They are needed so that Premarin can be identified from other tablets, and so that the different strengths of Premarin can be easily recognised.
