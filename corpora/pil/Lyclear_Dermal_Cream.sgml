What is scabies?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Scabies is caused by a mite called 
<EMPH slant = "italic">
Sarcoptes scabiei
</EMPH>
. The female mite burrows into the outer layers of the skin to lay its eggs. The female mite is larger than the male and is just visible to the naked eye {0 4 x 0 3mm).
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The female mite feeds on skin cells as she burrows and lays her eggs behind her.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
This burrowing into the skin is usually painless; at this stage the infection is not noticed.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The intense itch and rash of scabies is caused by an allergic reaction to the mites, their droppings or their dead bodies.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The scabies itch often takes 3 - 4 weeks to develop and is often worst at night. The itch usually occurs on the hands, arms, legs, inner thighs and around the waist. However the mites themselves are found on and between the fingers, on the wrists, feet, toes, ankles, elbows, knees, arm-pits genitals and buttocks. In women, the breasts may also be affected.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
In adults the face and neck are hardly ever affected, but scabies can affect the faces of babies.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The skin can become raised and red at the site of each mite; this is most common on the fingers.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
These lesions are often made worse by scratching and secondary infection.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>
<DIV type=2>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
How is scabies caught?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
The scabies mite is transmitted by direct and prolonged skin contact (for example holding hands). It is commonly passed between family members and partners sharing the same bed, or any other intimate personal contact. Scabies cannot be caught from bed linen or clothing.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>
<DIV type=2>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
Treatment
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Treatment of scabies is simple and effective. The treatment is applied to the whole body from the neck down, and all family members should be treated at the same time. Babies and children under 2 years should also have their necks, faces, ears and scalps treated. You should not have a bath before treatment; in fact, treatment should be to clean but cool skin. Ideally, someone else should apply the treatment, so that the whole body surface is covered. Try to ensure that the cream is applied systematically so that no patches of skin are missed. Remember to treat the palms of hands and soles of feet, in between fingers and toes, and underneath finger and toe nails.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
After treatment the itch may remain or increase for a while but will go away gradually after 1 - 2 weeks, when all of the dead mites have been rubbed off along with the outer layers of the skin. The itching can be relieved by using Calamine lotion or anti-histamine tablets/syrup.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
It is not necessary to boil wash underwear, nightwear or bed linen. The normal washing procedure should be followed for these items after treatment
</BLOCK>
