</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Klaricid Paediatric Suspension should be given twice a day, once in the morning and again in the early evening. It can be given at mealtimes if this is most convenient. You should shake the bottle well before using and close it tightly afterwards. The sachet should be reconstituted by cutting along the dotted line, emptying the contents of the sachet into a glass and half filling the sachet with cold water.  Add to the glass and stir thoroughly before taking.  Klaricid Paediatric Suspension is usually given for 5 to 10 days.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you forget to give your child a dose of medicine, give one as soon as you remember.  Do not give more Klaricid Paediatric Suspension in one day than your doctor tells you to.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Do not stop giving this medicine because your child feels better.  It is important to give the medicine for as long as the doctor has told you to, otherwise the problem may come back.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you accidentally give your child more Klaricid Paediatric Suspension in one day than your doctor has told you to, or if your child accidentally swallows some extra medicine, seek medical advice urgently. An overdose of Klaricid Paediatric Suspension is likely to cause vomiting and stomach pains.

What problems can Klaricid Paediatric Suspension cause?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Klaricid Paediatric Suspension can sometimes cause stomach problems such as feeling sick, vomiting, stomach pain or diarrhoea. If your child develops severe or prolonged diarrhoea during or after receiving Klaricid Paediatric Suspension consult your doctor immediately. Headache can also occur rarely.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Your child may complain of having a funny taste in their mouth whilst taking Klaricid Paediatric Suspension. Sometimes the tongue darkens in colour. However these are only temporary effects and you should not stop giving the medicine because of them. There have also been reports of Klaricid Paediatric Suspension causing a swollen tongue or a sore mouth.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If your child has a blood test whilst taking Klaricid Paediatric Suspension he/she may be found to have raised liver enzymes. These levels will soon return to normal and your child is unlikely to show any symptoms. However, Klaricid Paediatric Suspension can rarely cause jaundice and other liver disorders, so if your child is generally unwell or develops yellow skin and/or eyes, consult your doctor immediately.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Allergic reactions including rashes have been reported with Klaricid Paediatric Suspension. In very rare cases, difficulty of breathing, fainting and swelling of the face and throat can occur which may need emergency treatment. Allergic rashes may range in severity from mild itchy skin eruptions to a rarer, more serious condition which may cause ulceration of the mouth, lips and skin.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
There have also been a few reports of dizziness, difficulty sleeping, hallucinations (seeing things), bad dreams, confusion and panicking.  These effects are short-lived and soon disappear. Very rarely, mood and behavioural disorders have been reported, which in severe cases have required hospitalisation.  Consult your doctor if your child develops any of these problems or has any other unexpected or unusual symptoms.
