What is ‘Algitec' and how does it work?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
'Algitec' is an antacid. If the acid from your stomach comes up into your gullet (reflux) it can cause pain and inflammation. 'Algitec' can help to treat this in two ways. In your stomach, Fe alginate (alginic acid) makes a frothy layer or raft which floats on the stomach contents and helps to prevent them coming up into your gullet. Cimetidine (which u a histamine H2 receptor antagonist) helps to reduce the amount of acid being produced in your stomach, so even if the contents get through the alginate rat, there is much less acid to cause any damage.

<EMPH weight="bold">
Smoking
</EMPH>
 - As well as the well-known dangers of smoking, it has been shown that smoking stops the valve-like muscle at the bottom of the gullet from working properly. Stopping smoking, or greatly cutting down, will help your reflux.

<EMPH weight="bold">
Sleeping
</EMPH>
 -When you are Iying down it is easier for the stomach contents to leak" into the oesophagus (gullet) causing heartburn. Raising the head of your best on wooden blocks or bricks can help a great deal.
