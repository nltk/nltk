Why Metrodin High Purity?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Metrodin High Purity is a hormone known as follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). It works in exactly the same way as FSH which is naturally found in the body. It is used to treat infertility in women. It is used in two situations as shown below:
</BLOCK>


<LIST type="ordered">

<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
Metrodin High Purity is used in women who have a condition called hypothalamic pituitary dysfunction. If you have this condition, you may be having irregular periods or you may not be having periods at all. The medicine is used to bring about the development of a follicle. It is followed by treatment with another hormone which leads to ovulation (the release of the egg from the follicle).
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
Metrodin High Purity is used to bring about the development of several follicles (and therefore several eggs) for women undergoing assisted conception techniques, e.g. in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) or gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT).
