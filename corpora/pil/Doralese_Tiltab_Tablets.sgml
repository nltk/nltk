YOUR MEDICINE IS 'DORALESE'
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>

<EMPH weight="bold">
What is 'Doralese'?  
</EMPH>
'Doralese' is the maker's name for this medicine for treating an enlarged prostate gland (benign prostatic hypertrophy).  Each 'Doralese' Tablet contains 20 milligrams of indoramin, the ingredient that treats the condition.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>

<EMPH weight="bold">
What is the prostate?
</EMPH>
  The prostate is a gland at the bottom of the bladder.  It surrounds the tube (the urethra) that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body.  If the prostate becomes bigger, it may "squeeze" the urethra making it difficult for you to pass urine.  This means that the flow of urine may be weaker or that you may have to pass water much more often than before.  This can happen during the day and also at night so you may have to get up several times every night to pass water.  It can also mean that you may have to wait for the urine flow to start, or that it may be difficult for you to stop completely.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
As men get older, their prostate grows in size and some men will suffer these symptoms.  Some will need a simple operation to relieve these symptoms; others will not need any treatment.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>

<EMPH weight="bold">
What does 'Doralese' do?
</EMPH>
  As the prostate gland gets bigger, it presses on the urethra making it more difficult to pass urine.  'Doralese' relaxes the muscles in the prostate, helping to improve urine flow.  It can be used for patients who do not need or want an operation, and also for patients waiting for an operation.

If I am taking any other medicines, will 'Doralese' affect them?

  You must not take the antidepressants called MAOls (mono-amine oxidase inhibitors) at the same time as taking 'Doralese' so check with your doctor before you start.
