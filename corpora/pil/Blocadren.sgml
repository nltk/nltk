How do your tablets work?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
The active ingredient in your tablets is timolol maleate. This belongs to a group of medicines known as beta-adrenergic-receptor blockers, or beta-blockers. These medicines work by blocking the effect of normal body chemicals, such as adrenaline, which may abnormally increase heart rate and activity and raise blood pressure. Timolol maleate reduces heart rate and activity, and lowers blood pressure. Beta-blockers are also useful in preventing migraine headaches.
