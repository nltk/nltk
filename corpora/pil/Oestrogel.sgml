Progestogen tablets:
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Unless you have had a hysterectomy, your doctor will have prescribed a progestogen tablet to be taken while receiving Oestrogel medication . Take the tablets as instructed by your doctor. It is best to take the tablet either just before or just after applying Oestrogel. While you are using both Oestrogel and a progestogen you may have a period towards the end of the treatment with progestogen tablets, this is quite normal. You may find it helpful to tick off each day on the enclosed calendar. This will assist you in keeping a record of your medication and remind you when the next course of tablets is due.
