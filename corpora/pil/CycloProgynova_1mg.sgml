What &quot;the change of life&quot; means
</EMPH>
 &quot;The change of life&quot; (also known as &quot;the climacteric&quot;) is a gradual process. which usually takes place between the ages of about 45 and 55 The periods usually become irregular, both in timing and amount of bleeding, before they stop altogether, but the time at which the periods finally stop - &quot;the menopause&quot; - is not the end of the change of life, which always continues for some time afterwards. Although the change of life is natural, it often causes distressing symptoms These symptoms are due to the gradual loss of the female sex hormones produced by the ovaries.

Cyclo-Progynova 1 mg contains both types of hormone that are lost during the change of life: oestrogen and progestogen. Therefore, it replaces the hormones that the body no longer makes, and prevents or relieves the troublesome symptoms. Cyclo-Progynova 1 mg can control heavy or irregular periods, and is likely to produce regular monthly bleeding even if you have already passed the menopause. Cyclo-Progynova 1 mg will not make you able to have children, but, on the other hand, if you are still fertile, Cyclo-Progynova 1 mg will not prevent pregnancy.

Cyclo-Progynova 1 mg is not an oral contraceptive
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
It is important to note that Cyclo-Progynova 1 mg is not an oral contraceptive if you still have the ability to become pregnant, Cyclo-Progynova 1 mg is unlikely to alter it. If you are taking contraceptive precautions other than oral (or other hormonal) contraceptives when you start Cyclo-Progynova 1 mg, continue to do so until your doctor tells you that you no longer require contraceptive protection. If you have been taking an oral (or other hormonal) contraceptive, you must change to an alternative (non-hormonal) form of contraception before starting Cyclo-Progynova 1 mg. On the other hand, your doctor has already advised you that you need no longer use any contraceptive you need not do so while taking Cyclo-Progynova 1 mg, despite the fact that you again have regular monthly bleeding.
