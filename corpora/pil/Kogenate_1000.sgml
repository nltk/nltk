What does KOGENATE contain?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
KOGENATE is a freeze-dried powder which contains 1000 International Units (IU) of Factor VIII (rDNA) (bhk).
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
It contains also human albumin, glycine, calcium chloride and 18 mg of sodium chloride. KOGENATE must be dissolved in the Water for Injections supplied before it is administered.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
This box contains one 10 ml vial of freeze-dried KOGENATE powder.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
You should have received another box connected to this box which contains:
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
One 10 ml vial containing 2.5 ml of Water for Injections.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Two sterile alcohol swabs for single use.

<BLOCK>
The vial will appear to be only partially full but this is normal and does not mean that it contains the wrong amount of powder.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
KOGENATE 1000 contains Factor VlIl and is to be used to stop and/or prevent the bleeding you get with haemophilia A.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The Factor VlIl in KOGENATE is made by the process of genetic engineering as indicated by the initials (rDNA) (bhk) used above.

Why have I been prescribed KOGENATE by my doctor?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
KOGENATE has been prescribed by your doctor to stop and/or prevent the bleeding you might get with haemophilia A.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Haemophilia A is a disease which results because your body does not produce enough Factor VlIl.  Factor VlIl is a component in the blood which helps it to clot when you are bleeding.  If the level of Factor VlIl is low in your blood, your body will have difficulty in stopping bleeding.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
You can use KOGENATE if you have never been treated for haemophilia before, or if you have previously been treated for haemophilia and have no antibodies to Factor VlIl (inhibitors) which would neutralise Factor VlIl in your blood.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you have been using KOGENATE and you develop Factor VlIl inhibitors, treatment may be continued as long as you still respond to KOGENATE and the inhibitors in your blood remain below a certain level (10 Bethesda Units).  Speak to your doctor if you would like further information about this.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
This product does not contain von Willebrand Factor, so it cannot be used in von Willebrand’s disease.

When should I not use KOGENATE 1000?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Do not use KOGENATE if you are allergic to any of the ingredients.  If you are unsure about this, ask your doctor.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you know that you are allergic to mouse or hamster protein, KOGENATE should not be used.  Consult your doctor if you are unsure about this.  Usually, if you are allergic to KOGENATE, a reaction will occur upon first use of the product.  Allergic reactions can occur at the injection site such as a burning sensation, temporary redness or a rash or you may experience nausea, dizziness or a tight chest.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>
<DIV type=2>

<HEAD slant="italic"  weight="bold" >
What special precautions should I take?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
If you think that you are having an allergic reaction to KOGENATE, stop administering the product immediately and seek medical advice.  Speak to your doctor regularly about your treatment.  He/she may wish to carry out tests to ensure that your current dose of KOGENATE is sufficient to reach and maintain adequate Factor VlIl levels.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If your bleeding is not being controlled with KOGENATE, consult your doctor immediately.  You may have developed Factor VlIl inhibitors and your doctor may wish to carry out tests to confirm this.  Factor VlIl inhibitors are antibodies in the blood which act against the Factor VlIl you are using.  This makes the Factor VlIl less effective in controlling bleeding.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you are pregnant, planning a family or are breast-feeding, tell your doctor before using this product.  If you have informed your doctor already, follow his/her instructions carefully.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
There is no evidence that Factor VlIl may impair your ability to drive or to use machines.

<HEAD slant="italic"  weight="bold" >
How much KOGENATE 1000 should I use?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
The amount of KOGENATE you use and how often you use it depends on many factors such as your weight, the severity of your haemophilia, the site and extent of bleeding, the amount of Factor VlIl inhibitors that you may have and the Factor VIII level required.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Your doctor will calculate the dose of KOGENATE and the frequency you should use it to get the necessary level of Factor VlIl activity in your blood.  He will do this according to 
<EMPH uline="plain">
your
</EMPH>
 particular needs using the formulae below.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
I)To determine the dose required for a given response:
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Required IU = body weight (kg) x desired Factor VlIl rise (% of normal) x 0 5
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
II)To determine the response expected from a given dose:
</BLOCK>


</DIV>

</DIV>
<DIV type=1>

<HEAD>
Expected Factor VlIl rise (% of normal) = 2 x administered IU body weight (kg)
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
If you are infusing KOGENATE to stop a bleeding episode, the amount of KOGENATE you will need depends on the site and extent of your bleeding.  For example, if you are suffering a minor haemorrhage, such as bleeding into a joint, the plasma level of Factor VlIl activity should not fall below 30 % of normal for at least one day.  If your bleeding is more severe or you need an operation, the dose of KOGENATE and time of usage will increase.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you are using KOGENATE to prevent bleeding (PROPHYLAXIS), your doctor will calculate the dose for you.  This will usually be in the range of 10 to 50 IU of KOGENATE per kg of body weight administered at intervals of 2 to 3 days.  However, in some cases, especially younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you have a large number of Factor VlIl inhibitors, the dose of KOGENATE you are given by your doctor will be high to maintain the correct Factor VlIl activity in your blood.  If this dose does not control your bleeding your doctor may consider the use of an additional product (activated) prothrombin complex concentrate.  Speak to your doctor if you would like further information about this.

Without opening either vial, warm the KOGENATE powder and the Water for Injections to room temperature.  This can be done by taking the vials from the fridge and allowing them to stand in a room for approximately one hour or, if needed to treat a bleed sooner, the vials can be warmed by holding them in your hands.
