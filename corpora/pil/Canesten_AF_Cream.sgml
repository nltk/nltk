What is Athlete's Foot?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Athlete's foot is the common name for the fungal infection Tinea pedis.  It is caused by a group of fungi called dermatophytes.  The name "athlete's foot" arose because this is an infection which is commonly, although not exclusively, suffered by people whose feet perspire or who use communal changing rooms.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Athlete's foot is highly contagious and infected skin shed on changing room floors or on towels can easily transfer the infection.  The discomfort caused by the infection can be made worse by wearing shoes, particularly if they are made from synthetic materials which do not allow the feet to "breathe".  The key triggers of athlete's foot include warmth, moisture and friction.  The latter can damage the tissue allowing the fungus to take hold.
