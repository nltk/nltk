ABOUT THE TABLETS
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Mifegyne tablets contain 200mg of a medicine called mifepristone.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The tablets also contain the following ingredients: anhydrous colloidal silica, maize starch, povidone, microcrystalline cellulose and magnesium stearate. The UK product licence for Mifegyne is held by Roussel Laboratories Limited, Uxbridge, UB9 5HP. The product is manufactured in France by Roussel Uclaf, Compi&egrave;gne.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Mifegyne acts by blocking the effects of progesterone a hormone which is needed for pregnancy to continue. Mifegyne also softens and dilates the opening to the womb. Mifegyne is used prior to surgical termination of pregnancy.
</BLOCK>

<DIV type=1>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
THE TREATMENT

<BLOCK>
The treatment will consist of three Mifegyne tablets which will be taken in the presence of your doctor. This will be followed within 2 days by a surgical procedure which will terminate the pregnancy. Your doctor will explain this to you.

WHAT IF I CHANGE MY MIND ABOUT THE TERMINATION?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Once you have taken the Mifegyne tablets you should be aware that changing your mind would be inadvisable as there is a risk that if the pregnancy continues the baby may be born with abnormalities. This should be discussed with your doctor.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
In the unlikely event of the treatment failing, you should consult your doctor at your follow-up visit about the need to terminate the pregnancy by another method.
</BLOCK>

<DIV type=1>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF TREATMENT?
</HEAD>


<LIST type="bulleted">

<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
after taking the Mifegyne tablets nothing much will happen for about 12 hours. You may feel unwell, perhaps a little faint or sick during the first few hours. You may suffer from a headache or have a skin rash.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
after 12 hours you may start to bleed, the chances of this happening will depend on how advanced your pregnancy is. About a half of the women who have taken the treatment started to bleed in the two days before coming back to hospital. The bleeding may be quite heavy, like a heavy period, you may also get cramps like period pains.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
a small number of women may also develop some infection. The doctor needs to check if this has happened and give antibiotic treatment if needed.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>

</LIST>



<BLOCK>
If you have a lot of pain the doctor will be able to give you some pain killers such as paracetamol or codeine. Pain can be worse in women who have never been pregnant before or who normally suffer from painful periods.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you think you are reacting badly in any of these or any other ways to your medicine, talk to your nurse or doctor straight away.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>

<EMPH weight="bold">
