What this medicine is used for
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Anturan is used to treat gout. Gout is caused by too much uric acid in the blood. This medicine works by removing the extra uric acid from the body. It does not cure gout but may help to prevent gout attacks. Your doctor may also prescribe Anturan for other conditions caused by too much uric acid in the blood.
