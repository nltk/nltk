<BLOCK>
Imigran tablets contain sumatriptan, the first of a new group of medicines developed for the treatment of migraine. The symptoms of migraine may be due to swollen blood vessels around the brain. Medicines like Imigran probably work by reducing the size of these blood vessels and are called 5HT1 agonists.
