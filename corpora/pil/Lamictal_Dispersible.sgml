Taking the medicine
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
It is important that the medicine is taken as directed by a doctor. The label should tell you how much should be taken and how often. If it doesn't or if you are not sure, ask a doctor or pharmacist.
</BLOCK>


<LIST type="bulleted">

<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
The usual dosage is one or two tablets twice a day, but the starting dose may be much lower for the first 2 to 4 weeks.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
A tablet can either be chewed or can be dissolved to make a liquid medicine.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
If the tablet is chewed, the patient may need to drink a little water at the same time. This is because the tablet needs water when dissolving in the mouth. A little more water should then be sipped to make sure all of the medicine is swallowed.

 To make a liquid medicine, add the tablet to a little water, in a glass. Use enough water to cover the whole tablet. Leave for about a minute, until the tablet has fully dissolved, and then give all of the liquid. Add a little more water to the glass and give this to make sure all of the medicine has been taken.
