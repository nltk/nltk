<BLOCK>
The Spacer Inhaler makes it easier to inhale Bricanyl because the spacer chamber slows down the speed of the aerosol mist, so that it can be more easily breathed into the lungs,  where it acts.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
To make it easier to carry, the Spacer Inhaler can be folded up, like a telescope.  To assemble the Spacer Inhaler correctly and stop it folding up in use, you must follow the  instructions carefully.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>

<EMPH weight="bold">
Note:  
</EMPH>
When the Spacer Inhaler is correctly used you will not feel the cold spray hitting the mouth or throat.  This means that more of the spray is reaching your lungs.
