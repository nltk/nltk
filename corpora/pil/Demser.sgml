How do your capsules work?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
The active ingredient in your capsules is metirosine. Metirosine inhibits an enzyme called tyrosine hydroxylase which is important in the production of certain hormones including adrenaline and noradrenaline. These hormones are naturally occurring chemicals in your body and are involved in the control of heart rate and blood pressure. In certain diseases, where adrenaline and noradrenaline are produced in abnormally high levels, treatment with metirosine is used to reduce these amounts.

Why do you need to take these capsules?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Your doctor has prescribed Demser for you to treat a condition known as phaeochromocytoma, which .,e will probably have explained to you. Phaeochromocytoma is a tumour which usually occurs near the kidney, and secretes the hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline. The increased levels of these hormones, if left untreated, may cause high blood pressure and increase your risk of stroke, heart attack and damage to your kidneys.

<BLOCK>
Demser should not be given to children under 12 years of age.
</BLOCK>

Demser is not suitable for the treatment of ordinary high blood pressure or 'essential hypertension'.

How should you take Demser?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
You must take your capsules by mouth exactly as advised by your doctor or pharmacist. The number of capsules you take each day will depend on your condition. For many people the initial dose is 1 capsule four times a day, which may be increased by 1 or 2 capsules daily. The dosage range is usually 8-12 capsules a day. When 'Demser' is given before an operation, the optimum dose range should be given for five to seven days before surgery.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Your doctor will probably monitor your condition regularly by carrying out laboratory tests on urine and, possibly, blood samples.

Slight swelling of hands or feet, and skin rashes, have occurred rarely.
