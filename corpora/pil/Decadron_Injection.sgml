</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>

Why do you need to take this medicine?

<BLOCK>
Corticosteroids are given to patients for a variety of conditions where their abilities to reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system are valuable. These conditions may include Crohn's disease, asthma, shock, anaphylaxis, tuberculosis, arthritis, osteoarthritis, and skin disorders including acne. Decadron Injection is usually given to patients unable to take a tablet form of the medicine. Your doctor will be able to explain your condition more fully.

How should Decadron Injection be given?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
You should have been given, or are about to be given Decadron Injection by a healthcare professional. The medicine will be given as an injection either into a muscle or vein, or may be given as an intravenous infusion.

The usual initial dose ranges from 0.5 mg-20 mg (0.125 ml-5 ml) per day, with repeat dosing depending on your condition.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
For some patients the medicine may be given as an injection into the painful area itself, usually once every three to five days or once every 2-3 weeks depending on your response.
