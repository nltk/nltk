 The usual recommended dose is as follows:
</BLOCK>


<LIST type="bulleted">

<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
2 x 800mg tablets a day taken as a single dose

or
</EMPH>

</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
in two divided doses of 1 x 800mg tablet per dose.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>

</LIST>



<BLOCK>
However your doctor may prescribe up to 4 x 800mg tablets a day.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Do not take more than the doctor has prescribed.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
In the event of an overdosage consult a doctor immediately.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Swallow the tablets whole with a little liquid, but 
<EMPH uline="plain">
NOT
</EMPH>
 with milk.  Take the tablets at least 1 hour before or 1 hour after food.  The best time to take a single daily dose of Bonefos is last thing at night before you go to bed.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If BONEFOS TABLETS are taken with milk or with food, it is more difficult for them to enter your blood stream and so you will not get the full benefit of your medicine.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
For the same reasons, DO NOT take BONEFOS TABLETS with mineral supplements as these may also reduce the effectiveness of your medicine.  Make sure that you drink a lot of fluid e.g water or diluted squash throughout your treatment with BONEFOS TABLETS.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>

<EMPH weight="bold">
DO NOT STOP TAKING THIS MEDICINE EXCEPT ON YOUR DOCTOR’S ADVICE.
</EMPH>

</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>

<EMPH weight="bold">
If you forget to take your medicine,
</EMPH>
 do not worry – just take the next dose at the usual time.

After Taking Your Medicine
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
All medicines sometimes cause side effects.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
A few people experience upset stomachs, for example sickness and diarrhoea after taking BONEFOS TABLETS.  If you do experience any such symptoms they may improve if you follow the divided dose recommendations (i e. take half the number of tablets in the morning and the remaining half in the evening).  Skin reactions, such as rash, redness or itching have also been reported.  These effects are usually mild, however, if they persist or become troublesome consult your doctor.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Unwanted effects on the kidneys have been reported.  This appears to be more common in patients receiving non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as diclofenac, although no definite association has been established.  Your doctor will periodically carry out tests during treatment to ensure that your kidneys are working properly.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you experience any other effects not mentioned above, consult your doctor.
