Important Information you should know about PERGONAL
</EMPH>
 PERGONAL may cause pain and soreness at the injection site; on occasions fever and joint pains occur
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Some patients have had allergic type reactions (rash, itching, etc.) possibly due to the lactose which is in the medicine. Tell your doctor if you think you might be allergic to the medicine.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
A condition called ovarian hyperstimulation can occur This is when the ovaries overreact to the treatment. Your doctor will carry out tests, such as ultrasound, to minimise the chance of this occurring. This condition can cause various symptoms to occur. The most common is abdominal (stomach) pain If this happens, speak to the nurse or doctor responsible for your treatment as soon as you can. If you are injecting PERGONAL yourself then 
<EMPH weight="bold">
do not
</EMPH>
 give any more injections until you have spoken to the nurse or doctor. The doctor will then decide whether or not to continue the treatment cycle. If you have to stop treatment you will be asked not to have sexual intercourse, and usually you will just have to rest. Rarely, the condition can be severe and you may need to be in hospital.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Sometimes multiple pregnancies occur following treatment. The majority of these are twins. It is very rare to have a large number of babies at the same time due to treatment with PERGONAL
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
There have been reports of ectopic pregnancies (a pregnancy where the embryo has implanted outside the womb} in women undergoing assisted conception techniques (e g. IVF). This has not been shown to be due to treatment with PERGONAL .
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Pregnancy loss (miscarriage) in women undergoing assisted conception techniques is higher than normal but much ! the same as the rates found in women with other fertility problems.
