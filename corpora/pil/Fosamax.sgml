How do your tablets work?

Why do you need to take Fosamax?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Your doctor has prescribed Fosamax because you have a disease called osteoporosis.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Osteoporosis is a thinning and weakening of the bones that is common in post-menopausal women. Following the menopause, the ovaries stop producing the female hormone, oestrogen. At this time, bone loss occurs and bones become weaker. The earlier a woman reaches the menopause, the greater the risk of osteoporosis.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Early on, osteoporosis usually has no symptoms. If left untreated, however, it can result in fractures (broken bones). Although fractures usually cause pain, fractures of the bones of the spine may go unnoticed until they cause height loss. Fractures may occur during normal, everyday activity, such as lifting, or from minor injury that would not be sufficient to fracture normal bone. Fractures usually occur at the hip, spine, or wrist and can lead not only to pain but also to considerable deformity and disability (such as stooped posture, or 'dowager's hump', and loss of mobility).
</BLOCK>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
How can osteoporosis be treated?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
It is important to remember that osteoporosis can be treated and that it is never too late to begin. Your doctor has prescribed Fosamax to treat your osteoporosis. Fosamax not only prevents the loss of bone but actually helps to rebuild bone.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
In addition to your treatment with Fosamax, your doctor may recommend that you make some changes to your lifestyle which should help your condition. These are:
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>

<EMPH slant = "italic">
Stopping smoking
</EMPH>
. Smoking appears to increase the rate at which you lose bone and, therefore, may increase your risk of fracture.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>

<EMPH slant = "italic">
Exercise
</EMPH>
. Like muscles, bones need exercise to stay strong and healthy. Consult your doctor before you begin any exercise programme.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Eating a balanced diet. Your doctor can advise you <CB n=2> about your diet or whether you should take any dietary supplements.
