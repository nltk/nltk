Skelid is used to treat Paget's disease of bone. Normal bone is continually built up, removed and replaced. In Paget's disease this process happens too quickly and the new bone produced is weaker than normal. The affected bone may become enlarged and can be painful. Skelid controls this process.

What is Paget's Disease7
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Paget's disease is a common condition of the bone, most often seen in middle ayed or elderly people. It affects approximately one in 20 people over the age of 55 years: although most have no symptoms, these may develop with time.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Bone is constantly being broken down and rebuilt. In Paget's disease, this process happens too quickly. This over-activity is confined to small areas of the bones and does not affect the whole skeleton. Bones affected by Paget's disease become weakened and enlarged, in turn they may become misshapen or painful. When the skull is affected, Paget's disease may cause deafness; elsewhere in the body osteoarthritis may develop.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>
<DIV type=1>

<HEAD>
Why has your doctor prescribed treatment for you7
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
The aim of treatment is to control the over activity of the bone. To get the greatest benefit from this treatment you should take the full course of tablets in the way your doctor told you.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Your doctor may wish to see you some time after you finish this course of treatment. Even though you may feel well, you should keep this appointment so that your doctor can monitor your progress.
