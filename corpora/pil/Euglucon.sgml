HOW SHOULD YOU TAKE YOUR MEDICINE?
</EMPH>

<BLOCK>
Always take the number of tablets your doctor has asked you to take. At first this will be half a tablet or a single one. This will usually be taken once a day.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you are changing the type of medicine used to treat your diabetes, your doctor will give you instructions. To start with you may have to take both types together.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Your doctor may increase your dose if the blood sugar level does not come down enough. You should not take more than your doctor tells you.

WHAT IF YOU TAKE TOO MANY?

If you take too many tablets by accident, you must take 3-4 sugar lumps dissolved in water to balance the effect of the tablets. You can repeat this if you feel it is necessary after 15 minutes. If you still feel unwell, consult your doctor straight away.

<HEAD weight="bold" >
WHAT IF YOU MISS A DOSE?

<BLOCK>
It is very important that you do not miss a dose. You should try not to miss any tablets, since high blood sugar can cause problems. If you do miss one, take it as soon as possible with food. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and carry on as normal. Do not take an extra tablet to make up.

WHAT ABOUT SIDE EFFECTS?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Like all medicines, Euglucon may cause you some problems. These are rare, and usually minor, for example tummy upsets, slight sickness, decreased appetite (anorexia) or diarrhoea, and usually disappear with time. Your skin may feel itchy and develop a rash.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Sometimes people taking Euglucon may find that they feel more tired and unwell than usual. Others may notice that they bruise or bleed more easily if they cut themselves. Please tell your doctor if you notice any of these effects. Your doctor may want to perform regular blood tests to monitor your medical condition. If this is so, do not worry, it is just routine.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Very rarely, people have become jaundiced (yellowing of the skin) or developed liver problems such as hepatitis during treatment with Euglucon. If you notice this, stop taking the tablets, tell your doctor immediately.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you have any other problems and think that your medicine may be causing them, tell your doctor or pharmacist.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>

<EMPH weight="bold">
NOTE:
</EMPH>
 light-headedness, a pounding heart, clamminess or sweaty palms may mean that your blood sugar is too low and the dose of Euglucon is not right for you.
