How your medicine works
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) is one of a group of medicines known as corticosteroids which helps in the management of asthma.  Beclomethasone dipropionate works by reducing swelling and irritation in the walls of the small air passages in your lungs.  This type of medicine is known as a ‘PREVENTER’.  As it is used to prevent asthma attacks it is important to use your inhaler regularly even when you have no symptoms or you feel better.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
It may take a few days for this medicine to work.  Do not stop taking your inhaler unless told to do so by a doctor.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
You may currently be using an inhaler which acts to open your airways during an asthma attack (a ’RELIEVER’).  This can be safely used together with your BDP Spacehaler.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
IMPORTANT: Do not use this inhaler to provide relief from wheezing or breathlessness.  You will probably need a different kind of medicine in a different colour pack which your doctor may already have given you.
