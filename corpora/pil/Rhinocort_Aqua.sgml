TAKING YOUR MEDICINE Operating instructions
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Before using Rhinocort Aqua nasal spray for the first time shake the bottle and pump several times (5 - 10 times) into the air so that a uniform mist is obtained (see picture).
</BLOCK>

<CB n=1>

<BLOCK>
The loading effect remains for approximately 24 hours.  If a longer period of time passes before the next dose is taken, the pump must be loaded again.  This time it is sufficient to pump just once (1) into the air.

It is important to take your medicine at the right times.  You must take it as directed by your doctor.  The label will tell you how much to take and how often.  Usually this will be once a day or sometimes twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening.  If you forget to take a dose take one as soon as you remember and then carry on as before.  If it is very close to the next dose time before you remember, wait until then.  Rhinocort Aqua may take a few days before the full effect can be felt.
</BLOCK>

<CB n=2>

<BLOCK>
During this time the symptoms of hay fever or rhinitis should become less. 
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
You may notice that at first you will sneeze soon after the spray is used.  This is because the lining of the nose is very sensitive.  This does not happen after the first few doses.  This medicine can sometimes cause side-effects in some people.  If you get slight bleeding from your nose or if you notice anything else unusual when using Rhinocort Aqua, tell your doctor.
