AFTER TAKING YOUR MEDICINE
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
What unwanted side effects might it have?  A few people may find that Co-danthrusate gives them a mild griping feeling.  If this happens, the symptoms are usually mild.  If you suffer badly, tell your doctor.  A few people find that they get an orange tint in their urine.  This is due to the danthron in Co-danthrusate and is not a cause for concern.  Tell your doctor if you develop any unusual problems while taking this medicine. If your doctor decides to stop the treatment, return any left-over medicine to the pharmacist.
