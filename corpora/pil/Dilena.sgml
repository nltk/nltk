What this medicine is used for

How this medicine works
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Dilena contains an oestrogen (oestradiol valerate) and a progestogen (medroxyprogesterone acetate). Oestrogens are mainly produced by the ovaries. They are necessary for the normal sexual development of women and to regulate the menstrual cycle during the child bearing years. When women get older the ovaries gradually produce less oestrogen. The period in which this happens (usually around the age of 50) is called the climacteric or menopause. If the ovaries are removed surgically (oopherectomy) before the menopause, the decrease in oestrogen production occurs very abruptly. Shortage of oestrogen leads to complaints such as hot flushes and night sweating. The vaginal wall may become thin and dry, so sexual intercourse may be painful. Vaginal infections can also occur. Some women feel depressed and lose their sex drive. These complaints can often be relieved by using medicines containing oestrogen such as Dilena.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The blue tablets contain a progestogen to give you a regular monthly bleed.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The shortage of oestrogen may cause thinning of bones (osteoporosis). Other factors that contribute to osteoporosis are early menopause, family history of osteoporosis, recent corticosteroid therapy, a small body frame, thinness and cigarette smoking. Over the years the bones become brittle and break easily. Dilena can also prevent osteoporosis.
