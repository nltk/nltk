Q.What is this medicine for?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
A.Ecostatin Cream is for the treatment of skin infections, which are caused by yeasts, fungi and certain bacteria. These include ringworm, athlete's foot, fungal nappy rash and pityriasis versicolor (small pink spots on the trunk and limbs). The cream can also be used to treat infections of the external genitals, beneath the breasts, around the nails, in the groin and armpits. This medicine works by killing the yeast, fungus or bacterium that has caused your symptoms. Therefore, it stops any itching, soreness or redness.
