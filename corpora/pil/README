http://mcs.open.ac.uk/nlg/old_projects/pills/corpus/

This directory contains text extracted from version 2.0 of the Patient
Information Leaflet corpus, a collection of 471 documents giving
instructions to patients about their medication. The corpus was
originally created from the ABPI compendium of patient information
leaflets by manual scanning and conversion.

The PIL corpus was initially developed as part of the ICONOCLAST
project, supported by the EPSRC (grant no L77102), and is distributed
with permission.
