You and the pill How your body gets ready for pregnancy (the menstrual cycle)
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
You can usually become pregnant (conceive) from when you start to have periods, up until you are in your late 40s. Every menstrual cycle takes about 28 days. About halfway through this cycle an egg is released from one of your ovaries into a fallopian tube. This is called ovulation.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The egg travels down the fallopian tube towards your womb. When you make love, your partner's penis releases millions of sperm into your vagina. Some of these sperm travel up through your womb into your fallopian tubes. If there is an egg in one of these tubes, and a sperm reaches it, you can become pregnant. This is called 'conception'.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
A fertilised egg gets embedded in the lining of your womb and takes 9 months to grow into a baby. As an egg can live for up to 2 days, and sperm for up to 5 days you can become pregnant if you have made love up to 5 days before ovulation and for some time afterwards. If a sperm does not fertilise an egg, the egg is lost at the end of the menstrual cycle with the lining of your womb. This is called a 'period'.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>
<DIV type=1>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
How do natural hormones work?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Your menstrual cycle is controlled by two sex hormones made by your ovaries: one called oestrogen, the other progesterone (a progestogen). Oestrogen increases during the first half of your menstrual cycle and makes your womb develop a thick lining, ready to receive the egg if conception happens. Progesterone comes later in the cycle and changes the lining of the womb still further to prepare it for pregnancy.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you do not become pregnant, you make less of these hormones and this causes the lining of your womb to break down and the lining leaves your body as a period. But during pregnancy, your ovaries, and then the placenta (this attaches the growing baby to the womb and gives it food), carry on making progesterone and oestrogen to stop any more eggs being released.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>
<DIV type=1>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
How does the pill work?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
There are two types of pill, the combined pill and the progestogen-only pill. A combined pill contains two hormones which are like those your body produces (oestrogen and progestogen).
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Neogest is a 
<EMPH weight="bold">
progestogen-only pill
</EMPH>
 which contains only progestogen and no oestrogen.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Neogest works by thickening the fluid (mucus) in the neck of your womb (cervix) which makes it more difficult for sperm to enter the womb. It also changes the lining of your womb so that it does not thicken enough for an egg to grow in it. In some women it also stops the ovary releasing an egg each month (ovulation).
</BLOCK>


</DIV>
<DIV type=1>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
How effective is Neogest?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Progestogen-only pills, such as Neogest, are not quite as effective as combined oral contraceptives. However, Neogest provides a very high degree of protection against pregnancy.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
To make Neogest as effective as it can be you must take it regularly, and at the same time each day. You must follow your doctor's instructions and take the tablets exactly as it says in this leaflet.

What does Neogest contain?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Each pack of Neogest contains 35 dark brown, sugar-coated tablets. Each tablet contains 75 micrograms of norgestrel. Norgestrel is one of a group of substances called progestogens, which is similar to a hormone progesterone, that is produced naturally by women.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Neogest also contains the following inactive ingredients: lactose, maize starch, povidone, polyethylene glycol 6000, calcium carbonate (E170), talc, magnesium stearate (E572), sucrose, montan glycol wax, titanium dioxide (E171), glycerin (E422), brown ferric oxide (E172).
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Each pack of Neogest contains a memo strip of 35 tablets.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Neogest is a progestogen-only contraceptive pill. Progestogen-only contraceptives contain one female type of hormone, a progestogen.

What you should know before taking Neogest
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Before you start taking Neogest your pelvic organs breasts and blood pressure should be checked by your doctor and these checks should be repeated regularly. The doctor will also make sure you are not pregnant.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Diabetes (diabetes mellitus) or a tendency towards diabetes needs watching carefully while you are taking the pill.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you have had an ectopic pregnancy (where the foetus develops somewhere other than the womb), or one of your fallopian tubes is missing, you should discuss this with your doctor before using Neogest.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you have an irregular menstrual pattern together with stomach pains whilst taking Neogest, you should see your doctor.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>
<DIV type=1>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
Taking other medicines with Neogest
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Some medicines may stop Neogest from working properly. If you are taking any other medicine while you are taking Neogest, be sure to tell your doctor (or dentist). Your doctor (or dentist) can tell you whether you should use extra contraceptive precautions and for how long.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Medicines which can sometimes stop Neogest from working properly are antibiotics (such as ampicillin and rifampicin); griseofulvin (which is used to treat fungal infections); phenylbutazone (which is used as an anti-inflammatory drug to treat some types of joint <PB n=2> <CB n=1> diseases); phenytoin, primidone, phenobarbitone and some other medicines used in people with epilepsy, and carbamazepine (which can be used to treat epilepsy or other illnesses).
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you are taking any of these medicines you might still be able to use Neogest, but you will also need to use an extra contraceptive method (condoms or cap plus spermicide} while you are taking the other medicine and for 14 days after you stop taking it. If you are taking griseofulvin, phenylbutazone, phenytoin, primidone, phenobarbitone, carbamazepine or other drugs to treat epilepsy for a long time you may not be able to use Neogest. Check with your doctor, pharmacist, or Family Planning clinic.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you are taking rifampicin you will need to use another method of contraception as well as Neogest. You should do this while you are taking the rifampicin and for 4 weeks after you stop.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you are diabetic your doctor may alter the dose of medicine required to treat your diabetes.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you are in doubt check with your doctor, pharmacist or Family Planning clinic.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>
<DIV type=1>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
Stomach upsets
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Being sick or having very bad diarrhoea may stop Neogest from working properly and make it less effective. Carry on taking Neogest as usual, and also use another method of contraception (condom or cap plus spermicide) until 14 days after you have recovered from the stomach upset. If your stomach upset continues for some time, consult your doctor who may consider another form of contraception.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you are sick (vomit) very soon after taking your pill, you can take another pill within 3 hours of the normal time and you will then have contraceptive protection (as long as you are not sick again). You can use the last pill in the pack for this purpose. If you have repeated vomiting use an extra method of contraception as described above.
</BLOCK>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
Warnings
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
It has been suggested, on the basis of statistical evidence, that the risk of developing various disorders of the circulation of the blood is slightly greater in women who take the pill than in those who do not. This can lead to, for example, deep vein thrombosis (blood clot in the leg), strokes (blood clots and haemorrhages from the blood vessels of the brain), heart attacks or pulmonary embolism (blood clots blocking the arteries of the lungs). People do not always fully recover from these disorders, and, very rarely, they are fatal. However, such associations are less clear with progestogen-only pills.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Certain conditions increase the risk of thrombosis. They include:
</BLOCK>


<LIST type="bulleted">

<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
smoking.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
obesity.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
some diseases of the heart and blood vessels.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
diabetes.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>

</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
a major operation or period of immobilisation (e.g. you are in bed after an accident or operation or you have a plaster cast on a broken leg).
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
if any members of your family have suffered from thromboembolic diseases (e.g. deep vein thrombosis, stroke or heart attack) at a young age.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
varicose veins.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>

</LIST>



<BLOCK>
If any of these conditions apply to you before you decide to take Neogest or while you are taking Neogest you must discuss them with your doctor.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The risk of arterial thrombosis (e.g. heart attack and stroke) associated with the pill increases with age, and this risk is increased by cigarette smoking.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Signs and symptoms of blood clots are given in the section "Reasons for stopping Neogest immediately".
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
On rare occasions, the use of the pill has led to liver diseases such as jaundice and benign liver tumours, and, very rarely, it has been associated with some forms of malignant liver tumours (cancer) in long-term users. Liver tumours may lead to life-threatening intra-abdominal haemorrhage (bleeding in the abdomen). Therefore, if you have pain in the upper <CB n=2> abdomen that does not soon clear up, tell your doctor.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Also, if your skin becomes yellow (jaundice) you must tell your doctor.
</BLOCK>
