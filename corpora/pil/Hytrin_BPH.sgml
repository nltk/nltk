WHAT IS HYTRIN BPH FOR?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Hytrin BPH may be used for the treatment of a condition called benign prostate hyperplasia which is common in older men. This condition is caused by the prostate gland growing too big and obstructing the f low of urine from the bladder.  This leads to some unpleasant symptoms such as weak or interrupted urine flow, a need to pass water more frequently and/or a sudden need to pass water.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Hytrin BPH can relax the muscle of the prostate gland and bladder exit to help relieve these symptoms.
