WHEN SHOULD I USE CANESTEN 100MG
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
PESSARIES?
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The pessaries should be used to treat vaginal thrush .
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Vaginal thrush (candidiasis) is a common infection caused by a fungus which may live harmlessly in the vagina without you even noticing it.  However, in certain circumstances it may develop into an infection in the vagina and the symptoms may spread to the surrounding area (the vulva).
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The common symptoms of thrush are:
</BLOCK>


<LIST type="bulleted">

<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
itching of the vagina and vulva
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
redness and swelling of the tissues of the vagina and vulva
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
soreness of the vagina
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
a white non-smelling discharge from the vagina
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>

</LIST>



<BLOCK>
Not everybody who has thrush has all of these symptoms.  You may have only one of them.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If this is the first time you have had these symptoms, talk to your doctor before using any treatment.
</BLOCK>

</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
CREAM?
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The cream should be used to soothe and relieve the irritation of the vulva (vulvitis) which is caused by thrush.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
It can also be used for the treatment of irritation of the end of the penis (glans) which is caused by thrush.  If the cream is used to treat your sexual partner at the same time as your own treatment, it can help prevent re-infection and so reduce the frequency of your attacks of thrush.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Canesten 1% cream can also be used to treat fungal skin infections such as ringworm, athlete’s foot, fungal nappy rash and fungal infection of the breast fold (intertrigo).
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
WHEN SHOULD I NOT USE CANESTEN 100mg PESSARIES AND CANESTEN 1% CREAM?
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Do not use the pessaries or cream if you have previously had an allergic reaction to the active ingredient clotrimazole.  If you are unsure about this, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
See your doctor as soon as possible and

<BLOCK>
WHAT SIDE-EFFECTS MAY I EXPERIENCE?
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Rarely, Canesten 100 mg Pessaries  may cause side-effects in some people.  The side-effects are very similar to the symptoms of thrush.  If the redness, burning, irritation or swelling get worse, stop using the pessaries and see your doctor as soon as possible.

An allergic reaction may appear as a rash, nausea,  faintness or facial swelling.  If you experience any of these effects, tell your doctor Immediately.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Canesten cream may also cause side-effects in some people.  You may experience a mild burning or irritation immediately after applying the cream.  If you find this intolerable, stop treatment and tell your doctor.

If, upon first use of Canesten cream you experience a rash and itching, tell your doctor immediately as you may be allergic to it.
