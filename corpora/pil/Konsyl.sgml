What is Fiber?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
It is important to know that there are two major categories of dietary fiber: 
<EMPH  weight="bold"  slant = "italic">
soluble and insoluble.
</EMPH>
 
<EMPH  weight="bold"  slant = "italic">
Soluble fiber
</EMPH>
 absorbs water, adds bulk in the stomach, and works throughout the digestive system.  Recent studies have demonstrated that soluble fiber may lower blood cholesterol, thus reducing the risk of heart disease.  Research also suggests that soluble fiber slows the absorption of sugars from the small intestine, which is important for diabetics.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
By contrast, insoluble fiber absorbs little water and adds bulk only in the lower intestine, rather than in the entire digestive tract.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
When a doctor recommends a fiber supplement, it will likely be Ispaghula, a rich source of soluble fiber.
