What is Dovonex Cream for?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Dovonex Cream is used on your skin to treat a certain type of psoriasis (plaque psoriasis). Psoriasis is when your skin cells are being produced too quickly. This causes scaling and redness. Dovonex Cream helps to bring this excessive production of your skin cells back to normal.
