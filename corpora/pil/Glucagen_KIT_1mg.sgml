<BLOCK>
Glucagon is often prescribed for treatment of hypoglycaemia so that close friends or relatives can give the injection if you become hypoglycaemic and are unable to take sugar by mouth. In this case it is important to follow your doctor's instructions on how to give the injection .
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
Follow your doctor's instructions concerning the appropriate dose for treating hypoglycaemia. [The recommended dose for treatment of hypoglycaemia in diabetes (adults and children) is 0.5 to 1 mg (20 microgram/kg)].
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
Following injection of glucagon, carbohydrate must be given (eg glucose tablets or sugar) by mouth as soon as sufficient recovery has taken place. This will restore the stored sugar (glycogen) in the liver, and prevent the blood sugar falling again.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
If recovery has not taken place within 10 minutes of the glucagon injection a doctor must be called immediately so that intravenous glucose can be given.
