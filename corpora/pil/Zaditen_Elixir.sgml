WHY DOES YOUR DOCTOR WANT YOU TO USE ZADITEN?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
In asthma and some allergic conditions, such as rhinitis (inflammation of the mucous membranes in the nose) and conjunctivitis (inflammation of the mucous membranes of the eye), certain substances are released in the body which trigger inflammatory responses (e.g. inflammation of the airways in asthma). 
<EMPH weight="bold">
ZADITEN 
</EMPH>
acts to dampen down this inflammatory response and can, therefore, be used to prevent asthma attacks and treat various allergic conditions.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
It will not stop an asthma attack once it has started.
