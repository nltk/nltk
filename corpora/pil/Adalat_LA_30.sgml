What exactly is high blood pressure?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Blood has to be pumped to all the organs in your body.  This job is done by the heart.  As the blood is pumped around the body, it pushes against the walls of your blood vessels creating pressure.  This is your "blood pressure".  There are upper and lower limits of blood pressure which are generally accepted as normal.  If your blood pressure is greater than the higher limit, it can be detected, even though it's not necessarily causing you any discomfort.  The medical term for this is 
<EMPH weight="bold">
hypertension.
</EMPH>

</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Although high blood pressure may not make you feel ill, it can in the long-term put a strain on your heart because of the extra pumping effort it causes and may lead to other problems such as heart disease or a stroke.

What exactly is angina?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
"Angina" is a pain usually experienced by patients who are suffering from coronary artery disease.  In this disease the arteries supplying blood to the heart become stiffer and their width may be decreased.  This results in less blood getting to the muscle which makes up the largest part of the heart.  The heart is a muscular pump which circulates the blood throughout the whole body.  It needs oxygen to do this and this is supplied by the blood.  If the arteries which supply the muscle of the heart cannot deliver enough oxygen for the heart muscle to work properly, then pain is experienced.  This pain is known as angina.  Usually, angina occurs upon physical exercise and the pain will stop when the exercise stops.  Sometimes, however, it can occur at rest.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Treating angina will reduce the frequency of your anginal attacks.  However, most medicines which successfully treat angina either improve the blood flow to the heart muscle or reduce the speed of the beating heart.  Either effect may reduce the likelihood of long-term damage to the heart.

Why have I been prescribed Adalat LA 30 by my doctor?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Adalat LA 30 has been prescribed by your doctor to treat your high blood pressure or to reduce the frequency of your anginal attacks.  In high blood pressure, nifedipine works by widening the blood vessels.  This creates less resistance to the blood flow, and results in lower blood pressure, which in turn reduces the strain on your heart.  A good comparison is to imagine the difference in pressure you feel when you blow hard through a straw compared with something larger like the cardboard tube in a kitchen roll.  You will feel less pressure with the cardboard tube because the hole is larger.  It creates less resistance in the same way as does a widened blood vessel .
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
In angina, nifedipine works by opening up the arteries supplying the heart muscle and this allows more blood and oxygen to reach the muscle, decreasing the chances of angina occurring when extra strain is placed upon the heart.

<HEAD weight="bold" >
When should I NOT take Adalat LA 30?

<BLOCK>

What special precautions should I take?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>

<EMPH weight="bold">
IMPORTANT: Adalat LA tablets must be swallowed whole.  They will not work properly if they are bitten, chewed or broken up.  If you have difficulty in swallowing tablets, consult your doctor as he/she may wish to change your medicine.
</EMPH>

</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
You may see what appears to be the complete tablet in the toilet or associated with your stools.  This is normal as the outer shell of the tablet is not digested by the body.  It does not mean that your tablets are not working.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you experience chest pains within 4 hours of taking your FIRST dose of Adalat LA, contact your doctor BEFORE YOU TAKE THE NEXT DOSE.  He/she may wish to change your treatment.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Remind your doctor if you suffer from low blood pressure and he/she prescribes Adalat LA for your angina.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you notice increased breathlessness whilst taking Adalat LA, you should contact your doctor.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you are a diabetic, the treatment for your diabetes may need to be adjusted.  If you have any questions about this, ask your doctor.  Patients who are receiving kidney dialysis and have a very high blood pressure and low blood volume might experience a sudden drop in their blood pressure when they take Adalat LA.  If you are on kidney dialysis please consult your doctor before taking this medicine.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Adalat LA may interfere with the results of certain urine tests.  If you have given a urine sample, inform the person responsible that you are taking this medicine.
