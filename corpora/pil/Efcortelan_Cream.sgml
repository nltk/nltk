YOU SHOULD NOT use on large areas of the body for a long time (such as nearly every day for many weeks or months). Although Efcortelan Cream is generally regarded as safe even when used like this for many months it may be possible to produce side effects if

overused
</EMPH>
. Such overuse may thin the skin so that it damages easily and some of the active ingredient may pass through the skin and affect other parts of the body, especially in infants and children.
