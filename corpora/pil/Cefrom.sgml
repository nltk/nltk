ARE YOU TAKING ANY OTHER MEDICINES ?

<BLOCK>
Cefrom may interfere with other medicines that you may be taking; such as loop diuretics (used to increase the flow of urine) and aminoglycoside antibiotics (used to treat infections).
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
In some cases your doctor will arrange further monitoring for you, but this is routine and nothing to worry about.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
It is important that you tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist about ALL the medicines that you are taking including those bought without a prescription.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>

<EMPH weight="bold">
HOW SHOULD YOU TAKE YOUR MEDICINE ?
</EMPH>

</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Your medicine will always be given to you by a doctor or nurse. This is because it needs to be given either as an injection or by a drip.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Your doctor will have prescribed the dose of the medicine which is correct for you, depending on the type of infection and any other illnesses you may have. If you ask the person giving you the medicine they will tell you how much and how often you have been prescribed it by your doctor.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
WHAT IF YOU TAKE TOO MUCH  ?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
It is most unlikely that you will be given too much medicine by the nurse or doctor. Your doctor and nurse will be monitoring your progress, and checking the medicine that you are given. Always ask if you are not sure why you are getting a dose of medicine.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>
<DIV type=2>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
WHAT IF YOU MISS A DOSE ?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Your doctor or nurse have instructions when to give you your medicine. It is most unlikely that you will not be given the medicine as it has been prescribed. If you think that you may have missed a dose then talk to your nurse or doctor. It is important that the course of treatment your doctor has prescribed is taken. You may start to feel better but it is important not to stop taking this medicine, until the doctor advises, otherwise your condition may get worse again.

<HEAD weight="bold" >
WHAT ABOUT SIDE EFFECTS ?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
You may develop a skin rash or itchy skin, a fever, pain in your kidney region, tummy upsets, slight sickness or diarrhoea. If the diarrhoea gets very bad then no more Cefrom should be given to you and other medicines will be given to you to stop the diarrhoea.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If Cefrom is given as an injection some people find it slightly painful where the injection has been given and the skin may feel tingly or itchy.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Some people find that their sense of taste may be affected for a short time after taking Cefrom.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
People may sometimes develop severe allergic reactions, such as breathing difficulties which will require treatment immediately. If you experience this you should call a doctor or nurse urgently.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Cefrom may sometimes affect your blood, although this is very unusual. It may cause you to feel tired or generally unwell. If you take the medicine for more than 10 days, your doctor may ask you to take a blood test, but this is just routine and nothing to worry about.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you think you are reacting badly in any of these or any other ways to your medicine, talk to your nurse or doctor straight away.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>

<EMPH weight="bold">
