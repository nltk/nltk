What you should know before taking Androcur tablets
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
You will notice a reduction in your sexual desire while you are taking this medicine.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
When you have been taking Androcur for some months, you will probably become unable to make anyone pregnant, but note that this does not happen at once, and you should not rely on Androcur for contraception at any time. While the overall number of sperms that you produce will be reduced, more of your sperms than usual will be abnormal in shape. Some people think these abnormal sperms might possibly produce abnormal babies. Your doctor will be able to advise you further it you are thinking of having children.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Androcur does not work well in men who regularly drink a lot of alcohol.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Cyproterone acetate can increase the sugar in your blood, and if you are diabetic your doctor will check this regularly.

Disturbances of liver function, some of them severe, have been reported with high-dosed cyproterone acetate treatment. Your doctor may arrange for you to have regular liver tests during treatment.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
As with other sex steroids, benign and malignant liver changes have been reported in isolated cases. In very rare cases, liver tumours may lead to life-threatening bleeding in the abdomen. Tell your doctor it you have any new &quot;stomach&quot; discomfort or pain that does not soon clear up.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Effects on the blood (anaemia) and adrenal glands have also been reported rarely during long -term treatment with cyproterone acetate. Your doctor may arrange for you to have regular blood tests during treatment.
</BLOCK>
