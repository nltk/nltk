</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Twice a day, after washing your hands, gently rub the correct amount of ointment into the skin until it has all disappeared.

Do not worry if you find you need a little more or a little less than this - it is only a rough guide.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Wash your hands before using the ointment. Gently rub the correct amount into the skin until it has all disappeared.

Unless

 used for treating the hands wash them again

after

 using the ointment. Anyone who helps to rub in the ointment should also do the same or wear disposable plastic gloves.

For a child
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
It should not be used in children under one year of age.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The smaller the child the less you use.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
A child of 4 years needs about a third of the adult amount.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
A course of treatment for a child should not normally last more than five days unless your doctor has told you to use it for longer.

<BLOCK>
Most people find using this ointment causes no problems when used in the right amount for the correct length of time (See above).
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Occasionally some people experience a little burning or irritation when the ointment is applied.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
IF you find your condition gets worse during treatment you may be allergic to the ointment or have a skin infection.

<HEAD weight="bold" >
STOP USING THE OINTMENT AND TELL YOUR DOCTOR AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Using more than the correct amount may:
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
-thin the skin so it damages easily -allow the active ingredient to pass through the skin and affect other pans of the body especially in infants and children, and during pregnancy.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
However, this is very unlikely unless treating very large areas and using large quantities of Cutivate.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If your doctor has prescribed the ointment for psoriasis you should let your doctor review your progress at regular intervals, as such treatment needs careful supervision.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Repeated courses of topical steroids over a long time may sometimes cause changes in hair growth and skin colour.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you feel unwell or have any unusual discomfort you do not understand, tell your doctor as soon as possible.
