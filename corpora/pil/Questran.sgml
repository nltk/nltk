Q.What is this medicine for?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
A.Questran and Questran Light are used to lower your body's level of cholesterol (a type of fat) and should always be used together with a low fat diet.  Questran and Questran Light work exclusively in the digestive system to absorb the cholesterol-containing bile acids which then pass out through the body in the faeces.  You probably feel quite well and would not notice you have high cholesterol, but too much of it in the blood stream is one of the important causes of heart attacks.  Your doctor has prescribed Questran or Questran Light to try to reduce the chances of this happening.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Questran and Questran Light may also be used to help stop some types of diarrhoea or itching.  If you are taking the medicine for these conditions, then you may not need to adhere to a low fat diet.

Q.Can I take any other medicines?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
A.Questran and Questran Light may change the effect of other medicines by stopping them from working so well.  Questran preparations stay in the digestive system and can stop other medicines from getting into the bloodstream by acting like a sponge and stopping them from being absorbed by the body.  To avoid this, the time at which you take your medicines is very important.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Any other medicines you are taking should be taken at a different time from your dose of Questran or Questran Light.  For example, if you take a dose of Questran or Questran Light at 9.00am, any other medicines should be taken at least one hour before the Questran or Questran Light dose (this means before 8.00am), or 4-6 hours after your dose of Questran or Questran Light (this would be 1.00 - 3.00pm).
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you are unsure, ask your doctor or pharmacist.  Always tell your doctor about any other medicines you are using, even those you have bought over the counter in a pharmacy or elsewhere, e.g. supermarket.

Q.Is it all right to drink alcohol?

Q.How should I take Questran or Questran Light sachets?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
A.The label will tell you how many sachets and how often your doctor wants you to take this medicine.  To lower your cholesterol, the usual dose is 3-6 sachets each day.  Your dose may be taken as a single daily dose or in divided doses up to 4 times a day.  To relieve itching, the usual dose is one or two sachets each day.  The dose in children depends on the child's weight which your doctor will work out.  The contents of one sachet should be sprinkled evenly on the surface of 150 ml (4-6 fluid oz) of water or fruit juice.  Allow to stand for one or two minutes. After the powder becomes wetted, stir or shake to make a uniform suspension.  Questran or Questran Light can be mixed with water, fruit juice, skimmed milk, thin soups or pulpy fruits with a high moisture content e.g. apple sauce.

Q.Are there any unwanted effects of Questran or Questran Light?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
A.Any medicine may cause some unwanted effects.  Taking Questran or Questran Light is much like changing your diet.  Some people may develop constipation or feel slightly bloated or suffer from a little wind during the first few days of treatment.  These normally reduce over time and frequently disappear if treatment is continued.  However, check with your doctor if these effects continue or are bothersome.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you are starting Questran or Questran Light for the first time, by increasing the dose slowly you will minimise these effects.  Usually patients start with one sachet daily for a week or so, then increase the dose by one sachet every week until they are taking the number of sachets the doctor has prescribed.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Large doses of Questran may cause diarrhoea.  After using Questran or similar products for a long time, a few patients have experienced unusual tiredness and rapid or deep breathing.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you notice any other unusual effects while taking Questran or Questran Light, check with your doctor or pharmacist.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Long-term treatment with high doses of Questran or Questran Light may reduce the body's absorption of fat-soluble vitamins from the diet (vitamins A, D and K).  In some patients, reduced absorption of vitamin K could increase the time it takes for the blood to clot.  If you are worried about this, please discuss it with your doctor who may suggest a vitamin supplement.

LOOKING AFTER YOUR MEDICINE
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
You will see an 'EXPIRY DATE' on the packaging of Questran or Questran Light.  Do not use after this date.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Keep all your medicines where children cannot reach them.  Keep Questran or Questran Light sachets at room temperature (i.e. below 30°C).  They should not get too hot or damp; so do not leave the sachets near a radiator, on a window sill, or in the bathroom.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If your doctor decides to stop the sachets, take the remainder back to a pharmacy.
