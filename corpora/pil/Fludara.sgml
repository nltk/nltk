What is chronic Iymphocytic leukaemia?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Fludara is used to treat chronic Iymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) This is a cancer of the type of white blood cells called lymphocytes Too many lymphocytes are produced and they either don't work properly or are too young (immature) to carry out the normal disease fighting functions of white blood cells If there are too many of these abnormal cells they push aside (displace) healthy blood cells in the bone marrow where most new blood cells are formed and in the blood stream and organs as well Without enough healthy blood cells, infections, anaemia, bruising, excessive bleeding (haemorrhaging) or even organ failure can result

How does Fludara works?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
In order for both normal and leukaemia cells to grow and produce more cells like themselves the cells' genetic material (DNA) must be copied and reproduced Fludara works by interfering with the production of new DNA. Therefore, when Fludara is taken up by the <CB n=1> leukaemia cells it stops the growth of new leukaemia cells

<BLOCK>
Fludara is a cytotoxic (anti-cancer) drug.
