How should Leustat be used?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>

<EMPH slant = "italic">
Adults and the elderly:
</EMPH>
 The normal dose is based on your body weight in kilograms and is usually 0.09 mg per kilogram per day. This dose is repeated daily for seven days without a break.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>

<EMPH slant = "italic">
Children:
</EMPH>
 Leustat injection is not recommended for children.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Leustat is normally diluted in 100-500 ml of a 0.9 percent solution of sodium chloride and then given by infusion into a vein (intravenous infusion). Each dose is normally given by continuous infusion over a 24-hour period.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Your doctor will order regular blood tests before <CB n=2> and during your treatment, to check that your liver and kidneys are working properly and to follow the effects of the treatment with Leustat.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Your doctor may decide to delay or discontinue therapy if side effects develop.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>
<DIV type=1>

<HEAD weight="bold" >

</BLOCK>


</DIV>
<DIV type=1>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
What side effects can Leustat cause?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
As with any other medicine, Leustat may cause unwanted side effects:
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Leustat can reduce the ability of your bone marrow to produce blood cells.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If the production of red blood cells is affected, this can lead to anaemia, which may be very severe.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If the production of white blood cells is affected, this can lead to neutropenia which reduces your body's defences so that you may get an infection. This may require the use of antibiotics.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Leustat can also affect the production of platelets: these are small blood cells important for the proper clotting of blood. A fall in the number of platelets (thrombocytopenia) can lead to easier bruising and bleeding under the skin.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Leustat may affect the kidneys, leading to a decrease in their ability to get rid of waste products from the blood and a decrease in urine production.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Leustat can cause serious nerve damage, including partial or complete paralysis which may not be reversible, but usually only if given in doses higher than those normally recommended.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>

Additional information
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
When abnormal white blood cells are destroyed in large numbers they can release certain substances into the blood. This may cause the blood levels of these substances to rise, leading to kidney or heart problems. You doctor will be able to detect this from the results of regular blood tests he/she is using to monitor your treatment.
