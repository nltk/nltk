THE PULMICORT SPACER INHALER

<BLOCK>
The Spacer inhaler makes it easier to inhale Pulmicort because the Spacer chamber slows down the speed of the aerosol mist, so that it can be more easily breathed into the lungs, where it acts.  To make it easier to carry, the Spacer Inhaler con be folded up, like a telescope.  To assemble the Spacer inhaler correctly and stop it folding up in use, you must follow the instructions carefully.
</BLOCK>

<CB n=2>

<BLOCK>
Note: When the Spacer Inhaler is correctly used you will not feel the cold spray hitting the mouth or throat.  This means that more of the spray is reaching your lungs.
