WHAT CAN MINOCIN MR BE USED TO TREAT?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Minocycline, the active ingredient in MINOCIN MR, is a tetracycline antibiotic used in the treatment of acne. Acne results from clogging of skin pores. In its mildest form this causes whiteheads and blackheads. If these become infected, spots appear. MINOCIN MR reduces the infection and allows the spots to heal.
