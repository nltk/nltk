CAN YOU USE 'TIMOPTOL'-LA OPHTHALMIC GEL-FORMING SOLUTION WITH OTHER MEDICINES?
</EMPH>

</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
'Timoptol'-LA Ophthalmic Gel-Forming Solution does not usually interfere with other medicines that you may be taking. These eye drops are often used with other eye drops to treat eye conditions. There are some medicines - such as those used to treat high blood pressure - which interfere with 'Timoptol'-LA Ophthalmic Gel-Forming Solution. Your doctor knows about these. It is important, however, that you tell your doctor about all the medicines you are taking, including those bought without a prescription.

HOW SHOULD YOU USE THE EYE DROPS?
</EMPH>

</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
You should use the drops exactly as your doctor has advised. The dose will depend on your condition, how quickly you respond and whether you are taking any other treatment. Usually the dose is one drop of 0.25% solution once a day: Some people need a stronger dose. Your doctor will change your treatment as necessary. Do not use more or less than your doctor has prescribed. Do not stop the treatment without talking to your doctor first. You may not feel any different but the drops are helping to reduce the pressure in your eye(s) - you should use them until your doctor says you no longer need them.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If your doctor recommends that you use 'Timoptol'-LA Ophthalmic Gel-Forming Solution with another eye drop, the other medicine should be administered at least 10 minutes before ‘Timoptol'-LA Ophthalmic Gel-Forming Solution.
