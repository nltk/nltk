169.654875 171.637625 [silence]
171.637625 182.673250 yeah i can honestly say we do um we uh just recently put a security system in our house and so now uh in order to uh
182.673250 194.661500 to accommodate the motion detectors we have to keep her uh uh locked up in the the master bedroom during the day and then she's got the the bedroom and the bathroom to for free run during the day but
194.661500 203.309250 we've always got a got a nose and a tongue pressed up against the window uh when we come walking up to the front door she's definitely ready to get out and r[un]- run around
203.309250 207.068000 [silence]
207.068000 208.466875 really

235.849250 236.852875 [silence]
236.852875 238.567875 most definitely
238.567875 242.522125 [silence]
242.522125 249.741375 yeah yeah [laughter-the] yeah that's a that's a definite security involved in uh in a dog like that
249.741375 259.078500 [silence]
259.078500 260.535375 um-hum
260.535375 266.707000 [silence]
266.707000 268.758625 wow that's uh
268.758625 271.737750 [silence]
271.737750 274.078250 yeah that's interesting
274.078250 276.739250 [silence]
276.739250 284.391875 yeah i kn[ow]- i know our dog has had uh had some different reactions she's never really been around children and uh
284.391875 297.514500 if if the child is is pretty straight forward um she's fine i[f]- if a child is a little intimidated she'll jump around and and yip and bark quite a bit and if the child gets scared
297.514500 306.281125 uh she's still trying to play but she doesn't completely understand what's going on and we've had a little confusion w[ith]- with uh with younger kids
306.281125 315.358375 but uh you know that's it's a matter of exposure really um we uh took her home to uh my family's place in South Dakota
315.358375 320.506250 and she was the one that was intimidated then there was about seven kids ranging from about
320.506250 334.885875 three years to ten years running around the house all at one time you know come to visit grandpa and grandma and the dog [laughter-kind] kind of felt out of place then because_1 she was she was being fed and everything else from all directions she really didn't know how to handle herself so
334.885875 336.010250 [silence]
336.010250 350.727125 she really did she just uh she she was alm[ost]- she was just inundated with with all the attention uh she she kind of she kind of sat and and soaked it all in for a little while and then she'd go get back in and try to play and and whatnot but uh
350.727125 357.839625 it was it was just su[ch]- such a new experience for her she's only been around one and and sometimes two people at the most so uh
357.839625 358.959375 [silence]
358.959375 360.825250 uh pardon
360.825250 363.192125 oh it's uh Mitzi

368.953625 370.873375 [silence]
370.873375 372.586875 [laughter-i] see
372.586875 380.658875 [silence]
380.658875 382.756625 yeah yeah
382.756625 389.998875 yeah i had uh i had a similar uh experience i i grew up on a farm so i always had uh outdoor pets
389.998875 398.465375 and uh the dog i had when i moved to Dallas about five years ago was a uh Springer Spaniel black Lab cross
398.465375 407.589125 and he was a real a real lovable type but uh definitely not an apartment type animal so he uh he had to stay home
407.589125 419.327750 yeah yeah it really was it he uh apparently had a tough time with it for a little while then he he got he came to accept the fact that mom and dad were his company from then on but uh
419.327750 420.860875 [silence]
420.860875 422.315000 yeah
422.315000 424.061375 [silence]
424.061375 425.668750 okay
425.668750 427.570000 most definitely
427.570000 429.804000 well that's great
429.804000 431.913625 that sounds real good
431.913625 434.049125 you too bye
434.049125 436.778750 [noise]

0.000000 1.477250 [noise]
1.477250 10.268875 yes um i was wondering whether you were in favor of statehood independence or the status quo for Puerto Rico
10.268875 54.593375 [silence]
54.593375 57.683250 well i'm i guess
57.683250 64.969875 i don't have su[ch]- such close experience with with um an area becoming a state as you do
64.969875 78.004125 um my concern is the economy because as i understand it Puerto Rico has a very low st[andard]- uh standard of living or at least um annual average income
78.004125 89.611750 um part of this i suppose is justified in i[n]- in that the climate they don't need perhaps the heating and the housing that some of th[e]- the more northern territories need
89.611750 94.837000 however in that case i guess i would favor status quo
94.837000 100.660500 i have been to Puerto Rico and and found it very very interesting i did Peace Corps training there
100.660500 113.374125 and so um you know i saw it also as a young student and and it was very foreign in a certain sense although i had grown up in California and so the Spanish was no problem
113.374125 115.697625 um it was
115.697625 124.477625 it was you know very lovely and and the people seemed very friendly and and nice i have actually i work with uh
124.477625 130.733625 a girl from Puerto Rico and i guess i have never thought to ask her which she favors
130.733625 132.221750 uh
132.221750 142.573500 [silence]
142.573500 146.323500 well probably more on in terms of the US
146.323500 147.909375 um
147.909375 152.053500 you know i i'm not quite sure how the US copes
152.053500 156.442750 with this sort of thing i've live [abrode/abroad] abroad most of my life so
156.442750 163.913250 i guess i i've been very cut off uh i lived actually in Lebanon so i was very cut off from the
163.913250 166.375125 the press as i w[as]- you know
166.375125 172.681875 and uh bec[oming]- was becoming an adult so i don't know how the US would cope with it a
172.681875 177.051000 new state that is so very very poor
177.051000 183.882625 um i guess you know we'd have a lot of aid if if you consider the inner cities of
183.882625 194.221875 like New York and and how much aid it needs i suppose the whole country or the whole um new state would require such aid
194.221875 203.989750 [silence]
203.989750 205.842750 i think so
205.842750 222.480750 [silence]
222.480750 224.120250 um-hum
224.120250 299.540250 [silence]
299.540250 304.796500 um-hum yeah th[ose]- those are good points um which obviously [laughter-i'd] never thought about
304.796500 306.170625 um
306.170625 309.995875 i don't know wh[at]- uh i suppose
309.995875 313.441250 they also not being a state are
313.441250 317.186500 probably freer to determine their own
317.186500 321.609750 um ways of life than they would if if
321.609750 328.737625 i- i'm trying to think exactly what is imposed if they would become a state versus a territory
328.737625 331.514750 perhaps compulsory education
331.514750 333.151250 [silence]
333.151250 334.582625 um
334.582625 337.103125 and taxes [laughter]
337.103125 381.357500 [silence]
381.357500 390.065375 um-hum w[ell]- well actually i thin[k]- one one thing that i remember hearing in the news the past couple weeks that might be significant is that
390.065375 396.939375 they've recently voted that Spanish is the official language which i always assumed it was anyway
396.939375 400.320625 so if they've just taken such action
400.320625 407.986750 it would seem to indicate to me either they're doing it because they're afraid they might become a state and want
407.986750 411.423750 to declare this before they become a state
411.423750 419.981750 or maybe because they don't want to become a state for fear of losing the Spanish or Hispanic heritage
419.981750 427.745250 [silence]
427.745250 431.775625 i i believe i would probably tend towards that
431.775625 444.943750 [silence]
444.943750 446.791250 well that's interesting
446.791250 450.045250 [silence]
450.045250 457.522875 right what about if if um they demanded to have Spanish as the official language
457.522875 460.250000 as a condition for statehood
460.250000 488.920250 [silence]
488.920250 490.269250 um-hum

528.795375 529.956625 [silence]
529.956625 531.975500 that's interesting because
531.975500 536.690000 although i tend to be bilingual Spanish based on experience
536.690000 538.481250 uh
538.481250 543.372375 i was in bilingual education in California and
543.372375 546.611125 i didn't have any problem with my students but i noticed my
546.611125 550.520250 my brother wh[o]- who was uh quite a bit younger
550.520250 555.131000 was learning Spanish in elementary school and he can't speak a word
555.131000 558.961625 and so obviously it didn't work in California
558.961625 560.943750 [silence]
560.943750 562.309125 right
562.309125 566.688375 [silence]
566.688375 567.992750 right
567.992750 573.317750 [silence]
573.317750 575.314250 oh i see
575.314250 580.177875 [silence]
580.177875 581.881750 um-hum um-hum
581.881750 585.802625 [silence]
585.802625 588.337250 o[kay]- okay well thank you very much
588.337250 589.671000 bye-bye

1.143750 10.886000 [silence]
10.886000 12.384500 i was a
12.384500 22.629125 resident although very young of the s[tate]- of what is now the state of Alaska in nineteen fifty nine when Alaska stopped being a territory became a state
22.629125 26.123875 uh so i guess i have a left over
26.123875 32.230250 positive feeling about the question even though i don't know [laughter-very] much about Puerto Rico
32.230250 42.356375 um i know that all the things that happened relative to that territory in Alaska have been very positive uh and i k[ind]- have a suspicion that that i
42.356375 53.049875 believe that a that statehood is a good idea whenever you have a territory the size of Puerto Rico one ought either to make it a full-fledged state or or let it go one or the other
53.049875 55.378750 what is your situation
55.378750 99.809250 [silence]
99.809250 101.683250 oh that's very interesting
101.683250 131.120625 [silence]
131.120625 143.418000 your concern on the economies was one in terms of if it became a state would that put even more pressures on on Puerto Rico or pressures on the US in terms of aid or
143.418000 168.926500 [silence]
168.926500 170.273625 um-hum
170.273625 176.037500 [silence]
176.037500 177.369875 um-hum
177.369875 193.556750 [silence]
193.556750 195.053750 i guess
195.053750 196.286000 um
196.286000 205.010750 we're assuming that that Puerto Rico would be per capita significantly more poor perhaps than than say Mississippi or
205.010750 206.524625 okay
206.524625 211.254625 that's something th[at]- that i guess i have not much of an image of other than
211.254625 219.607250 than Puerto Rico as a tropical island and consequently large numbers of barefoot natives or something uh not in a
219.607250 228.875625 pejorative sense but in a in a carefree sense i guess although i'm aware of the political problems and unrest and and also difficulties they have
228.875625 230.428250 um
230.428250 237.519000 i don't know whether state woul[d]- statehood would improve their economy i don't i don't know that the ve[ry]- the act of being a state
237.519000 248.888875 would would have any impact on on them uh i guess they would have the ability to do some taxing that they don't have now but of course if their economy is weak that there is not much of a base on which to tax
248.888875 251.085000 i don't know if they suffer
251.085000 252.903375 in a sense of
252.903375 263.199500 income loss as being since they aren't a state whether there are monies that escape them so to speak because they aren't able to tax like a typical state would be
263.199500 265.197000 how do you feel though about
265.197000 278.597125 well i guess it's to their advantage to be a territory but uh i wonder how hav[ing]- having been in a territory but only as a young student and my parents were in the military at the time so they didn't have ready negative feelings about being in the s[tates]- in the
278.597125 281.908625 Alaska at the time since th[ey]- they voted absentee
281.908625 286.975250 i i would imagine that it must be a little bit of a se[cond]- feeling of second class citizenry
286.975250 294.686750 uh to be in a territory that large and not being able to vote the District of Columbia people for instance are quite frustrated i think at times
294.686750 298.010375 in their not having a Senate representative
298.010375 328.132000 [silence]
328.132000 329.614500 um-hum
329.614500 331.459875 [silence]
331.459875 333.864000 uh i see what you mean so that
333.864000 336.068375 [silence]
336.068375 345.041625 yeah taxes would undoubtedly be occurring uh there i don't know i don't even understand exactly how taxes are handled in a territorial situation
345.041625 346.536875 um
346.536875 360.976375 frequently the laws in a territory are are in some ways as stringent as they are in other states i uh and i'm thinking in terms of education but then again each state sets its own and i don't know how a territorial governor takes care of something like Puerto Rico
360.976375 362.234375 [silence]
362.234375 370.079125 um it's interesting because i haven't thought of them in terms of the problems relative to to uh economy
370.079125 371.435375 uh
371.435375 374.744875 i had thought of it more in terms of political uh
374.744875 382.373375 realization and i guess i had automatically made the assumption that gee anyone would rather be a state of the US than an independent country
382.373375 383.606500 so
383.606500 396.243250 [silence]
396.243250 397.735875 um-hum

419.201750 420.390000 uh-huh
420.390000 421.715000 that's interesting
421.715000 423.671750 [silence]
423.671750 428.129750 well it sounds as though you are in favor of uh status quo
428.129750 431.498375 [silence]
431.498375 444.468750 and i think uh having listened to you relative to the economy thing i think if i were being forced to make a decision i would plead ignorance and wait to do more research before picking one of these so i'm ult[imately]- i guess i'm ultimately in favor of status quo also
444.468750 445.471000 [silence]
445.471000 447.317375 at this point
447.317375 449.814875 leaning towards uh statehood
449.814875 461.365625 [silence]
461.365625 476.130750 i think i would be troubled i suspect i believe that any of our states and i i constitutionally i don't think there are any prescriptions abou[t]- against that decision even if uh Louisiana chose to go with Creole or something
476.130750 477.326250 um
477.326250 491.713750 i don't think there is any prohibitions i would be bothered by that i'm i'm bothered by any tendency to resist what i think was one of America's strengths and that's the the the melting pot uh i i-
491.713750 505.570750 am particularly fond of a number of ethnic cuisines but i'm troubled by too close a clinging to to the past and i'm also realizing that that a common language i think is the ultimate bond of a country
505.570750 514.165125 and Canada i guess comes to my mind as they're going through the throes up there relative to French Quebec and whatever uh that i i think that would be
514.165125 518.860000 a a negative step to make and i think that that they would need to reassess that
518.860000 519.976250 um
519.976250 527.750000 i'm troubled even in by bilingualism uh in so far that it intr[udes]- it gets in the way of of of the melting pot aspect
527.750000 554.542000 [silence]
554.542000 555.777250 hum
555.777250 557.929375 [silence]
557.929375 559.032500 yeah
559.032500 567.500625 but i'm rather in favor of people being bilingual and i'd be quite happy to see a national law in which every student was required to learn English and a second language
567.500625 574.271500 but i'm i'm disturbed by a country that attempts to be functionally bilingual at the official level
574.271500 575.812500 [silence]
575.812500 577.019625 um
577.019625 581.042125 i'm i'm concerned about whether or not that causes fractiousness i guess
581.042125 583.071375 [silence]
583.071375 587.032625 well i think we have gone to time and i appreciate your having called

16.024500 17.172000 yes
17.172000 22.528000 [silence]
22.528000 29.070375 yes it's certain crimes uh capital crimes murder of course uh rape this sort of thing
29.070375 30.244250 [silence]
30.244250 36.075500 and it seems to be a disproportionate number of blacks you know that get into the system
36.075500 56.501500 [silence]
56.501500 58.571125 um-hum yes th[at]-
58.571125 67.678000 that happens on occasion it sure does maybe it just depends on you know how closely the crime you know has affected you personally you know i don't know or a person personally
67.678000 74.576875 i think i would be [laughter] you know i guess really if i had to say yes or no i guess i would say you know that
74.576875 84.349750 i am in certain cases in favor of the death penalty i don't know that it's a big deterrent really i don't know that it is i don't know how we'd ever find out you know really whether it is or not
84.349750 86.680000 [silence]
86.680000 93.758250 oh yeah oh absolutely yeah it goes on for years and years and costs hundreds of thousands of dollars taxpayer money

111.244250 112.404125 [silence]
112.404125 116.002375 yeah it is it's it's a tough tough question it really is
116.002375 126.506250 i suspect i would be uh you know a lot more favor of it if you know one of my children were you know brutally killed or something like that like i say i think it depends on how personally affected you know you might be by it
126.506250 129.627750 [silence]
129.627750 131.482125 oh absolutely
131.482125 132.906500 th[at's]-
132.906500 134.318875 that's right
134.318875 139.544625 [silence]
139.544625 142.315000 [noise] not with me personally it is with a lot of other people

156.993000 159.684750 that's a it's a tough tough question it really is
159.684750 162.891500 [silence]
162.891500 166.164625 yes i think most states do have capital punishment yes
166.164625 167.254125 [silence]
167.254125 170.748250 but i think the US is one of the few countries that still do
170.748250 171.821000 [silence]
171.821000 180.700000 yes they're only i was reading something about it the other day i think there was only like six or eight countries in the world that have capital punishment still
180.700000 187.437625 a lot of them_1 had to have el[ected]- elected not to do so now i don't know what they do in place of it you know maybe it's
187.437625 190.582000 life imprisonment or you know something i don't i don't know how they handle it bu[t]-
190.582000 194.471375 i was surprised to learn that so few countries have capital punishment
194.471375 200.548875 [silence]
200.548875 201.971250 oh yeah
201.971250 205.344000 [silence]
205.344000 209.287750 yes a lot of them_1 do get their sentences commuted to something else
209.287750 213.615000 [silence]
213.615000 214.660875 yes

220.073875 221.224125 [silence]
221.224125 224.150750 [noise] right the first appeal is automatic so
224.150750 227.455625 that delays it for a few years just right off the bat
227.455625 228.588250 [silence]
228.588250 231.959875 there's there's a lot of you know last minute uh [noise]
231.959875 236.323500 things that happen cause a person not to have to go through the whole thing
236.323500 239.511875 [silence]
239.511875 248.617250 yes uh-huh that's that's fairly recent i don't know how recent but fairly recent in the state of Texas before that it was uh death by electrocution
248.617250 249.744500 [silence]
249.744500 251.756750 yes it certainly does
251.756750 254.228875 [silence]
254.228875 260.465750 yes it would almost have to be i suppose if you if you had to chose i guess i [laughter-would] i am sure i would take the lethal injection
260.465750 262.444375 [silence]
262.444375 264.569000 yes absolutely
264.569000 269.367250 it's a it's a tough question it really is i guess if i had to say
269.367250 276.395750 you know yes or no i would say you know yes i- i would have to lean toward capital punishment you know for certain crimes
276.395750 283.711500 [silence]
283.711500 288.039250 no i don't think it's a monetary thing i think we hope that it will be you know
288.039250 293.446625 some sort of [determent/deterrent] deterrent or you know an eye for an eye type thing or something like that
293.446625 297.453250 some of the crimes are just so brutal and so you know useless
297.453250 298.579500 [silence]
298.579500 302.133625 this may seem to be the best way out i don't know
302.133625 304.009875 easiest way out maybe
304.009875 306.200750 no i don't think it's a monetary thing
306.200750 310.943375 [silence]
310.943375 314.737625 yes especially the murder rate its just gone crazy
314.737625 315.741750 [silence]

317.937000 320.719375 [silence]
320.719375 324.378500 yes i wish i had the answer for that everybody does
324.378500 328.054250 [silence]
328.054250 331.784375 yes it's nothing to be proud of certainly not

334.897375 336.099625 yes
336.099625 338.961375 so have we been very very fortunate

45.617750 46.245000 [noise]
46.245000 52.003250 are going to be killed [noise] um there's people that come to the prisons and [noise]

93.382750 98.248625 yeah it's really sad i don't know i just think um
98.248625 104.756875 somehow i hoped that as a people we could be better than than um expecting
104.756875 110.867375 the feeling that it right with someone is calling for someone else to be killed you know
110.867375 113.114125 [noise] is really kind of bad and
113.114125 115.526625 [silence]
115.526625 116.763625 hum
116.763625 126.330000 [silence]
126.330000 133.840250 that's true and there really are criminals that are hard-core and repeat and ne[ver]- never have any chance for
133.840250 140.535250 [vocalized-noise] oh i don't know is it do you feel at all like it's a religious issue
140.535250 141.899250 [noise]

145.541750 157.597250 i don't know sometimes i feel i mean i do go to church and things i don't know how i would feel about it but like you say if it hit you personally closer at home you would feel feel differently
157.597250 159.257625 [silence]
159.257625 162.827125 do you think most states have that or
162.827125 165.396125 [silence]
165.396125 167.641375 um-hum hum
167.641375 170.783500 [silence]

181.648250 193.896000 [silence]
193.896000 206.384875 have that well and it doesn't seem like very many people uh are really i mean there's a lot of people that are on death row but there's not very many people that actually um do get killed
206.384875 207.508875 [silence]
207.508875 209.027000 um-hum
209.027000 212.483125 so seems like a lot of people live there and 
212.483125 219.644875 through appeals because i know they do frequently i mean they cover cover it pretty heavily on television and the newspaper
219.644875 222.365375 if it finally gets to that point
222.365375 227.638250 [silence]
227.638250 228.861625 yeah
228.861625 234.569500 [silence]

240.906125 247.857750 [silence]
247.857750 250.234375 um-hum wh[ich]- which seems so awful
250.234375 251.631875 [silence]
251.631875 255.427250 so it's a little bit more humane i guess it is
255.427250 259.370000 [silence]
259.370000 260.601750 [laughter]
260.601750 263.162750 yes the other one just seems so terrible
263.162750 264.188750 [silence]
264.188750 265.241250 hum
265.241250 276.126125 [silence]
276.126125 284.973875 well do you think that we do it because we want it to deter crime or it's not because we don't want to pay for inmates to stay in prison
284.973875 286.454250 um-hum
286.454250 292.714500 [silence]
292.714500 294.171250 hum

301.811750 303.168000 yes
303.168000 305.713000 [silence]
305.713000 307.154125 hum
307.154125 311.907000 well um and i notice that the crime rate was up in the Dallas area
311.907000 312.883125 [noise] it's
312.883125 314.489875 [silence]
314.489875 317.734625 and it's kind of been scary to think about it and
317.734625 321.873875 you're hoping there is something that will cut down on that
321.873875 323.827750 [silence]
323.827750 326.841875 you hate to have the dubious honor of being
326.841875 328.955125 you know so high in the
328.955125 330.660000 in statistics
330.660000 331.899000 [silence]
331.899000 335.621125 but i you know we have been really fortunate our family hasn't had [noise]
335.621125 336.927500 any crime
336.927500 339.028250 [silence]
339.028250 341.203000 and so we don't
341.203000 345.615750 it's harder to think about the poor people that have suffered that way
345.615750 348.533375 and how they would expect how they would
348.533375 357.250750 hope i mean you you hear of people who have um committed crimes and then they get out of jail and they go and they do the same thing again and you wonder why they can't just stop it
357.250750 358.265375 [silence]
358.265375 360.097750 so maybe you would
360.097750 364.413000 but still i would hate to be on the jury that sentenced someone
364.413000 367.988875 [silence]
367.988875 374.274875 no [laughter] i know when um we just we moved here um i from the
374.274875 378.156250 i got a summons jury summons just
378.156250 387.807000 like [laughter-constantly] it seemed like but fortunately i had small children and i didn't have to go and it's not that i mean i think everyone should have to serve on the jury it's just that
387.807000 392.196375 i didn't i hate having to be in charge of someone else's life
392.196375 394.186250 [silence]
394.186250 401.282000 and i would hate to have to hear any kind of case involving a violent crime or anything
401.282000 403.052500 that would be really awful
403.052500 404.518250 [silence]
404.518250 411.078750 well anyway i sure have enjoyed uh [laughter] talking about this although it has been difficult but uh
411.078750 414.652500 i'd hate to decide it but i guess um
414.652500 419.587375 guess it's important that we decide as a people what what we're going to do
419.587375 421.955750 anyway well you have a good day
421.955750 424.193750 thank you bye-bye

79.434250 89.042500 well i work for DISD and i don't know what you're talking about when you say uh health insurance but Dallas doesn't pay it pays most of mine 
89.042500 100.641625 you know now after you work i think five years they begin to pay most of it but then for the the family you know m[y]- i put my kids on my policy it's like two hundred dollars
100.641625 111.110125 and it's gone up quite a bit and they predict you know of course it's going to keep going up i wish they could go on and pay for all of our coverage at some point
111.110125 117.501875 and benefits you know i'd like to see child care paid for or or on-site ch[ild]- child care sometime
117.501875 118.882875 [silence]
118.882875 127.559125 i think that would be an excellent idea and it would make women go to work sometimes if they knew their kids were being taken care of they could go visit them during the day
127.559125 129.254250 what
129.254250 140.002000 [silence]
140.002000 146.471125 well we can shelter also monies that we're going to pay in for child care too you know go on and pay a lump sum
146.471125 152.503375 and as long as you pay that amount you're okay but if you paid in more than you actually used
152.503375 156.642625 and the same thing for insurance what you predict you're going to be paying for insurance
156.642625 161.521500 as long as you pay actually pay out that amount of money you're okay but if you pay out
161.521500 164.278000 less then you lose that money
164.278000 168.216500 i don't like that part but you don't have to do that option if you don't want to
168.216500 171.344750 [silence]
171.344750 175.035500 and then we got that cafeteria plan do you have that

183.236375 187.565875 it takes it out of your salary before taxes
187.565875 188.664875 [silence]
188.664875 189.579875 okay

57.807375 60.421625 around inside the organization
60.421625 67.360875 without having you know when they cut off a system and they don't just can everybody that's working on it like some companies i know of
67.360875 72.014000 you know they give you an opportunity to transfer into uh an on going project
72.014000 75.985000 [silence]
75.985000 77.075250 yep
77.075250 78.405500 what
78.405500 100.096875 [silence]
100.096875 101.709000 um-hum
101.709000 120.394625 [silence]
120.394625 121.806625 well
121.806625 128.680625 [silence]
128.680625 133.511750 yeah that's uh that's something i hadn't really thought about since we don't have children
133.511750 137.667250 but i can see how it would be a real benefit
137.667250 139.540250 those that do
139.540250 163.942000 [silence]
163.942000 164.979125 hum
164.979125 168.801750 [silence]
168.801750 171.616500 well that can i can see where that might be important
171.616500 174.846625 [silence]
174.846625 176.171500 no
176.171500 178.556000 i i don't know what you're talking about there
178.556000 186.483625 [silence]
186.483625 190.643125 oh okay yeah yeah we got that pre tax insurance
190.643125 191.799375 yeah
191.799375 192.411125 [vocalized-noise]
192.411125 193.597250 [silence]
193.597250 195.284250 hum
195.284250 199.094250 oh it's probably what the first guy who did it called it
199.094250 202.955000 yeah he was probably in the cafeteria when he thought of [laughter-it]
202.955000 205.763125 [laughter]
205.763125 209.119625 [silence]
209.119625 211.021875 i'll tell you what we could do
211.021875 214.550500 we could prohibit people from being hired that are
214.550500 218.766125 historically going to cost the company money
218.766125 222.332375 you know do a little bit better research on who gets hired
222.332375 225.652125 because you know i[f]-
225.652125 230.052000 well no[t]- not only just health insurance i mean for the whole benefit of the company
230.052000 234.306500 see i look at it this way if the company folds i got to go find a job
234.306500 242.990125 okay now if we get somebody in a position to affect the way the company performs just about anybody in the company
242.990125 246.850875 and they're not doing their job or they're not capable of doing their job then we should find
246.850875 250.711625 a a place to put them_1 or b you know boot them_1 out
250.711625 255.709250 [silence]
255.709250 259.774750 well frankly i think school teachers ought to get about ten times what they're getting paid
259.774750 262.198125 [silence]
262.198125 263.623500 what
263.623500 265.939500 oh well
265.939500 267.552000 i'm i'm
267.552000 269.631375 [silence]
269.631375 270.914000 i know
270.914000 272.197500 [silence]
272.197500 280.192375 well there's two schools of thought on that you know i i'm looking at trying to get into a university job position as a professor
280.192375 284.014375 i got about eight years of education ahead of me before i can do that
284.014375 285.432125 but
285.432125 290.018625 once you get that job with the university then you've got ten years of probation
290.018625 292.374750 then you have tenure
292.374750 294.504250 and they can't fire you
294.504250 302.848250 well you know in a situation like that i don't know if that's good or bad i do know that i've had tenured professors that were just sorry
302.848250 307.046875 and i've also had tenure professors that were the best things on two legs
307.046875 314.388625 [silence]
314.388625 316.087000 but in addition
316.087000 317.521125 um-hum
317.521125 322.047375 [silence]
322.047375 329.129500 well they they really can't fire you without cause anymore i mean you know the government's taken care of that
329.129500 332.787375 but uh what i'm looking at is
332.787375 334.474750 you know
334.474750 342.847000 there are a lot of teachers out there that aren't getting paid what they need to be getting paid and there are some teachers out there that aren't worth having around as janitors
342.847000 347.998500 you know and i could see a point protecting someone's position
347.998500 356.465250 but on the other hand i don't think it you know that someone that teaches uh say shop for instance should have to have a a degree at all
356.465250 358.730125 [silence]
358.730125 359.876125 well
359.876125 361.234500 [silence]
361.234500 366.489750 in some places they don't but you know you you've got specialized education now
366.489750 369.415875 for instance take computer science
369.415875 373.345750 you know we've got kids twenty years old
373.345750 376.899000 right now that could beat any computer
376.899000 382.258750 professor at microcomputer applications i know we do
382.258750 388.233500 and these people can't even get jobs doing anything besides digging ditches
388.233500 393.070500 because there's no comprehensive test that they can take
393.070500 399.111375 that would allow them to s[tep]- to step into that position without having to go through the rigamarole of college
399.111375 407.312750 you know i went to college late on in life and i realize that hey you know it's nothing but four years of endurance and you might be teachable you know what i [laughter-mean]
407.312750 408.400875 [laughter]
408.400875 410.819250 i mean my degree is absolutely worthless 
410.819250 418.052000 it's my experience and and my knowledge that that is beneficial but then you know i like i said i came at it backwards
418.052000 420.005000 [silence]
420.005000 421.816500 Industrial Marketing
421.816500 424.071875 [silence]
424.071875 427.907250 well actually i'm selling computer software
427.907250 430.991750 but the two are mutually exclusive
430.991750 433.464375 because the
433.464375 439.620750 it's experience that got me the job that i got now was my experience in the construction field prior to going to college
439.620750 441.631625 not my degree
441.631625 444.135250 which is i think kind of {bizzaro}
444.135250 452.460625 [silence]
452.460625 453.639875 well let's
453.639875 454.653125 [silence]
454.653125 455.750625 that's
455.750625 458.082750 we've already we've already got that
458.082750 474.885500 [silence]
474.885500 475.686625 um-hum
475.686625 479.359125 [silence]
479.359125 481.705625 well yeah
481.705625 485.180500 supervisor evaluation's always been a tough one
485.180500 488.520500 especially in my line because
488.520500 493.637000 you know my supervisor has got really absolutely nothing to do with my job except make sure i get my check
493.637000 495.383750 [laughter]
495.383750 500.225500 [silence]
500.225500 503.368375 well not really
503.368375 506.578375 you know i mean i[t]- there's
506.578375 509.286375 what what's to [evalu/evaluate] -[evalu]ate him on
509.286375 510.777875 you know i mean
510.777875 514.754500 uh my my supervisory level is like practically zero
514.754500 516.783250 i run the whole show
516.783250 522.865875 and when i need something i tell my boss and he gets it for me because_1 he knows that i know what i'm doing
522.865875 524.799875 you know and uh
524.799875 533.030250 that that is something that i think needs to be expanded on specially in the in the large market place you know the major corporation
533.030250 542.139000 because so often you know you get a guy who's got eight or nine or ten people working for him in separate areas so to speak
542.139000 543.151625 [silence]
543.151625 548.215375 you know it's it's hard for me to y[ou]- you know especially since i'm in marketing sales
548.215375 550.245875 you know i make more than my boss [noise]
550.245875 553.468125 because he's salary and i'm not i make as much as i earn
553.468125 555.553625 you know if i don't make a sale i don't make anything
555.553625 556.465875 [laughter]
556.465875 557.378125 [silence]
557.378125 559.796875 yeah well it's a little tough
559.796875 565.769375 but uh you know there are you know requirements and and quotas and what not for me to make
565.769375 569.563250 but uh bottom line on on that kind of thing is
569.563250 576.577250 you know we have a lot of people especially in major corporations who aren't doing a damn thing
576.577250 578.933750 they're just there
578.933750 587.385875 you know the work they do could be totally eliminated and not that they aren't working not that they aren't trying or anything but it's just that their jobs are useless
587.385875 588.583000 [silence]
588.583000 593.583500 you know take for instance um a large construction company i used to work for
593.583500 600.101625 Ed Swampers Swampers' a guy who's in the union he's a laborer and he's assigned to

0.000000 7.576000 [silence]
7.576000 8.816625 uh-huh
8.816625 19.342000 [silence]
19.342000 20.422250 uh-huh
20.422250 54.274750 [silence]
54.274750 55.469750 uh-huh
55.469750 71.092375 [silence]
71.092375 72.589250 oh
72.589250 74.683750 [silence]
74.683750 76.592000 that's very spicy too
76.592000 78.766875 i mean these bell peppers and curry
78.766875 85.052875 [silence]
85.052875 87.401875 oh that sounds really good
87.401875 90.343250 huh i guess it was is this dinner time for you
90.343250 94.893750 [silence]
94.893750 96.366000 all done in advance
96.366000 97.420000 [silence]
97.420000 104.055125 that's um [noise] i uh i'm i'm not that great a cook but i was single until i was thirty so i did cook a little you know
104.055125 105.374250 [silence]
105.374250 112.965500 uh and i cook a little bit now what i like to do mostly is stir fries and my wife normally says oh Tom why why don't you make a stir fry tonight
112.965500 119.749875 so we even we just were recently married so we have a stir fry pan sort of like a big wok
119.749875 122.542125 and we do a lot of um stir fry vegetables
122.542125 125.647000 [silence]
125.647000 136.740000 it's it's called a stir fry pan and it and it fits right on your uh si[t]- it fits right on your burner whether it's gas or electric so it's it has a flatter bottom than a normal wok does
136.740000 145.726125 and um normally what happ[en]- what we do is um just you know like two tablespoons of oil maybe sesame oil or some other type of oil than just regular
145.726125 153.879750 oi[l]- vegetable oil but i will use peanut peanut oil or things and then we just stir fry broccoli and carrots and um green peppers and um
153.879750 162.067125 maybe put in a little bit of um garlic and ginger uh beforehand that gives uh uh uh spicier flavor
162.067125 166.272625 and then after the stir fry is over just mix in um
166.272625 175.953250 a little bit of uh sometimes chicken broth and corn starch and soy sauce and that sort of makes a uh a glaze
175.953250 183.098625 that sticks to the the vegetables i've used you turn them over a lot of times when we do stir fry we just put in tofu we don't put in meat
183.098625 191.252375 cause i guess we're i'm not but uh she likes to watch all the how much red meat and things so we'll do a lot of times vegetarian
191.252375 200.709500 but it's a real good meal because you have squash and broccoli and uh carrots and celery and green peppers and um oh gee mushrooms
200.709500 202.994750 it's it's a pretty big and we put that over rice
202.994750 205.671125 [silence]
205.671125 208.352625 oh you don't [laughter]
208.352625 213.772500 [silence]
213.772500 214.937625 oh
214.937625 216.297500 [silence]
216.297500 217.411000 uh-huh
217.411000 226.319250 yeah see we never in fact i never had squash growing up my my wife eats more vegetables ate more vegetable than i did growing up i'm i'm from Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh is a very meat and potato town
226.319250 230.978375 yeah recipes in Pittsburgh consisted of red meat and a potato
230.978375 233.001000 red meat and a potato
233.001000 245.113750 [silence]

268.126125 273.167500 [silence]
273.167500 277.804750 oh this is terr[ible]- you shouldn't be talking about this right before while you're fixing dinner
277.804750 279.646500 [silence]
279.646500 292.309375 that's right you should be careful [laughter] that's pretty funny but my dad used to tell stories you know about the way they eat chickens but i never we never we lived in the suburbs we we bought everything in a grocery store
292.309375 299.837500 there was no but it was funny you know it so but when we got married you know a lot more vegetables a lot more you know a lot of changes
299.837500 302.342125 [silence]

331.194250 339.591625 she had brought Indian sweets into the office and it was really funny because they were made from yogurt and carrots

1.722375 8.203125 okay in order to make the uh curried chicken i just fried the chicken
8.203125 21.020750 until it was nice and brown you know make sure it's nice and brown on both sides and then you take it out of the fat and you you let the chicken you fried kind of drain so that a lot of the oil comes out of it
21.020750 30.420250 and then you you uh pour most of the all of the oil out of the pan and you kind of clean it out and you put back maybe two tablespoons full of the oil
30.420250 43.052500 and saute some um bell peppers and onions in in that little bit of oil maybe one tablespoon or two tablespoons let that brown then put all of the chicken back in there
43.052500 54.921500 and then you uh mix flour and a cup of water maybe uh one tablespoon of flour and a cup of water stir it real real well
54.921500 55.886750 [silence]
55.886750 60.481500 then you uh pour that in there you know to make the gravy
60.481500 71.584125 and you let it come to a boil again and then you let it simmer and you add uh about a tablespoon of what i'm using now is Jamaican curry powder
71.584125 75.648375 and that's going to it's going to be really good [laughter]

458.650625 460.506125 [noise]

0.000000 0.563875 [noise]
0.563875 7.446875 yes i saw Home Alone with some friends just a couple days ago i wanted to see it uh because it was uh
7.446875 9.345625 much recommended
9.345625 17.723625 uh for months and months and months and it was a a genre that i wasn't in the least bit interested in and i usually when i hear about a movie that's supposed to be very good
17.723625 29.967250 even if it's in a genre i don't like i figure well i should go see it because if this is you know the best of the genre and i should know about it or something like that and i usually come away thinking no i really don't like this [laughter-show] [laughter]
29.967250 32.800750 [laughter]
32.800750 36.884000 [silence]
36.884000 38.075375 yeah
38.075375 43.184875 [silence]
43.184875 45.030000 yeah yeah 
45.030000 59.257125 well the the problem i had with the movie was the problem i've had with a lot of uh i guess Hollywood movies which is you know it's a formula movie and they're making the movie according to a certain formula that's a good formula but they seem to 
59.257125 61.190625 fall short of
61.190625 71.265625 of being really creative with a lot of things i mean here's the situation of this kid at home you know it's a classic slapstick situation with these bungling burglars trying to get in
71.265625 78.965125 and yeah he did some clever things but given the size of the house and how clever the kid was it seems to me they could have done a lot more 
78.965125 87.524000 i mean you know ba[sically]- basically stepping on things and yelling in pain and it seems to me they could have been a lot more creative stuff used 
87.524000 93.790250 [silence]
93.790250 94.956250 uh-huh
94.956250 97.818250 [silence]
97.818250 99.651375 uh-huh uh-huh
99.651375 101.006375 [silence]
101.006375 107.686500 well i guess it was a uh a very successful movie financially so we may say [laughter-more] [laughter-slapstick] [laughter]
107.686500 109.432500 [silence]
109.432500 114.447875 yeah it is it is and i guess you don't have to but you know if you look at
114.447875 121.775375 oh have you ever seen any of the Jacques Teti Teti movies the French movies uh Teti it it
121.775375 142.945625 [silence]
142.945625 144.361625 um
144.361625 152.461875 [silence]
152.461875 155.465750 no i'm not with you so far [laughter]
155.465750 157.599625 [silence]
157.599625 159.378875 [laughter]

164.080125 165.190250 aha 
165.190250 166.565625 [silence]
166.565625 167.490625 uh-huh
167.490625 171.338250 [silence]
171.338250 172.797000 oh yeah
172.797000 176.882625 [silence]
176.882625 188.605500 they have they have a long [vocalized-noise] yes they like Jerry Lewis much to the chagrin of sophisticated Ame[rican]- quote unquote sophisticated American record company but they have this one guy Jacques Teti that does slapstick comedy and there's something about it
188.605500 200.590875 that's so innovative you know he'll have trouble picking up his hat or catching his umbrella blowing in the wind or something but there's something about it that just it isn't just slapstick there's something about the human character in it
200.590875 205.500250 and that's what i find lacking in a lot of you know like Home Alone
205.500250 219.449875 there was a lot of the human character when he was home alone and he was trying to be tough and they s had a lot of human character there but when it was the real slapstick moments him versus the criminals kind of thing it just sort of lost the human element became purely a caricature 
219.449875 221.769125 does does that make since to you
221.769125 227.606875 [noise]
227.606875 230.717250 yeah yeah did you go with kids though
230.717250 232.404750 did you go with kids
232.404750 234.450125 did you take kids along
234.450125 236.982375 [silence]
236.982375 238.280250 ah
238.280250 248.514125 oh i would have liked to have a kid with me i think preferably someone seven or eight just just to get a sense for you know how how it affected them
248.514125 255.775250 especially to come home and you know [laughter] [vocalized-noise] [laughter-if] [laughter-he] [laughter-didn't] [laughter-knock] [laughter-real] [laughter-loudly] [laughter-and] [laughter-clearly] i would have gotten in trouble the next day i'm sure
255.775250 269.468875 [silence]
269.468875 273.548500 oh Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles huh um-hum 
273.548500 275.164250 um-hum 
275.164250 276.359250 [silence]
276.359250 278.162875 and your cousin's a kid
278.162875 279.425000 uh-huh
279.425000 284.808625 [silence]
284.808625 287.281375 yeah wasn't it amazing
287.281375 288.730500 [silence]
288.730500 289.816625 yeah those
289.816625 304.372000 yeah it was all bloodless and the good guys can get hit all day long and they have to shake it off they don't they don't you know get [vocalized-noise] epileptic fits or anything from getting hit on the head
304.372000 306.659875 yeah it it's a little disturbing
306.659875 315.148875 the violence in these films part[ly]- it mean it's supposed to be a little bit more okay because it's comic book but on the other hand it makes it seem like
315.148875 326.731000 i i read an article one time talking about even the quote unquote realistic movies don't have very realistic effects of the violence the violence can seem very realistic but the aftermath is usually not there
326.731000 329.536000 if you see people who are severely injured it's
329.536000 344.401375 very very badly they lose control of body functions they thrash around they scream you know uh it's just a very very bad thing and they never present that even the movies that want to show violence as real they don't really show you what happens with that real violence
344.401375 348.399500 and i'm not really sure how i feel about that
348.399500 359.918500 uh on the one hand i'd like it to be a warning on the other hand i wouldn't want people who currently get sort of enjoy their violence fixes from these movies to start thinking gee now we want to see the aftermath all the time either
359.918500 364.461375 [silence]
364.461375 377.368000 but yeah T[eenage]- Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is sort of the same way they i guess they figured i mean they know what they're doing and they make the movies good enough i guess i'm a bit of a snob they make the movies good enough to be successful 
377.368000 385.292625 and then they don't and they but they could make them better you know they could try to make i mean as far as i was concerned Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles could have been a classic of world theater
385.292625 397.478125 [vocalized-noise] it could have been you know it was it was innovative uh a completely new approach to making a movie in a lot of ways and yet it ended up not being anything particularly memorable
397.478125 404.614125 cause the the story was stupid and and then things like that and uh they built up i remember feeling annoyed
404.614125 406.726500 again i didn't have a kid with me
406.726500 419.696125 and i remember feeling annoyed that they had this whole thing about the master and the passing of wisdom the from older to younger generation it was it was a classic Greek you know it's European mess going back three thousand years that they're playing with
419.696125 426.573375 um and he had to pa[st]- and he told them remember [vocalized-noise] remember you
426.573375 434.981125 [vocalized-noise] united you can succeed individually you will fail and then there was a big climactic fight scene and they didn't remember that
434.981125 440.960375 they didn't fight together they fought individually and they failed individually and then that was it then they had to have the master beat him
440.960375 447.342000 and the master should according to the classic myth the sort of Joseph Campbell type myth
447.342000 458.342000 the master should have died at the end because the the lesson was passed to the young generation and the older generation is not needed and is reborn to the younger generation and on and on and on and all this wonderful myth
458.342000 463.162000 and it still would have been every bit as accessible a movie for the kids
463.162000 466.445750 if they had included all this stuff that
466.445750 473.592750 i anyway as an as intellectual adult would appreciate it wouldn't have hurt the movie to do that and it would have make it uh
473.592750 477.327250 broadened the audience that it could have been targeted for i thought
477.327250 486.657625 but i um i'm i'm clearly enough you know i'm i'm clearly an intellectual snob to be going to these kinds of movies i realize that
486.657625 493.113875 i mean to go to these movies and expect them to be you know other than just just good entertainment kind of thing
493.113875 501.500500 [silence]
501.500500 511.572500 yeah yeah i i i i'm very i'm very critical [noise] i i i'm actually originally from Hollywood and then then then and my father works in films and such and i tend to
511.572500 520.211000 tend to be hypercritical of these things and then perhaps perhaps it's unfair because i i i must admit i enjoy these movies um
520.211000 522.636750 and th[at]- that's what they're for
522.636750 524.541750 but i don't don't remember them
524.541750 534.730625 and i think it's i think i can think of movies i have less fun during and then after the movie's over i remember it so terribly well because it it had some some meaning to me or something
534.730625 542.228000 [silence]
542.228000 543.629375 um-hum

552.528625 554.234625 but it just
554.234625 566.231250 i mean i don't know if this is old fart talking here or something because_1 i'm not that old [laughter] [laughter-i] [laughter-look] you know those old movies seemed to have had something that uh that was memorable somehow i don't know what it was
566.231250 569.790750 [silence]
569.790750 576.651000 okay well um [laughter] thanks for hearing me ramp i guess [laughter] all right nice talking with you

40.244750 44.200250 you know end up with expectations too high or whatever

94.225375 100.919250 you know a lot of the comedies are more like jokes and you know gags and stuff like that there's not as much slapstick anymore

104.619000 105.914500 uh-huh
105.914500 110.571250 yeah that well that's true it's very cheap to make a slapstick movie

117.422625 118.840625 excuse me
118.840625 123.586625 no not really the last movie i saw i guess uh was uh

130.783125 134.740250 he's uh uh well it's about a man uh
134.740250 143.188500 that uh leaves his home and comes back to his wife and his wife's all excited but the guy that comes back is not her original husband
143.188500 144.840000 but um
144.840000 152.447375 [vocalized-noise] Gear um i'm sure you've heard of it it was a very famous uh popular movie Norman Gray Norman Gear
152.447375 154.011500 um
154.011500 158.631125 oh shoot i'm going to hit myself after i hang up i'll remember the name
158.631125 167.644375 but uh anyway that was a French movie it was um that was the last one i saw downtown but i i live in DC well actually Falls Church Virginia outside the city
167.644375 172.700375 and uh so a lot of times they the the the international films downtown
172.700375 178.877250 but uh so this uh French i guess are into the slapsti[ck]- i guess so they would like Jerry Lewis yeah [laughter]

222.413500 229.052625 yeah i see what you're saying there is less character development rather just the the the funniness of the gag rather than

91.924000 97.981000 [silence]
97.981000 101.381875 well i sort of one of the reasons it's taken so long is i've been working
101.381875 107.642125 uh you know it's sort of half student half working and source of income and stuff so i'm actually managing to do this with zero debt
107.642125 111.235500 uh i couldn't you you couldn't do it otherwise
111.235500 120.207375 [silence]
120.207375 127.751250 yeah i think if there's any major piece of advice i'd give is to find a way of getting an education that doesn't incur that kind of debt
127.751250 137.960125 it's not i mean i remember seeing an article one time about you know if the average person who spent that much money going to college just took the same amount of money and put it in a a in an investment fund 
137.960125 145.484625 they'd be considerably wealthier than they would be from the [laughter] job they'd get after college so it's it's really kind of crazy

214.939875 216.942250 [silence]
216.942250 219.420000 well my my real feeling about
219.420000 223.141000 about the purpose of undergraduate education is
223.141000 229.432375 it's really the time yes you do get an education you do learn some things but you eventually forget most of it
229.432375 234.927125 but what you don't forget is the growing up it's really the period when people become adults
234.927125 248.265250 i mean people who don't go to college become adults in other ways but really it's the entry into adulthood i think and i think that the best way to choose a college is to decide what kind of environment you want to
248.265250 250.628000 be fostered in as you become
250.628000 256.621875 you know as you gain new social skills as you become you know more of a functioning member of society
256.621875 266.153000 and maybe the Air Force Academy is appropriate as you said for someone who you know a more you know who needs to learn self-discipline and so forth would be appropriate for them
266.153000 272.618625 [silence]
272.618625 275.000500 yeah and want to develop that

345.453000 347.041375 [laughter]
347.041375 354.362500 yeah the the one thing i think that's no good for anyone is these monster institutions these institutions of th[irty]- thirty thousand students
354.362500 357.446375 [vocalized-noise] and i see some freshmen wandering around in there and they're
357.446375 361.240625 they're just like you know someone from the country lost in the big city i mean they
361.240625 363.455250 they i don't see them getting
363.455250 370.148625 i mean when i was undergraduate i went to a relatively small school for my first two years and then i transferred to a very large school
370.148625 375.120125 and that worked out pretty well i went from a you know a second rate institution to a higher rate institution
375.120125 387.377000 but the first couple of years it doesn't matter to me what the quality of the education was i needed to make friends i needed to sort of learn the ropes you know there were things like that that mattered a lot more and i needed basic really simple education that you can get
387.377000 390.415500 pretty much anywhere for the first couple of years
390.415500 393.906250 yeah yeah exactly and if you're alienated
393.906250 401.794750 i mean i see people at supposedly really good universities who are just having such psychological problems that you think this isn't sinking in
401.794750 403.670125 [noise]

464.243625 464.834000 well i
464.834000 467.660000 i had known a lot of undergraduates who pick
467.660000 475.368250 schools because they want the best reputation for a school not realizing that the reputation for MIT is because of the of the doctorate research
475.368250 482.017625 and the professors who go there and you're not going to see the professors [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter-you're] [laughter-going] [laughter-to] see some TA you know uh
482.017625 492.136375 so they put they they want you know they want the best and they don't think they think what the best is is reputation for for research and that's a one standard but it's not relevant to what they need
492.136375 503.431500 [silence]
503.431500 504.439500 uh-huh
504.439500 505.604625 [silence]
505.604625 507.080625 um-hum um-hum

541.540250 550.388125 [silence]
550.388125 551.857125 hm 
551.857125 563.885250 yeah you won't get that at MIT or Berkeley or anything like that and you can and you know you can't blame the professors either because you look at their job description you'd see you know teaching is third down on the list of importance things and
563.885250 571.783500 yeah and and that's appropriate if the university is trying to do serious research because it's hard to be a researcher and a teacher at the same time
571.783500 578.041250 so i'd say go to a go to a college that has teachers people who really are committed to the students and can afford to be because that's their job
578.041250 579.059875 [silence]
579.059875 582.515375 but oh well [laughter]
582.515375 586.965375 [silence]

2.771375 11.540000 [silence]
11.540000 14.329375 well i'd encourage it
14.329375 17.577375 it's a good general e[ducation]- ed[ucation]- education for a
17.577375 19.670250 a bachelor's degree
19.670250 22.247250 and obviously and obviously it's where they don't have a
22.247250 25.636000 any post graduate program there but you get a
25.636000 27.314375 an excellent
27.314375 29.087375 wide
29.087375 39.130625 uh basis of topics you know you get a good broad education out of it you don't they don't graduate the best engineers or the best English majors but
39.130625 42.924125 maybe a graduate pretty good overall students out of there
42.924125 44.511875 um
44.511875 52.445250 [silence]
52.445250 54.965000 well the
54.965000 60.378625 for some people it's good because they maybe they need a little discipline need a little reining in at that
60.378625 65.754875 that stage in their life uh other people it uh it's
65.754875 69.966125 uh suffocating you know you kind of choke on it um
69.966125 76.179250 it it depends on the person on the individual but uh the one factor i think
76.179250 81.180625 more than anything else in this day and age that's got to
81.180625 84.834625 be a big factor in your decision's just the the cost of
84.834625 86.467250 how much you're gonna pay
86.467250 88.483500 no matter where you go to school
88.483500 95.380500 and if you've been in for twelve years i'm sure you've you've got a your share of student loans that uh you're
95.380500 98.501875 probably going to be paying off or have been or
98.501875 101.476625 [silence]
101.476625 102.493000 uh-huh
102.493000 107.017875 [silence]
107.017875 108.698500 oh that's good
108.698500 110.313625 [silence]
110.313625 113.192750 oh yeah i mean i know people that graduated
113.192750 120.346750 or that i went to high school with that went to civilian colleges and they they've got twenty thirty thousand dollar debts i mean you could have uh
120.346750 127.025750 [silence]
127.025750 128.412875 yeah
128.412875 141.428000 [silence]
141.428000 143.035500 exactly
143.035500 145.181750 [silence]
145.181750 148.503000 it's it's staggering when you think that just
148.503000 155.862125 here in central New York is uh Hamilton College is just a few miles south of you know maybe about twenty miles to the south
155.862125 158.032000 from where i am and uh
158.032000 162.651875 they're looking for twenty two thousand dollars for tuition and room and board now
162.651875 163.731500 a year
163.731500 165.414250 at just a small
165.414250 169.280875 i mean they they they are s[elect]- it is a select college
169.280875 171.534375 [silence]
171.534375 182.951875 oh yeah but you're talking incredible tuitions now i don't know how many people actually pay the whole shot very few i would imagine but uh
182.951875 194.851000 i get i- i just couldn't ima[gine]- i mean it's more money than i make in a year so [laughter] you know it you know me being one person with a above the median
194.851000 199.935375 income for New York state you know i'm a s[econd]- i'm a second lieutenant in the Air Force now and uh
199.935375 202.453750 i e[ven]- even as a
202.453750 205.482750 somebody making twice what i was making how could you
205.482750 207.604875 put half of that into
207.604875 214.356500 to your child's education and then just when they make made make it to the college years it's
214.356500 217.621625 my God i can't imagine
217.621625 228.569000 [silence]
228.569000 229.974375 yes
229.974375 240.892875 [silence]
240.892875 242.434500 i'd
242.434500 264.340250 [silence]
264.340250 265.158375 or
265.158375 271.212375 or it's also a good environment it may be good for someone who already has self-discipline who has a certain amount of
271.212375 274.014625 leadership quality in their own
274.014625 279.208125 and that yeah the s[ame]- it's the same it can benefit different people different ways but uh
279.208125 281.982375 you know i- i agree with that because_1 i see people
281.982375 288.157750 that i know a again from high school that i still keep in touch with that didn't go to college and 
288.157750 290.899750 they do the same old things they did in high school
290.899750 291.890750 and
291.890750 294.554750 same patterns of behavior same
294.554750 303.347500 uh same socializing same exact crowd that they hang with and it's like it's like frozen time [laughter-you] [laughter-know]
303.347500 304.991875 [silence]
304.991875 309.931875 it is it really is that they haven't found anything anything better that
309.931875 316.834750 um or their experiences haven't been broadened at all that you know its a
316.834750 318.402625 [silence]
318.402625 326.660625 it's a tremendous thing when you sit in a in a college environment and discuss some issues and really sit there with people with disagreeing opinions and you hear
326.660625 329.078500 all these different sides of the story
329.078500 330.607500 that you never thought of
330.607500 337.175500 and uh that's another big thing i think people get out of college is the appreciation for
337.175500 341.901625 different point differing points of view you know or different opinions
341.901625 343.963375 [silence]
343.963375 345.875250 yeah exactly
345.875250 347.025750 yeah
347.025750 353.824750 [silence]
353.824750 354.953625 oh i

383.226500 388.010250 [silence]
388.010250 391.972125 well your education's a lot what you make of it too so
391.972125 397.920750 [silence]
397.920750 398.996875 yeah
398.996875 400.372250 [silence]
400.372250 404.074250 well i i've seen more graduates from MIT and that being
404.074250 408.750875 i work in a in a labora[tory]- an Air Force laboratory and so we've got a lot of uh
408.750875 410.754625 MIT graduates that are in there
410.754625 417.483125 and they are the biggest collection of screwed up people that [laughter-i] [laughter-think] [laughter-i've] [laughter-ever] [laughter-run] [laughter-into] even even more so
417.483125 424.336875 uh like military academy grads are a strange lot too i- i mean i have to ad[mit]- confess to that
424.336875 429.560000 yeah and they they have their own quirks and tolerances and
429.560000 430.529625 you know
430.529625 439.962875 certain things that don't bother us at all that would drive other people nuts and then certain things that ways things we do the way we do it that drive other people nuts that
439.962875 445.791500 but these MIT grads are off in their absolute own world it it's a
445.791500 452.189875 i- i have more re[spect]- i have a lot of respect for MIT master's and doctorate uh
452.189875 456.612750 degrees but but their undergrads are like
456.612750 462.014625 i i'm amazed at at that's a lot of them_1 even graduated
462.014625 463.803875 but uh
463.803875 465.087250 i don't know
465.087250 469.992250 [silence]
469.992250 471.080250 right
471.080250 474.978000 [silence]

475.982250 477.628625 [silence]
477.628625 478.469000 nope
478.469000 480.743750 [silence]
480.743750 481.590125 the [vocalized-noise]
481.590125 486.180000 [silence]
486.180000 487.512625 yeah
487.512625 490.448875 [silence]
490.448875 491.525625 no
491.525625 498.056375 it's interesting that you mention that i didn't think about that before when you were talking but the service academies have all
498.056375 503.491250 all the faculty uh for the most part is is military with a few exchange
503.491250 505.591375 instruct professors from other
505.591375 506.958000 schools but
506.958000 513.363250 uh having the military faculty is really beneficial because they see it as
513.363250 525.306875 doing their job and spending time with the cadets there uh is investing in the Air Force and it or the the military itself it's the future officer corps and so
525.306875 528.094000 i hear horr[or]- horror stories from 
528.094000 532.804750 friends of mine that they could never see their instructors they could never get extra help
532.804750 537.353875 for me any time i needed extra help any time of the day
537.353875 546.073250 i had all my instructors home phone numbers and could call them you go to their office anytime i had some instructors that uh
546.073250 548.958375 would invite me over to their house for extended
548.958375 552.714375 study things on weekends when i was having trouble with something and
552.714375 554.177125 [silence]
554.177125 555.817875 no no and that
555.817875 559.971625 [silence]
559.971625 561.375750 no
561.375750 565.430750 [laughter-right] right publish first and then [laughter]

578.542875 580.492125 [silence]
580.492125 584.705500 yeah it's there's a lot of factors that people
584.705500 587.661375 don't ever ever consider
587.661375 592.840000 in in their selection of a college and uh i don't know maybe
592.840000 598.630000 i wonder if if they enter these conversations that people have been having um that

0.000000 0.600000 [noise]
0.600000 6.138625 so i guess a good question to ask is do you do your own work or do you do you like to do it
6.138625 26.618125 [silence]
26.618125 27.956000 yeah
27.956000 36.276000 [silence]
36.276000 42.149125 yeah so do you have a do you have a garden or do you just do your landscaping now and your lawn
42.149125 81.577000 [silence]
81.577000 87.180500 well that's pretty good my my sister is very over zealous too she's got
87.180500 93.221375 some really nice flowerbeds she puts a lot of time into them_1 this is my first year in a in a house where i
93.221375 96.460125 thinking about doing some flowerbeds and stuff
96.460125 105.744750 oh we i've always had crude ones at my father's but this is the first time that i really have to landscape a house his house is more like a farmhouse its not on a main road
105.744750 117.168125 my house is on a main road and it has nothing [laughter] i mean nothing [laughter] but uh what i do do is now i've always done it at my father's house
117.168125 122.177500 we have my sister and i have a couple of gardens i think we figured out total
122.177500 122.864500 um
122.864500 128.548500 this is for vegetables about two thirds of an acre so we each have a third of an acre we do
128.548500 130.063375 that's a lot
130.063375 131.577250 [laughter]

141.754250 150.162875 um it just happens they built a shopping center next to it [laughter] but um they put up a nice fence so we still have a lot of privacy
150.162875 152.105625 and we grow a lot of food
152.105625 154.000625 uh i enjoy it
154.000625 159.507500 um the gardens are kind of old you have to step down in them_1 now that the
159.507500 162.688000 and we've tilled them_1 so much but they're still
162.688000 169.255500 we we my sister uses plenty of fertilizer i don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing

256.801000 267.836125 a lot of the the ba[ck]- the back work and stuff but she does she helps me a lot too she puts a lot of financial she plans it all out
267.836125 280.328875 beans like to be near certain types of plants now they they find that tomatoes don't do well if you put them next to something like uh peas i don't know something
280.328875 281.844125 [silence]
281.844125 290.554750 no it's just like something like an onion and a tomato would go together but you're not supposed to put your onions near your beans i guess it's
290.554750 295.409750 it it's just what scents it gives off they just don't like each other
295.409750 303.623875 i mean [laughter] she she reads all kinds of books so i wish i knew more to tell you why but
303.623875 310.457500 [silence]

339.538125 346.216625 but i don't think the vines they don't really they don't have to be touching or anything like you say they cross pollinate just by bees 
346.216625 347.449500 [silence]
347.449500 348.705375 oh
348.705375 349.970250 i know

354.351375 359.504000 this year we didn't this last season it was it was too wet up here
359.504000 371.764625 we lost a lot of oh uh root things our oh uh our squash and our potatoes and we got half our yield it was really bad because_1 of the water
371.764625 391.266625 [silence]
391.266625 392.895875 y[eah]- yeah
392.895875 396.567250 [silence]
396.567250 403.433375 yeah i- i have to do that i want to make some flowerbeds and i'm going to have a seven yard truck come in
403.433375 405.260000 with some topsoil
405.260000 416.069125 and i'm going to a my problem is i want to use those railroad ties to build up a planter but i don't know if the creosote in the railroad ties is going to do something 
416.069125 422.458625 to uh you know if i want to grow a tomato or something in there [laughter] i- i mean i guess it'd go for my flowers but
422.458625 428.985250 [silence]
428.985250 439.953000 yeah i don't i don't i just don't think you i always thought i'd put a tomato plant in there or something weird but i don't think i could really eat the fruit off it without wondering
439.953000 443.986375 and i don't know if they make landscape ties that aren't treated
443.986375 446.952125 [silence]
446.952125 448.400000 yeah but they put some kind of
448.400000 449.876000 chemicals in there too
449.876000 451.019250 [silence]
451.019250 460.347250 yeah well i'm not really worried about it it's mainly for flower bed so i'm not going to not goi[ng]- i'm just not going to put that tomato plant in there 
460.347250 467.515125 but i yeah i do want to have a raised bed i've never i my flower gardens have always been like on the ground
467.515125 468.916875 they don't
468.916875 473.000000 it just looks so much better when it's up against the house tiered up
473.000000 475.495000 [silence]
475.495000 484.292375 yeah this house that i have is just a three bedroom ranch and i can tell you there's nothing around it cement foundation all the way round it not a shrub not a bush
484.292375 487.628000 there was a lilac tree and the landlord cut it down and
487.628000 497.876125 said yep that's one thing you have to do summer keep that lilac bush cut down so it doesn't rub up against the siding and i'm looking at him like jeez people would kill to have a lilac bush
497.876125 507.500750 and he's cutting it down [laughter] so that's all right flower beds are all right anything as long as it doesn't rub up against the siding
507.500750 514.496125 yep that's what he's worried about the trees or a bush because lilac bushes they they grow fast
514.496125 523.578375 some people uh would really like to have them_1 and then the people that do have them_1 they spread and they sprout all over th[eir]- their lawn
523.578375 529.720000 so they're kind of a pain but you know people who don't have them_1 think they're great and people who do have them_1
529.720000 531.685500 cur[se]- curse
531.685500 542.254500 another thing i have that um is weird is these a locus tree in the backyard as a matter of fact there's three of them very badly trimmed they aren't trimmed at all
542.254500 546.803625 and i can imagine if i had to mow the lawn in the back which we said we'd do
546.803625 553.825375 if the trees hang down so low and the locus trees have like three quarters of an inch thorns [laughter-on] [laughter-it] so
553.825375 556.012250 [silence]
556.012250 566.940000 they're a pretty tree but you just when you walk up to them_1 they're covered with thorns so we're going to get a chain saw and we're going to limb limb it extensively so it the trees up overhead
566.940000 568.268250 [silence]
568.268250 575.992750 yeah [laughter] because i can just see brushing up against it that it would rip your skin it's worse than a r[ose]- a rose bush
575.992750 578.455625 many times worse because_1 of course it's a tree
578.455625 581.539500 [silence]
581.539500 590.126750 yep my uh dad used to work on them_1 so i don't think i'll have a problem my husband will have problem borrowing one
590.126750 592.841000 [laughter] even
592.841000 595.650500 [silence]
595.650500 598.656000 well if that's not the problem it

7.974125 11.403750 about a or just over a year ago i bought my
11.403750 22.124500 my own house so this has been the first opportunity i've had to uh be working on my own lawn and garden and uh you know
22.124500 36.959625 back when i was a kid you know mom would send me out to weed the garden i i'd hate it you know now i sort of take pride in uh in the yard and you know how the how the place looks and uh so i don't mind doing it so much anymore
36.959625 39.873250 [silence]
39.873250 52.298625 well it's yeah it's it's primarily just uh like landscaping a little bit you know i've got some uh bushes around the fou[ndation]- you know the foundation planting things like that and then there's some uh
52.298625 62.602000 uh just some little flowerbeds and my mom grows she's an avid gardener and she starts her own stuff from seed now and uh
62.602000 71.261750 she gets a little over zealous when she is planting these seeds in the winter time and and starting them_1 uh
71.261750 83.066000 she ends up with so many plants that she can't fit them_1 all in her garden they have a huge yard and a huge house and so she brings them_1 up here from Philadelphia and gives me all her extras

312.641875 317.090250 and we ended up with these these like
317.090250 325.137875 things on the cantaloupe vines that i mean were looked like round big huge round cucumbers

9.899750 13.843000 [silence]
13.843000 22.902375 well i think it's a good idea i think our justice system needs a major overhaul and i'm not sure what needs to be done to fix it but i think they've got a lot of problems
22.902375 28.060375 [silence]
28.060375 29.703125 true
29.703125 42.455375 [silence]

46.495875 48.008250 [laughter]
48.008250 52.695000 yeah do you would you prefer all trials by a judge
52.695000 86.266000 [silence]
86.266000 95.879875 yeah i would agree with that i think you're right i think they sometimes get carried away by the circumstances and make huge settlements thinking well it's only going to cost the insurance company and
95.879875 106.580750 [silence]
106.580750 107.927250 uh-huh
107.927250 108.932625 [silence]
108.932625 116.621500 if they give them_1 all the information i don't know when it comes to sentencing phase i guess they tell them_1 if a guy if the person has a previous record and stuff
116.621500 122.807125 sometimes it seems like during the trial part the jury's not you know misses some of the best evidence because they make them_1 leave and
122.807125 125.636250 the judge decides whether or not they should hear it
125.636250 134.016375 [silence]

162.493750 163.976625 oh
163.976625 167.730125 some of them_1 disagree i mean some of them_1 said one way and some the other
167.730125 173.736125 [silence]
173.736125 176.181250 i think it does have to be unanimous
176.181250 178.987125 [silence]
178.987125 184.349875 i know they can poll a jury make sure everybody agrees with what they said the verdict was but
184.349875 187.981125 i thought that they all had to [laughter-agree] or else they it was a hung jury
187.981125 188.737500 and
188.737500 193.782625 yeah i thi[nk]- i don't know how i feel about that i think maybe uh
193.782625 196.478750 majority might be sufficient
196.478750 199.291875 it's hard to say though i
199.291875 202.571875 [silence]
202.571875 204.051625 oh

223.110375 232.000000 [silence]
232.000000 237.098625 yeah i think maybe they'd need to be more knowledgeable though than just your average Joe off the street
237.098625 240.757125 for something like that because of the cultural differences
240.757125 242.489500 things like that
242.489500 247.506375 [silence]
247.506375 250.875750 yeah what about uniform sentencing
250.875750 256.013250 [silence]
256.013250 262.923750 right yeah like if you're convicted of a certain crime you automatically get so many years it's not a discretionary thing
262.923750 266.477000 [silence]
266.477000 267.721500 [vocalized-noise]

276.545750 278.174500 yeah
278.174500 283.894625 i wish that when they sentence someone if they're going to sentence him to five years then make him serve five years
283.894625 285.360750 you know
285.360750 289.514000 [silence]

306.762375 309.949250 yeah i don't believe that [laughter-very] [laughter-often] [laughter-happens]
309.949250 313.464375 [silence]
313.464375 318.391500 i don't think so either In fact i think they end up worse because the conditions are so bad
318.391500 319.963250 yeah
319.963250 321.040000 [silence]
321.040000 332.233375 i think i think maybe they ought to just be punished with some some kind of real punishment like hard labor for a shorter length of time you know actually make them_1 do something that's not pleasant
332.233375 342.122500 and do it and get it over with and get back in the you know world and not spend so much time sitting around letting the bad influences of the other ones rub off on them_1 and
342.122500 343.666125 yeah
343.666125 352.284750 [silence]
352.284750 356.667875 yeah something besides license plates and [laughter-tiddlywinks]
356.667875 358.026750 yeah
358.026750 359.036750 [silence]
359.036750 360.511500 yeah
360.511500 362.722750 [silence]
362.722750 364.823750 well i think that covers it
364.823750 366.464250 it was nice talking to you
366.464250 367.667875 um bye
367.667875 369.217625 you too [noise] bye
369.217625 370.434000 [noise]


0.000000 2.126750 [silence]
2.126750 7.633250 never i've never been served on the jury never been called up in a jury although some of my friends have been jurors
7.633250 9.296750 [silence]
9.296750 14.395250 you haven't huh if you were uh what do you think about the whole concept of a trial by your peers
14.395250 22.429750 [silence]
22.429750 28.979875 i think the major thing they need to [noise] correct is how long it takes something to get to jury and to get to trial
28.979875 34.099625 and i don't know if that's just a pure volumes number or or what but uh
34.099625 43.103875 sometimes i think the jury is ignorant in the facts of law and how things should be determined and they're too easily swayed by their emotion
43.103875 46.941625 hence is possible error as you can see in all the ironsides
46.941625 48.810500 TV shows
48.810500 52.007625 [silence]
52.007625 64.997000 no i think there are certain things that uh the jury can determine as far as uh guilty or not guilty but as far as the aff[ixing]- aff[ixing]- affixing of punishment and fines and things of that nature 
64.997000 77.550750 [noise] i don't know if that is best left up to the jury to de[cide]- to award you know two point two million dollar kind of settlement versus a judge knowing you know it's true that you know this may be sad and all that thing but uh
77.550750 87.248750 the jury i think is best in most cases suited for determination of guilt and innocence but not the award of of penalties and fines and punishment
87.248750 94.697250 [silence]
94.697250 96.265250 um-hum
96.265250 106.841375 that's true but uh i do like the idea of the jury being the the the people who decide in the matter of uh if it's a jail term versus life and death
106.841375 108.982375 you know the death penalty and such
108.982375 115.738125 [silence]
115.738125 117.325750 uh-huh
117.325750 122.630750 [silence]
122.630750 123.847375 right
123.847375 124.941750 [silence]
124.941750 134.663500 yeah uh it it it's kind of difficult and i guess the whole system is set up to rather let uh some guilty people go free than to put an innocent person in in jail
134.663500 137.528250 although you still hear about those occasionally
137.528250 141.264625 [silence]
141.264625 150.510125 um i don't know i you know i heard a very interesting and maybe it's just the TV show or movie i was watching they were going through a trial
150.510125 156.542625 and i think it was like on one of the the documentary TV shows where they ask for the the verdict by the jury
156.542625 160.652000 and they went by each one saying guilty or innocent guilty or innocent
160.652000 163.375375 and they took it more as just like a majority
163.375375 164.928000 so i- i
164.928000 166.734250 [silence]
166.734250 174.293750 exactly but they took you know whatever the majority was so i didn't know if that was just something for drama or that's truly the way it is i always thought it had to be unanimous
174.293750 175.728125 [silence]
175.728125 177.164000 but uh
177.164000 179.136500 rather interesting
179.136500 187.308750 [silence]
187.308750 189.886875 uh-huh i did i did also
189.886875 195.100125 [silence]
195.100125 196.069875 [noise]
196.069875 197.326875 uh-huh
197.326875 198.265000 [silence]
198.265000 200.582125 what about in international
200.582125 204.425250 trials do you think they should have a jury there i think that would be kind of interesting
204.425250 207.149875 [silence]
207.149875 213.208375 i guess the the problem with that is there's no true authority in any kind of international verdicts
213.208375 220.514625 like you know the old day with the rack we they're going to say okay you're guilty and you have to pay Kuwait four million dollars well whose going to really make them_1
220.514625 221.878250 nobody
221.878250 222.727750 [silence]
222.727750 223.896000 so
223.896000 229.964250 but i think it would be kind of interesting to incorporate that concept of you know [vocalized-noise] people from different countries
229.964250 233.018500 uh in as international law also
233.018500 236.460000 [silence]
236.460000 237.827750 um-hum
237.827750 239.945125 [silence]
239.945125 241.204125 right
241.204125 242.235625 [silence]
242.235625 246.070625 i don't know how what it would take to be come up with a true perfect
246.070625 248.674125 system or if one exists but
248.674125 250.499625 [silence]
250.499625 257.199000 uh is that the crime and it's already [vocalized-noise] false due to some chart and determine the punishment or
257.199000 262.242000 [silence]
262.242000 268.065000 um-hum [noise] i think there should be a core minimum that they get but uh
268.065000 278.049625 i guess there should be some flexibility because_1 every situation may be unique that the judge can either increase that or keep it just at its minimum things of that nature
278.049625 279.467625 i
279.467625 283.444000 [silence]
283.444000 290.378125 yeah that serves a kind of if they're i guess uh if you sentence someone to life life is only forty nine years something like that 
290.378125 295.833500 and i guess you're eligible after twenty seven for parole even though you're in for life 
295.833500 299.779125 [silence]
299.779125 307.491250 yeah although i guess it's you you want them_1 to rehabilitate and become better rather than sitting in there and being a drain all the time
307.491250 308.913625 [silence]
308.913625 314.740375 no because uh inside the jail there i don't think there's no real rehabilitation it just
314.740375 317.424750 [silence]
317.424750 319.457000 yes it's another war zone
319.457000 320.749500 but
320.749500 322.100500 who knows
322.100500 328.685375 [silence]
328.685375 331.118500 i agree get them_1 out there
331.118500 340.456625 [silence]
340.456625 353.294250 sure they should have them_1 go out and doing stuff cleaning up or picking up dirt or weeds or who knows what something for the for the state since the state is paying for them_1 they should get some kind of kind of work out of them
353.294250 355.797500 [silence]
355.797500 357.256750 exactly
357.256750 359.610375 trading their lives for cigarettes
359.610375 361.482250 those kinds of things
361.482250 363.004375 well good
363.004375 364.007625 [silence]

1.013750 4.257250 [silence]
4.257250 16.080500 well i guess i'm maybe naive but i never did feel that Russia was a big threat to us i mean obviously there's the the the possibility of or was the possibility of war
16.080500 26.345125 uh but i somehow think that war is one of those things that maybe is inevitable but uh
26.345125 32.500250 i don't look at it as a threat in the same sense that that i think this question was meant what about you
32.500250 34.630375 [silence]

183.081875 184.349375 uh-huh
184.349375 190.318625 but i guess there was concern uh that I[raq]- Iraq would use
190.318625 199.241375 you know nonconventional warheads with with the chemical weapons and things but yet it didn't happen i mean why not
199.241375 212.367000 [silence]
212.367000 213.699875 uh-huh
213.699875 218.952875 [silence]
218.952875 223.404000 oh so you think it was fear that kept Iraq from using it but yet the

226.228375 227.332125 [noise]

248.053125 251.505750 [silence]
251.505750 254.675750 right i don't think we've done that to Saddam Hussein yet
254.675750 259.587875 [laughter] i think that's that's that's not very likely
259.587875 270.517375 but yet you know as as the parallel Russia is that Saddam Hussein is using the chemical warfare on his own people and i guess that makes sense what you said that
270.517375 277.505625 uh within their own borders they feel freer to do what what they feel necessary
277.505625 278.857375 yeah
278.857375 290.557000 [silence]
290.557000 291.847250 uh-huh

324.239625 325.476875 [silence]
325.476875 332.379250 well or that that it resolves anything in the end that that negotiations couldn't resolve
332.379250 339.976250 [silence]
339.976250 341.946375 uh-huh uh-huh
341.946375 343.717625 uh-huh
343.717625 349.447750 well it sounds like neither one of us thinks that the Soviet Union is a real threat to the US
349.447750 363.252750 [silence]
363.252750 364.962125 right

0.000000 0.481000 [noise]
0.481000 4.856875 all righty so uh do you think Russia's still a threat
4.856875 10.248625 [silence]
10.248625 11.851500 [noise] there you go
11.851500 31.837875 [silence]
31.837875 35.429625 well i think h[ave]- have you ever read the book Nineteen Eighty Four 
35.429625 41.055500 okay you know like how uh these two there was like three continents that were always fighting with each other
41.055500 51.698875 right and you could picture it as being Russia versus the US d[uring]- during the whole time and what they would do is they would get their prisoners and kill them as soon as they got them
51.698875 60.508750 because the people there could realize that they were the same as as themselves you know the prisoners of wars were were the same as the people living in that country
60.508750 71.057500 and you didn't want that to happen and to me it had always been that way i mean what happens is you have a government right and this government controls everything right
71.057500 79.094875 and then you have the people inhabiting the country and these people have nothing to do with the government itself and these people are the same as you are
79.094875 91.532000 and what goes on is that every time somebody attacks a country supposedly US or Russia attacks a country it's not going to be within the borders of the US or Russia itself
91.532000 98.631000 like i was telling people i'm really mad because the whole thing in the Middle East this was going on in Lith[uania]- in Lithuania
98.631000 101.931500 they they were announced to be a separate country
101.931500 112.969000 but yet the the government that's in Moscow told its army to go in there and get those people and the US didn't go in there and try to save those people
112.969000 120.427375 you know it's like you're not going to go in there and say no listen there's a separate country why because you're going into the border
120.427375 129.733750 right once you get into the border then there's a threat but what happens is you don't mess with us we won't mess with you but let's mess with the neutral countries
129.733750 140.834000 you know and now it's like you know they're saying other people were were i guess other leaders were still crazier about it you know like other people
140.834000 144.841500 you could think that they might use a bomb here and a bomb there
144.841500 149.828000 but Russia has never been known for throwing an atomic bomb anywhere
149.828000 152.003625 and the US has
152.003625 165.395125 you know it's like they it seems like they can their their army or whatever can can go in there quicker than an atomic bomb can and do do the job with uh you know less suffering
165.395125 168.484500 you know but i think i think the thing is is that
168.484500 177.191625 there the thing like they were saying they go you know like Libya could start a nuclear war because of whoever is behind the button
177.191625 181.510000 but not the USSR the USSR wouldn't do it
181.510000 183.758750 because they got too much at stake
183.758750 195.310875 [silence]
195.310875 196.678750 yeah
196.678750 197.680125 [silence]
197.680125 199.305875 well
199.305875 212.964500 my my point of view to that is is that it would have had so much i mean the attack would have been so complete on Iraq if they had i mean the first you can imagine the first uh chemical weapon used
212.964500 219.759375 that would have meant a total attack of the Iraq country within you know three hours of when the weapon was shot
219.759375 221.187750 [silence]
221.187750 231.013250 right and what happens is what happens is suppose they get Saddam Hussein which they eventually will he's got one less thing to go against him
231.013250 237.696125 i mean if he were to use that he might as well commit suicide because he's going to be captured and you know
237.696125 247.790500 but the US also makes a lot of uh you know treaties with other people like saying okay if you give up then you can come live in our country and we'll take care of you like Marcos right
247.790500 252.392625 we'll overthrow you but yet you can still come live here you know
252.392625 254.477875 [silence]
254.477875 256.133625 uh [laughter] no

281.595875 291.306875 you know like people will go like they like the U S goes and goes into Panama and what see i don't believe in war that's my thing i don't believe that anybody should die
291.306875 304.207500 you know and so then you know you have because what happens is suppose i'm i go to war and i'm holding a gun and i'm just looking at myself holding a gun and whoever shoots first survives you know
304.207500 313.344875 but that same person also has a family and you know his parents are going to cry and you know life ends there and to me that's ridiculous
313.344875 319.475625 you know i mean i just don't believe it i think there are other ways to fix it even though sometimes there aren't but
319.475625 326.985125 it's pretty hard to think that you know people are just going to shoot each other down and it's legal in a situation like that you know
326.985125 329.176625 [silence]
329.176625 330.538750 yeah
330.538750 333.359875 [silence]
333.359875 341.353625 yeah i mean i mean Saddam Hussein lost so much money during the war that it was ridiculous and he all he was trying to do was make money at the beginning so
341.353625 344.892000 and keep his power but well
344.892000 348.322500 [silence]
348.322500 358.825875 no i i don't think so i think uh they're getting they're especially getting their life back together now because a lot of things that you saw on TV a lot of uh inhabitants of Russia
358.825875 366.138750 would love to stay in their country just as long as they were able to express what they wanted to a lot of like dancers and stuff like that
366.138750 372.676500 they said that they wouldn't leave Russia unless Russia told them that they couldn't travel anymore and compete
372.676500 376.190125 so it must be a beautiful country it's just that you know
376.190125 380.491375 they won't let you get out and when you want to get out of the country that's what you want to do
380.491375 383.802375 so oh well i got to go to class now
383.802375 386.083375 nice talking to you bye-bye

0.000000 1.074875 [silence]
1.074875 3.849875 so what do you think about a year or two of public service
3.849875 10.577875 [silence]
10.577875 11.855625 uh-huh
11.855625 15.855750 [silence]
15.855750 17.544000 yes yeah

36.289250 37.683250 uh-huh
37.683250 45.456125 [silence]
45.456125 60.403125 you know i- i really agree with you um i uh though i've never done that myself i i'm was a basically an education major when i graduated from college and i accepted a job that at the time was just slightly above the poverty level to teach
60.403125 73.265250 to um very rural children in a very low income district and i spent a year teaching there and i think it was probably one of my largest eye opening experiences because i come from nice 
73.265250 77.837500 middle class white suburban home and i did it um
77.837500 92.032875 for one reason i wanted i was working on a masters degree so i wanted to stay close to where i was working on a masters degree but also because i just thought that it would be interesting to live someplace else so totally different than my own upbringing and i it changed
92.032875 97.653000 it probably changed my political views it changed my understanding of the world around me
97.653000 111.048375 and i think um in fact if if i had to do it all again i you know i- i after that you know you never think of it because i guess because i paid for all of my college education myself i never thought about
111.048375 115.292125 doing that because i had all these college loans i'd started paying back
115.292125 123.028750 um becau[se]- so that was that was one reason why i never considered it but now that i'm further along and i'm still paying these college loans 
123.028750 131.209875 i- i think realistically you know you can have your college loans delayed now because_1 i had them delayed because i'm back in graduate school at thirty years old
131.209875 138.616125 um i had them delayed because i'm back in graduate school and on that form it says if your joining the Peace Corps you can have them delayed
138.616125 147.457250 uh and i thought that was you know very interesting and i- i would have thought of that earlier i probably would have done you know just like is that is this is that the Mormon church
147.457250 159.811750 that does that um-hum because_1 one of my neighbors uh did that in Pittsburgh from Pittsburgh and i thought you know that really now that i'm thirty years old i think that one or two years out of my life would've probably like you said
159.811750 168.483250 to be able to travel someplace else whether it be the United States or outside the country i think would've been a very good um experience for me
168.483250 171.350250 [silence]
171.350250 172.383375 um-hum

195.871750 197.196000 yeah
197.196000 202.393000 and i think you know we have such a need now you know i taught you know i- i think i was paid
202.393000 214.732000 uh about nine thousand dollars to teach for the year and i worked in a very rural school district and i- i one of the things i taught was a computer class and these kids
214.732000 225.507625 um you know every girl i taught except for one was pregnant many of the boys in the room had children and they were they were high school juniors
225.507625 231.698500 and i and i just there you know they came from poverty they were going to continue in poverty
231.698500 242.292125 and it was it was the school district couldn't hire many people it was very difficult for them to hire and i think you know in the sense that aspect of public service for education in some of the inner cities
242.292125 250.770000 for um just social workers in some of the inner cities and some of the rural areas where they just need advice on medical um
250.770000 260.483375 things i think it's a really good idea and even if it is overseas see i never i- i tell you sometimes i worry about things overseas because we have such problems right here in our own country
260.483375 267.160625 um-hum
267.160625 268.380875 yeah

287.897625 289.278125 [silence]
289.278125 295.391000 yeah i think it would also help them_1 if they then went on to college i know that my first couple of years of college were um
295.391000 304.197125 uh probably too carefree at the beginning and then at the end i had to be too serious [vocalized-noise]

316.930875 321.018125 i yeah i think i think this was this was a very interesting topic
321.018125 326.423750 uh because it's something that you know we don't talk about in this country probably enough
326.423750 328.494125 uh you know
328.494125 330.796375 [silence]

348.402125 349.941375 oh i think it is

358.870125 366.361375 and um i find great disgust in them in their in their um [laughter] their self-centeredness
366.361375 380.691875 and their inability to understand um multicultural or multiracial situations and i really you know they don't understand uh how other people live um they don't understand

381.748125 383.522125 um-hum
383.522125 387.343125 yep i think that's uh j[ust]- just having a good time 
387.343125 397.496750 i uh a friend of mine is a psychologist and he always refers to it as uh short-term pleasure oriented i guess he's a technical aspect he likes to apply to it
397.496750 405.262375 you know today's young people are short-term pleasure oriented and everything has to be an immediate reward and it has to be fun
405.262375 407.365500 um-hum yeah 
407.365500 411.692375 [silence]
411.692375 420.924625 well they say i think i um have read recently that uh the Bush Administration has increased the funding for the Peace Corps
420.924625 424.798125 uh-huh because i guess because_1 of the changes in Eastern Europe
424.798125 439.746000 uh they've increased funding for the Peace Corps some of the i guess it's some of the peace dividend in the sense you known when they're decreasing some of the military spending some of that money has gone into the Peace Corps and some of the other overseas programs uh

487.156250 488.941875 area are lawyers
488.941875 493.923500 and and i- i just sort of think that's ridiculous yeah with
493.923500 505.308625 you know with the great needs that we need today in science and biology and uh you know the the problems we have with AIDS and cancer and and that how come everybody is a lawyer you know you know

0.000000 4.006875 [silence]
4.006875 18.915375 well i know it's hard for young people to think about giving up their years you know free their carefree years but people that i have known that have done that i like from other countries especially Germany and Finland 
18.915375 30.138000 they are just they have such a better more mature outlook on life and i think they're better people because of it they're much more responsible i know um
30.138000 43.352250 the church that i go to um the young men give two years of their life when they turn nineteen you know they're encouraged to do that missionary work and i be[lieve]- i really believe that the people that do that 
43.352250 47.625500 are better people and uh make our society better

166.265125 168.619375 [silence]
168.619375 175.521250 well i think so it puts you out on your own and and in a time after high school um
175.521250 179.050375 there's kind of a selfishness i mean teenagers in our country are kind of
179.050375 193.896250 kind of a year that parents don't look forward to and and things like that and i think that it would help people to become less self-centered and to be more responsible when you're out on your own trying to um
193.896250 198.245625 thinking less of your own needs but of other people
198.245625 206.042375 [silence]

261.879250 273.826125 it would really um and i don't [laughter] the people that i've known like from Germany and Finland that have done that are they do military service which you know i don't exactly recommend but still
273.826125 279.136000 they have benefited from it and um you know although i wouldn't want
279.136000 289.443625 m[ilitary]- mil[itary]- to make people to go off to the military voluntarily but it's it has helped them and they are just a lot more mature than the average student and

306.182375 315.940500 are so excited to be away from home they just spend all there time partying and they do a lot of things to themselves and that we don't really want our young people to be doing and

329.139250 332.772000 we love our freedom and our freedom of choice
332.772000 346.217875 and um having people but you know our like in our church it it is you're free to do that or not you're encouraged to do it because um you know it it helps you and
346.217875 350.099750 of course we think it's helping other people and so

410.993500 423.971375 so far there's only two of us that have gone and my older brother has paid his entire way and i'm on my i have six weeks left f[or]- and i'll you know i'll graduate and i paid my entire way and that's the way it'll go down the line and
423.971375 435.891750 like w[e]- i don't have a car because i'm paying for college and if i want a car my parents always said if we wanted a car we paid for the car and we paid for our own insurance and and i think that's right because

444.945750 446.308250 um-hum

447.776375 449.349375 [silence]
449.349375 459.335125 um-hum like i've had my you know like um like i know kids up here that have their own cars their money's just given to them_1 like they still get their allowance they're twenty years old and they still get an allowance
459.335125 463.615500 well i've held a summer job since i you know i was in the eleventh grade
463.615500 475.212875 and i have had to take care of my own money i have my own checking account i pay for my own life insurance and i know a lot of kids that don't even know wh[at]- i mean i tell them i pay for my own life insurance and their mouths just drop to the floor
475.212875 476.595625 you know
476.595625 480.913750 [laughter] well if they do they don't know of it you know [laughter]

520.546625 522.654000 [silence]
522.654000 528.947250 actually i think abortion's going to take a turn where there's not going to be as many
528.947250 537.084625 because i think contraceptives are going to be more popular i mean i realize that they are popular now but i think
537.084625 543.502375 i i r[eally]- i really think people are going to start using more contraceptives and with the abortion it
543.502375 553.984250 i i don't think there's going to be many abortions but i don't know what women will do when they get into politics you know about abortion
553.984250 557.101375 i think it'll be freedom of choice
557.101375 561.438375 [silence]
561.438375 562.538625 uh-huh
562.538625 564.987250 [silence]

568.242125 569.958875 [silence]
569.958875 571.384375 yeah
571.384375 578.825625 i think if a woman would get into politics or enough women get into politics i d[efinitely]- i think it'll definitely be freedom of choice
578.825625 580.755375 um-hum
580.755375 589.238500 i i do i'm Catholic and i we we're not supposed to you know say that that's okay but i really feel that it's freedom of choice
589.238500 590.348500 i do
590.348500 592.924875 [silence]
592.924875 594.627250 um-hum
594.627250 598.664250 and and different circumstances call for different things
598.664250 599.406000 [noise]


0.000000 0.407625 [noise]
0.407625 1.551000 [silence]

3.664125 21.686125 [silence]
21.686125 23.523125 yes definitely
23.523125 26.999500 [silence]
26.999500 35.506500 well i feel that uh i we've missed as far as the top jobs go you know the the higher echelon
35.506500 38.679375 because_1 if you look at most corporations there isn't a woman
38.679375 51.520625 you know that's on the board of directors or that type of thing they're mostly all men there there may be a few but very incidental [laughter] and uh i i really think that it'll be a long time probably before we see that
51.520625 62.607625 in one sense um i['m]- i'm an older person in my fifties so i feel that we've lost some things in the sense that women have to work today
62.607625 66.835000 you know that that they're not in the home by choice anymore
66.835000 70.700000 i[t's]- most of the ti[me]- you know e[ven]- even if you want to say home you c[an't]- you really can't
70.700000 72.311750 i[t's]- i[t's]- i[t's]-
72.311750 83.255375 y[ou]- you know it's it's gotten to be a two income family to just survive today between taxes and the cost of living and i don't think raises have kept up with you know a lot of the stuff
83.255375 90.663750 uh you know as far as your medical insurance and uh just groceries and gasoline and all this you know
90.663750 103.388750 so i think that we we did come a long way in the sense that we ha[ve]- we're allowed to vote in you know like you say we're out in the labor force but i think we've lost something too
103.388750 108.823125 [silence]
108.823125 110.369875 oh God love her
110.369875 116.169125 [silence]
116.169125 117.473125 yeah
117.473125 129.011250 [silence]
129.011250 139.619000 that's what i mean and and you know there's a lot of truth to that if you're not going to have a family then that's fine then y[ou]- you know a career is is a smart choice and i think it's great
139.619000 144.860000 but if you you have a family i think you owe the family a responsibility
144.860000 156.539250 and to have children and just get a daycare or someone to take care of it and not really have the bonding process that takes place with babies and stuff you know
156.539250 166.542000 uh i think that both the mother and the child lose and i think that's why there's so many problems you know with kids today because_1 they don't have the family roots anymore
166.542000 171.825750 you know i'm not saying that that it's totally gone but it's nothing like what it used to be
171.825750 173.602250 you know in that sense
173.602250 190.441375 [silence]
190.441375 191.803500 oh definitely
191.803500 198.229125 [silence]
198.229125 199.768125 that's right
199.768125 207.166500 they don't want to take care of the kids and the house and that kind of thing that's very true but then they shouldn't have a family
207.166500 211.200375 that's what i'm saying you know i i think it's great that women have a choice today
211.200375 222.348750 that there are ways to prevent families you know like those basically there's contraceptives and all kinds of ways to prevent pregnancies there's no need to have children if you don't want them
222.348750 232.702750 [silence]
232.702750 242.167125 that's fine that that's the freedom of choice and i i agree with that because anyone who has children that doesn't really want them isn't going to be a good parent
242.167125 249.753250 uh well i shouldn't say they're not going to be a good parent they won't be a caring parent like they won't have that uh
249.753250 253.940625 right tha[t's]- that's what i mean it they'll feel like it's uh a job
253.940625 256.870375 i[t's]- it's not like something that they really wanted
256.870375 261.200000 like i had three children and i mean i i i wanted every one of them
261.200000 267.518750 i'm not sorry i had any of them_1 and i worked third shift for a good part of my life just so i would be home with them
267.518750 272.330375 you know i had to work but i tried to make it as painless as possible
272.330375 284.848625 in fact at one time i worked as a second shift and uh uh one Saturday morning we were all sitting at the breakfast table and the kids were talking daddy this daddy that daddy this daddy that and i was sitting there it was like i didn't belong anymore
284.848625 288.081375 and it was because i had worked for about nine months
288.081375 291.314000 and when they were coming home i was going to work
291.314000 298.499000 and i wasn't there at supper time or bed time or they couldn't tell me what went on at school because they'd be coming in the door i'd be going out
298.499000 302.429125 so we were i i felt i was losing my family
302.429125 308.719500 and that's why i said that's it i either have to quit or you know try something else so i went on third shift
308.719500 311.034250 and i worked that shift for eleven years
311.034250 312.547250 yeah
312.547250 317.169000 yeah just so that my kids would would have me at home
317.169000 330.965875 you know and i feel that's very important it really is and it's too bad be[cause]- because mothers miss out on so much too so i mean in the sense that we've come a long way yes but we've sacrificed a lot to get there
330.965875 341.141625 and uh i really think that if uh like after second World War when women went to work in factories and all that that was like out of necessity because_1 the men weren't here anymore
341.141625 345.289875 but then it got to be a point where they got some independence
345.289875 347.192000 [silence]
347.192000 351.984375 exactly a man can afford the necessities a woman affords the luxuries
351.984375 358.493000 and i notice today's uh kids you know like we had apartments before we had homes
358.493000 361.739625 and we had to walk before we had a car
361.739625 366.880125 and now kids at sixteen years old they have their birthday what what do they get they get a car
366.880125 371.692125 and uh it to me it's like we've lost our values in this country
371.692125 378.000625 we really have and i i'm not trying to be uh you know a prude or old fashioned or anything but
378.000625 389.066000 i i don't think if you unless you earn something and you've worked for it and you have a sense of pride about it because while i did this in uh you know no one gave it to me
389.066000 396.901125 you'll take better care of that and you'll prize that possession more than someone handing something to you
396.901125 404.930250 and it's just like college too i think that if a kid goes to college and you can help them fine but i don't think you should pay the whole way
404.930250 409.034000 [silence]
409.034000 410.615750 of course
410.615750 419.421750 [silence]
419.421750 420.417250 yeah
420.417250 427.385750 [silence]
427.385750 428.421500 sure
428.421500 435.027750 [silence]
435.027750 438.724125 but i'll bet your values are a lot higher
438.724125 446.812500 you know y[our]- y[our]- and your self esteem and the w[ay]- the way you uh you know think about things is probably a lot more common sense
446.812500 450.524250 than these kids that don't have that responsibility
450.524250 458.602375 [silence]
458.602375 460.982500 you that that [vocalized-noise]
460.982500 462.428750 [silence]

464.636250 475.430625 [silence]
475.430625 477.814500 sure they probably don't even have any
477.814500 480.765500 or yeah exactly
480.765500 492.663750 and that's what i say y[ou]- you'll b[e]- you'll be so much better off for it as you get older because you know a lot of kids resent things that parents tell them and and stuff but it's because you've been there
492.663750 502.528375 and no one can tell anyone anything any[thing]- you know you're going to find out for yourself but i mean i don't think you should just not listen to advice even if you don't take it just listen
502.528375 507.752500 you know there's there's no harm in that whereas sometimes you can't even get that from a kid you know
507.752500 510.477125 [laughter] just attention you know
510.477125 518.084375 but really uh wh[at]- what do you feel the changes in the future like with the abortions and that type of thing
518.084375 520.155375 women in politics and
520.155375 523.856750 president someday maybe [laughter]

562.018750 570.756625 then i mean a[ll]- all of us are going to answer to it one day maybe or maybe not i don't know i mean no one's said for sure you know

18.123625 23.810875 i hadn't been thinking much about the Middle East and what's going on over there have you been keeping up

81.734125 95.431750 well i um when the when the crisis began last August i began to think well i i um couldn't remember things that i had studied in the past in school and all so i got out like my encyclopedias and
95.431750 103.884375 tried to read about the history and it was really what i felt was kind of cynical because it there just hasn't been any peace over there
103.884375 107.787875 ever in thousands of years of history
107.787875 109.175625 [silence]
109.175625 110.176000 yeah
110.176000 113.148000 that's right and it just it's just not people they
113.148000 119.204250 and it's not uh you know there isn't any real Arab coalition because they do fight among themselves
119.204250 122.789250 and they fight with each other and they have such hatred for
122.789250 125.259000 Israel and

159.768000 163.952125 and um with and that i'm afraid that we would have to stay

307.920125 321.165250 [noise] well i just uh i'm not interested in keeping big military over there and having to go in and call the shots like you say an[d]- and i just would prefer that i mean sometimes we've said let's keep we
321.165250 328.850750 we're not interested in what other countries do and then other times we jump in and do things and while i'm really glad that they
328.850750 336.412750 uh i it was important de[militarize]- demilitarize that area because of all the build up armaments
336.412750 341.380125 i don't ho[pe]- [laughter-i'd] i hope we don't try to keep uh
341.380125 343.313375 in there and try to
343.313375 345.757375 keep our fingers in the pot and try to
345.757375 349.852375 stay over there because we just don't want to send our people there and make them stay

8.557750 22.753750 [silence]
22.753750 28.376125 uh well [noise] uh just really the last couple of days since this uh the UN
28.376125 31.330125 debate or whatever you want to call it that uh
31.330125 34.891000 voted on whether there was going to be a cease fire i guess
34.891000 38.442875 you know the thing really isn't over they uh
38.442875 44.223625 they had uh kind of uh i don't know if you call it standout or whatever but anyway they stopped
44.223625 49.295000 and wait to see if Iraq would accept a permanent cease fire situation though
49.295000 55.001500 as i understand it from the Iraqi point of view this current cease fire thing that the UN uh
55.001500 62.260000 had set up you know the Iraqis are probably not going to go for at all unless they're just absolutely forced to
62.260000 65.614875 so i guess from what i understand the thing could just
65.614875 69.279375 they could take off at any moment without uh
69.279375 70.634125 you know any
70.634125 73.966875 uh-huh you know any local um
73.966875 78.251875 you know congressional effort or anything else because you know it's not really settled yet
78.251875 79.933625 [silence]
79.933625 82.449500 not yet not yet at all
82.449500 96.577000 [silence]

103.922625 105.828500 no
105.828500 109.507250 yeah i don't know why they expect it's going to start this week you know
109.507250 110.199750 [laughter]
110.199750 117.979250 [silence]
117.979250 119.423625 uh-huh
119.423625 124.622625 [silence]
124.622625 130.644625 yeah the uh the thing that's kind of interesting uh about this my sons in the Air Force
130.644625 138.934125 and uh he came within about a quarter of an inch of going uh to Saudi he ended up in Korea instead and because of the way they split a transportation group out in Lubbock
138.934125 142.502875 so he ended up going to Korea but his buddies ended up going to Saudi
142.502875 150.044750 well he's still in Korea and his buddies home now [laughter] he he almost wishes that that he could have gone home
150.044750 151.296750 [silence]
151.296750 152.347625 yeah
152.347625 158.996625 [silence]
158.996625 160.166250 uh-huh
160.166250 163.429875 [silence]
163.429875 164.546500 yeah
164.546500 171.288750 the thing uh the other thing too when this all started if you you know if you did much reading on the thing you know Kuwait
171.288750 175.124750 the country of Kuwait was just you know somebody's
175.124750 179.887875 uh you go back to World War i when the uh Ottoman empire broke up
179.887875 184.230750 and the British and the French and the Eng[lish]- yeah the British and the French mostly 
184.230750 195.388500 decided to carve up that part of the world and call part of it Persia and part of it uh Iraq and part of it something else you know and they they split things along um
195.388500 199.682125 geographical lines but they didn't take any kind of consideration into uh
199.682125 201.401625 social or cultural
201.401625 207.968000 things at all so the country of Kuwait really doesn't make just a whole lot of sense
207.968000 210.918500 except that it is an accepted
210.918500 214.874875 place you know it's like any other country you know for whatever reason it's
214.874875 220.499750 it's actually there well Iraq has had uh designs on that place since nineteen twenty two 
220.499750 224.018625 so you know it wasn't like something that just suddenly popped up
224.018625 226.743000 and it's just that this was an excuse
226.743000 235.208375 you know to make some noise now something that i read in the paper the other day that i thought was kind of interesting was that the Arab
235.208375 236.675250 uh
236.675250 250.259375 uh their version or vision or whatever the United States now is somewhat changed in that we won you know now now we are a uh a legitimate player in the game over there you know the
250.259375 256.492125 we i don't think we can really understand their attitude because their culture's just so much different
256.492125 260.891250 uh we are now a legitimate player in the
260.891250 265.745625 in the in the game because we came in with a certain amount of force and we
265.745625 267.518125 you know we defeated
267.518125 274.816750 you know Iran couldn't do it in seven years and we went in and did in seven days what Iran couldn't do in seven years you know so
274.816750 279.754875 that kind of ups our stock in there just a little bit it makes us more legitimate
279.754875 290.340750 so now what they're saying is that well since we won whatever we say goes because it's a kind of a might makes right attitude about it and you know we've got the power
290.340750 291.700625 yeah
291.700625 299.963250 which is why for centuries you know hundreds of years the British and the French had so much influence in there because they'd go in and they'd win something
299.963250 302.999500 and then and then they could call the shots for the next
302.999500 307.040250 you know period of time until the next strong man came up and you know and
307.040250 308.820500 and caused problems so
308.820500 315.314000 [silence]
315.314000 316.983500 yeah yeah
316.983500 323.470000 [silence]
323.470000 324.712125 uh-huh
324.712125 335.313250 [silence]

346.626500 349.001000 [silence]
349.001000 351.341125 yeah that's that's the uh
351.341125 355.068625 that's that's the big thing you know we still got a little bit of the old
355.068625 358.118875 you know Vietnam um
358.118875 364.701250 problem in you know in the back of our minds we we got this we're we're used to wars where you can get in do the job and get out
364.701250 369.825625 Vietnam we never did get out you know never did get the job done because they were too ham strung
369.825625 375.167875 uh this thing they they gave the guys uh the power and the material and the
375.167875 384.828625 told them to go do it and they did it you know got in and got out i'm not sure the the big fuss that we're going to see now for the next few weeks i would think
384.828625 396.921000 is uh you know the uh the business with the uh the Shiites of all people you know in the southern part of the country and also the Kurds because these people evidently are you know being killed off by the thousands
396.921000 406.037875 and whether the the United Nations i don't think the US will do it on their own but whether the United Nations comes around and says hey wait a minute we know this thing isn't
406.037875 413.515500 uh all that much over we've got to go back in there and and be sure that this large population isn't just wiped out
413.515500 417.199000 which is seems to be exactly what's happening right at the moment
417.199000 420.347875 but uh you know
420.347875 422.820625 [silence]
422.820625 433.363125 oh well no no there there never will be i mean uh uh the only way that you're going to have peace over there if if we determine that we want to go in and wipe out every last one of them
433.363125 438.965250 you know until we make a decision to do that there won't be peace but i don't think we want to make that decision either
438.965250 444.532375 so that's that's a little rough you know we're not we're not quite up to that sort of thing
444.532375 445.703750 so
445.703750 449.065875 [silence]
449.065875 450.021750 oh

384.447000 385.940750 [silence]
385.940750 388.018625 yeah i was in Peru
388.018625 390.486000 Peru but um
390.486000 404.415625 i there weren't as i recall or at least i wasn't aware of that many Americans there except for a very heavy concentration of Peace Corps volunteers this was when the Peace Corps first are started and it was one of the big targets
404.415625 410.607250 and um i don't i don't think at that time at least Peace Corps was
410.607250 412.462750 uh
412.462750 427.256000 an obnoxious group in the sense that that we were very controlled regarding number of days off and and you couldn't just take up take off and leave your group and go explore and and things like that
427.256000 436.994250 but and i was working actually in the savings and loan program so that was quite specialized although i was living in the slums i was really working with the middle class
436.994250 438.969250 [silence]
438.969250 441.508500 i was up in Arequipa
441.508500 442.568625 [silence]
442.568625 444.471250 and um
444.471250 446.299000 uh-huh
446.299000 447.467375 so
447.467375 451.078000 [silence]
451.078000 460.736625 i don't have any idea um probably not i mean there were thir[teen]- i was uh Per[u]- Peru thirteen which meant there were twelve groups before mine
460.736625 474.911375 that had gone in and and some of them were quite big in the sense they were community development and they were building schools and doing coops and things like that health um inoculation and and things 
474.911375 487.626875 [silence]
487.626875 496.940625 no no i believe they did because um some of some of the the Peace Corps uh that i knew of did marry Peruvians
496.940625 507.131125 and have been back and every now and then some news filters in that they went to see some of the old things and of course the savings and loan program um
507.131125 521.788125 that was that you know that that just continued to grow in fact after my group i mean we were just a very small specialized group too to get that going and spread and then of course Peace Corps bowed out of that because that's uh uh
521.788125 526.903125 something that nationalized very quickly and the same with the coops 
526.903125 531.650750 [silence]
531.650750 533.126875 right
533.126875 546.275375 [silence]
546.275375 547.667250 uh-huh
547.667250 555.824750 yeah i've you know some of the programs i would have concern about like um the language teaching you know i mean
555.824750 567.679500 why should we push English and a lot of people were down there teaching English and when they talked about Hungary or someplace one of the eastern law countries requesting Peace Corps to teach 
567.679500 581.393250 language you know to me that's a little bit marginal i did teach economics at the university one night a week and the textbook was in English but basically i taught it in Spanish because i mean
581.393250 586.800375 i really didn't see the point in their knowing stuff rotely and writing it on a test 
586.800375 599.837875 [silence]


0.000000 1.050250 [noise]
1.050250 3.637000 good morning
3.637000 17.205000 uh okay go ahead yeah i understand the topic this morning is uh our policy in Latin America and you know what we've been doing down there so i don't know
17.205000 27.089750 as you indicated you don't have too much input into the area it it just so happens that uh our daughter-in-law is Panamanian
27.089750 32.608750 and uh we have been in Panama and i have worked in El Salvador and
32.608750 41.119250 we visit Mexico occasionally so [laughter] yeah we we do have a little information on it here but uh
41.119250 47.247750 [silence]
47.247750 48.794250 oh uh-huh
48.794250 52.296750 [silence]
52.296750 53.889875 yeah
53.889875 59.252875 it does seem to have quieted down there just a little bit that's that's for sure
59.252875 71.057625 no i the US policy uh towards Central America as far as uh well i kind of go back to to the El Salvador thing because Texas Instruments had a
71.057625 82.843500 a plant down there for a while and i worked in there for a little while and at that particular time let's let's see that was seventy three seventy four kind of before the the uh the
82.843500 97.703500 the uh Civil War really picked up down there and US policy at that particular time there was of course military assistance to uh to the government itself you know anything that's
97.703500 110.633625 that's {anticommunist} you know we kind of had a tendency to be pro [laughter] it don't matter what their excesses were and i believe at the time that i was down there 
110.633625 123.435875 that uh the government uh the Salvadorian government you know really gotten out of hand yet the uh right wing death squad type situation i believe that that was beginning to form but i don't
123.435875 136.594125 i i wasn't really aware of it's being you know terribly uh you know rapid at the time that that i was down there i think that really kind of developed a little bit later on 
136.594125 143.146375 but uh our policies seem to be pretty much one of uh you know trying to setup businesses
143.146375 155.433250 down there and use the one resource anyway that Salvador had [noise] plenty of and that was people we didn't seem to be going in and taking anything out of the country other than just it's it's labor
155.433250 166.095000 because everything that TI did anyway we we shipped in and it was worked on down there assembled and then sent back here so i didn't feel that we really ex[ploiting]- exploiting them any
166.095000 174.210625 [silence]
174.210625 183.951375 no uh in the particular incidence that i was aware of now TI wasn't the only ones in there Playtex was in there was uh several other companies and uh
183.951375 197.337750 of course we kind of concentrate on there wasn't much to take out of the country i felt like we're going in and taken all their um their gold or oil or bananas or coffee or anything like that because uh it just
197.337750 203.248750 the only thing that they had a great abundance of was uh you know human beings [laughter]
203.248750 218.516250 [silence]
218.516250 219.846750 [vocalized-noise]
219.846750 223.623875 yeah i understand what you say there was a uh [noise]
223.623875 236.350750 the time that i was down there i stayed quite a a bit at the uh uh one of the big hotels San Salvador and at the time i thought there ought to be a law against American tourists
236.350750 241.614250 because they for the most part tend to be the most obnoxious
241.614250 251.374625 as a as a group and i saw this in Panama so uh oh you know it's it's the uh the almost stereotype
251.374625 262.511125 you know flowery shirt shorts camera hanging around their neck you know demanding this that and the other thing you know we're we're here and we want this and we want that and that sort of thing that's
262.511125 266.863125 that's the stereotype that's very strong down there you know that uh
266.863125 270.028625 the you know that sort of thing
270.028625 275.269000 i i i believe those of us who were working down there got a little bit more appreciation for
275.269000 277.465000 you know the local
277.465000 282.394250 uh culture i really don't believe that we were
282.394250 288.922375 quite that bad but yet they were having to deal directly with uh you know with the uh the local people
288.922375 290.260750 and uh
290.260750 298.280000 but boy there is a there is a bad uh uh you know the old brash or ugly American type 
298.280000 308.569875 situation and i saw incidences in the hotel where i just wanted to go over and crawl in the corner and say oh my God those are those are not Americans [laughter] they can't be but they are
308.569875 319.750625 and uh of course now i i do have to i remember one case where we had some Canadians in there who were every bit as bad but i mean it i think it's just kind of the North American
319.750625 325.482875 situation uh in Panama they've been used to Americans down there for so darn long
325.482875 339.618500 but i didn't see quite as much of that sort of thing as Panamanians are just about as [laughter] as uh as as Americans as far as uh creature comforts you know they're uh they're they're every bit uh
339.618500 351.337500 i i know when my my son was in the Air Force and he was stationed in Panama and he married a Panamanian girl and when she came up here uh you know she's
351.337500 360.552000 y[ou]- kn[ow]- except for the language situation some of the cultures she's just about an American you know is as far as TV and
360.552000 375.519375 and you know the the moneymaking part of it and all that matter of fact if anything she's worse [laughter] but uh uh it it just there's little enclaves down there where you know Americans have a lot of influence
375.519375 378.065875 and the local population kind of
378.065875 379.309875 [silence]
379.309875 383.688500 um you know sort of accepts that but i've also seen the other side of it too
383.688500 384.758250 [silence]
384.758250 386.499500 well you were in Peru

536.775875 558.651500 i had wondered sometimes i knew that there was a lot of a lot of effort and a lot of work went into a lot of that and i just wondered if if it lasted and if it took you know like
558.651500 559.559875 uh-huh

252.147500 260.452250 [silence]
260.452250 264.499750 well here in Colorado it's even worse because_1 we have uh no fault

276.761375 278.886375 everyone pays all the time

579.987250 581.066000 [silence]

3.402875 6.431000 well i've uh
6.431000 20.233500 for a lot of years i i've pretty much flied without one and uh just recently uh we we set up a budget and and we're trying to stick to it we just bought a new house so we've got everything you know pretty much we know what our uh
20.233500 32.617000 our fixed expenses are per month and then we've got some ones that are variable that that pretty much stay within a certain range and then uh then there's the ones that you never know anything about and that's the the food budget
32.617000 33.673000 but that
33.673000 38.386375 [silence]
38.386375 41.374250 yeah well the utilities they're pretty much uh
41.374250 49.873375 uh you can pretty much uh figure what they're going to be and one of the nice things here is the electric company has a plan where they'll average them out for you
49.873375 55.873750 [silence]
55.873750 56.866875 um-hum

62.777500 67.160000 [silence]
67.160000 77.747625 well i used to um i used to know uh fairly close to exactly how many miles i drove because i- i was very convenient i lived uh
77.747625 80.165125 uh nine tenths of a mile from work
80.165125 91.845750 so so it was you know two miles a day [laughter] to and from work [laughter] so it kind of cut my transportation costs a lot but now i've just bought a new house and i'm a half hour
91.845750 97.707750 and so my uh transportation costs have gone up by uh five times [laughter]
97.707750 113.016375 [silence]
113.016375 118.521625 yeah pretty much um the problem is there never seems to be enough money
118.521625 128.840500 uh i have three children and it seems like the more money you make the more money you have the more things that they seem to need
128.840500 138.881375 and uh of course nothing ever goes down i mean uh i remember you know i have five children total i have three left in the house
138.881375 154.936875 and i can remember years ago when uh school would start and i'd go buy all five kids you know shoes and i could get out of the out of the uh shoe store without spending more than thirty five dollars nowadays thirty five dollars buys about one pair of shoes 
154.936875 163.083000 [laughter-yeah] so i mean things have just really gone out of sight in the last uh i guess about the last ten years
163.083000 164.829250 i'm exempt
164.829250 166.329250 [silence]

208.421125 209.942250 um
209.942250 219.444125 i've got uh two older cars there both one's a seventy seven and one's a seventy eight 
219.444125 223.230875 and uh my insurance is about uh
223.230875 229.460125 it was running about four hundred dollars a year but when i moved to the new town i live in because it's a different county
229.460125 240.206125 which has less crime and uh less you know less highways and so it's a cheaper place to live as far as the insurance company's concerned so my my
240.206125 243.907000 i think my insurance dropped about uh sixty dollars a year
243.907000 246.853250 [silence]
246.853250 250.297250 well it's actually three hundred and forty for each one of the cars so [noise]

283.251875 291.235000 it's kind of it's kind of strange here the way things go uh here if you have an accident and no one's injured the police won't even show up
291.235000 292.779625 nope
292.779625 297.570750 they tell you if nobody's injured you all exchange names and take it up with your insurance company

124.308500 125.585000 [silence]
125.585000 128.179000 it's better to [vocalized-noise] to be employed

132.119750 134.242375 [silence]

107.421875 117.601250 uh probably Spring but uh i don't much care about things like that i'll i'll make a little sort of greenhouse a miniature greenhouse to put all this stuff in
117.601250 120.802000 something something to keep me occupied you see
120.802000 125.319750 i'll uh buy some plastic and make a little house and
125.319750 129.098000 yeah and watch the cats tear it up
129.098000 133.500875 [silence]
133.500875 136.690250 they they just like to get in and dig
136.690250 138.734500 [silence]
138.734500 148.263125 oh they love to dig i had i had some uh i don't know what kind they are i've already forgotten just regular old flower seeds
148.263125 159.869875 and i planted them and i was so i was so thrilled because they came up i mean nice green shoots coming up all over the place and then my cats got into it and started digging and that took care of that
159.869875 165.966125 so i have to hang these things high so they can't get to them especially the catnip
165.966125 167.495625 [silence]
167.495625 168.763125 three

221.803125 223.658875 um
223.658875 231.697250 yeah an and if somebody raises a stink about it you can always go before the association and argue your case anyway
231.697250 236.852375 you know you don't have to put up with all these wild critters coming into your property
236.852375 241.588125 [silence]
241.588125 246.677750 yeah right here Bambi [laughter]
246.677750 248.608500 uh gosh
248.608500 256.279000 well let's see other than gardening which i fiddle at i'm not very good at what else do i mostly just computer stuff
256.279000 269.909250 i just like playing with my computer and doing stuff on that uh cooking that's not really a hobby it's a necessity but but i enjoy it i like to think that i'm a very good cook
269.909250 273.083375 [silence]
273.083375 277.766250 hobbies that's about it i don't have much time for hobbies so uh
277.766250 283.594875 between being a student and trying to run a business on the side you don't have a lot of time
283.594875 287.881250 yeah and raising cats
287.881250 289.654875 [silence]
289.654875 299.693000 well it's it started out as a hobby actually uh it just it developed into sort of a business uh you know we breed them and all that
299.693000 308.539750 but we didn't you know we didn't really start it for the money it was just they were fun to have around and we figured if we're going to have them we might as well have some purebreds and
308.539750 309.755375 [silence]
309.755375 318.185000 and now it developed in to going to cat shows and finding studs for them and you know all this kind of stuff
318.185000 324.344125 uh i've got a uh a Bombay a Turkish Van and a Himalayan Persian
324.344125 330.899500 yeah the {himmy} is probably the sweetest one she's she's just a little sweetheart 
330.899500 344.765125 we uh the the Bombay had a litter uh last October and i just got her back from the vet this morning getting her spayed only going to breed them once
344.765125 349.063125 and uh she's not she's not feeling too great today
349.063125 351.391000 [silence]
351.391000 358.964750 no uh m[ost]- most breeders are in it for the money so they'll bree[d]- they'll breed them twice a year
358.964750 369.132500 and i i just think that it's kind of i don't know it's kind of cruel you know they just they just breed these they breed them before they're ready uh and
369.132500 375.973375 you're never you're never real and and they they do a lot of inbreeding too and so you end up with you know kind of strange kittens
375.973375 378.039750 and i just don't like that
378.039750 380.088375 [silence]
380.088375 382.962125 we're we sold all that litter
382.962125 384.197125 um
384.197125 387.744875 we there's not that much call to for Bombay's 
387.744875 388.789875 um
388.789875 393.810250 they're they're registered but they're not they're not uh they're not show cats
393.810250 397.161375 uh so all you can do is sell them as pet quality
397.161375 408.609125 uh so what you've got is a registered pet and not too many people want Bombay's they want things like {himmy} Persians and Turkish Vans 
408.609125 419.776000 Turkish Vans if you've never seen one i mean you wouldn't know that it was a pure bred it's just uh medium size short hair cat it's got he's mostly white with uh brown and black patches 
419.776000 425.328000 but they have nice personalities and they're very inquisitive
425.328000 439.337375 um now the {himmy} we'll probably breed her a couple of times and we'll we'll end up keeping one out of each litter and then breeding those 
439.337375 447.321125 it's just the stud fees are so much though it'll cost about three hundred dollars for a stud for her we we want to breed her with a champion so
447.321125 448.664250 [silence]
448.664250 450.631625 yeah the Persian is
450.631625 453.094375 and the other two are short hairs
453.094375 454.761625 [silence]
454.761625 460.551625 yeah she's uh she's sweet going to have some nice kittens i hope 
460.551625 475.352250 she's uh she's if you if you know what a Himalayan is generally they look something like uh well they come in a lot of different colors people don't realize it but they're sort of like uh Siamese in a way they have the uh they have the uh 
475.352250 483.474500 they have the gloves on the paws and they're they're usually two colored uh but this one is uh
483.474500 495.892625 is she's pre[dominantly]- predominantly uh black but she has chocolate uh paws chocolate stomach and silver on her hindquarters
495.892625 499.880375 and yeah she's she's quite attractive looking
499.880375 504.170625 hope hope the stud will find her attractive
504.170625 518.656250 and and that she has a whole bunch of kittens but we have to be careful uh you know we have to get a particular color point uh stud you can't just breed them with anything we have to get a uh we have to get a silver point {himmy} 
518.656250 522.780875 so that the silver will be predominate in the kittens
522.780875 532.737500 that's it that's the fun part trying to figure out what you've got to breed them with can't just go out there and say okay you guys breed you know [laughter]
532.737500 535.204375 that's right
535.204375 541.179375 [silence]
541.179375 553.702000 well actually i mean it it is a business in a way but it it's a lot of fun as a hobby especially when you go to shows and get to see all the different cats we're we're about to get another breed we're go[ing]- we're going to buy a Devon Rex
553.702000 565.940375 and i didn't i don't like Devon Rexes at first it's a well actually it's a mutant it it comes from England and uh fr[om]- in the county of Devon
565.940375 578.972000 and it's a mutant cat and they're they're pretty expensive we're going to we're going to shell out probably about a thousand bucks for one um they're
578.972000 590.391250 very thin they're they're they're long and lanky and skinny and they have real short hair it's curly as a matter of fact
590.391250 598.602000 um yeah it it it's a strange looking cat uh i didn't like them at first they've got great big ears


0.000000 2.024375 [silence]
2.024375 8.134125 well i like gardening a lot i like to be outside um

48.192250 55.252500 no i i haven't had had good luck with that company uh i think some of it depends how long things stay in the mail probably
55.252500 62.942125 but i've had to to get my money back from them and had better luck with with some of the the more expensive companies
62.942125 63.980000 because_1 they

91.725875 99.456625 which at least if they if they take off the first year they're probably going to come up unless there's uh a terrible freeze or something

171.135625 176.575875 actually i just put a uh little fence around my yard uh um
176.575875 191.326500 which is i suppose technically illegal but i had so many groundhogs last year that i think they'll let me get by with it and it it's got this one inch mesh and what i've noticed it's kept the cats out and i love it [laughter]
191.326500 196.324250 [silence]
196.324250 205.579875 well because we have these tow[n]- uh i live in a townhouse and anyway all of our areas have associations that you have to get permission
205.579875 210.098125 and you know they want uh privacy fences
210.098125 211.311375 [silence]
211.311375 215.728000 right right well they do walking tours too so
215.728000 225.403000 but at least because i back up to um a hillside where the uh wild animals are i think i can probably justify it

0.000000 0.313375 [silence]
0.313375 6.085000 okay well uh how do you feel about uh drug testing
6.085000 33.529750 [silence]
33.529750 34.741625 yeah
34.741625 43.575500 [silence]
43.575500 48.225000 yeah i am too a little bit i mean i- i don't
48.225000 60.500250 want to be around people who are really on drugs and that sort of thing and and you know obviously they're probably not going to be doing a good job and so forth but i don't really like having to do it
60.500250 68.981750 it and i don't like the idea of it it's it's makes too much of a big brother type of thing
68.981750 88.268875 [silence]
88.268875 89.358000 yeah
89.358000 92.032000 [silence]
92.032000 93.229250 hum-um
93.229250 109.674250 [silence]
109.674250 117.571375 yeah yeah i think so too but you know it's one of those things
117.571375 136.009750 [silence]
136.009750 138.077500 yeah
138.077500 142.969250 [silence]
142.969250 156.119125 plus i guess if they are in trouble enough to be jailed or something of that nature for any length of time then the company has lost what they've put into that employee and their expertise or whatever
156.119125 163.034000 [silence]
163.034000 164.047375 yeah
164.047375 166.496000 [silence]
166.496000 176.483625 well do you think that um it should be like we have this sort of random spot testing type of thing or
176.483625 185.311750 do you think it would be more palatable if we had some sort of regular schedule or would that just allow everybody a chance to get out of it
185.311750 194.369750 [silence]
194.369750 197.790625 well you know if if they have time enough they can
197.790625 199.493500 stay off of it
199.493500 210.437125 [silence]
210.437125 211.964125 yeah
211.964125 243.640875 [silence]
243.640875 245.233125 yeah
245.233125 255.911875 [silence]
255.911875 269.518250 i think so too uh i know the the group i was in at the time this all came up they uh were quite vocal about it uh through electronic mail boy they just really
269.518250 284.026875 you know [laughter] let them_1 have it from one end to the other vehemently but uh it has quieted down but i don't think they probably feel any differently and some some of them_1 did quit the company
284.026875 304.043625 [silence]
304.043625 305.511500 true
305.511500 319.087125 [silence]
319.087125 320.599375 um-hum
320.599375 327.682875 yeah i wouldn't like anything of that [laughter-nature] you know don't tell me what to do [laughter-you] [laughter-know] 
327.682875 341.624375 [silence]
341.624375 342.817250 yeah
342.817250 366.883125 [silence]
366.883125 377.582000 yeah well i guess too if i thought that this would help really and truly do away with the drug problem
377.582000 383.193125 then that would be one thing but i think it's too minor and too
383.193125 390.130375 you know in in the whole scope of things this isn't going to to have any real affect on what's going on on the street
390.130375 408.391875 [silence]
408.391875 410.295875 yeah
410.295875 435.790375 [silence]
435.790375 450.258000 well yes that yes i- i think that could be a big problem you know i would just be irate if they said it was [laughter-positive] [laughter-and] i knew it wasn't you know that just really rub me the wrong way 
450.258000 472.587500 [silence]
472.587500 474.181375 yeah
474.181375 475.420000 yeah
475.420000 477.720875 [silence]
477.720875 479.302250 right
479.302250 482.078875 [silence]
482.078875 483.390500 no
483.390500 485.124000 [silence]
485.124000 498.342250 i guess the one that really got me too was that uh let's say your spouse is on a particular drug and you know what that is and then you end up with the same problem and you take their leftover medicine that's not allowed
498.342250 501.322125 [laughter-you] know that's that's totally [laughter-out] 
501.322125 523.959000 [silence]
523.959000 525.743250 uh-huh
525.743250 530.277125 [silence]
530.277125 532.297625 oh that's interesting
532.297625 535.598125 well
535.598125 538.705125 well i guess we've exhausted that one [laughter]
538.705125 541.790250 enjoyed talking to you good-bye 
541.790250 544.375875 [noise]


0.000000 5.403125 [silence]
5.403125 12.618750 um personally i don't have a problem with it uh i think uh
12.618750 18.579625 as far as uh protecting fellow employees protecting their reputation of the company
18.579625 31.641875 and the quality of work that the people do um it's justified on the other hand um i do agree that it's it's a it's an invasion of privacy as far as a person's
31.641875 46.309500 involvement outside of work um i would never i would never have a problem with anyone testing me but i can understand why people would object so i guess uh i guess uh i'm kind of mixed on it still at this point
46.309500 52.795875 [silence]
52.795875 54.260500 um-hum
54.260500 59.684375 [silence]
59.684375 61.274750 that's right
61.274750 67.944750 [silence]
67.944750 81.870375 that's absolutely right it it uh i guess it all comes down to uh you know a a definition of uh how much out outside activities affect your work and uh
81.870375 94.705250 uh granted you know any any kind of drug use on on company property and whatnot is is definitely not acceptable uh uh i don't think anybody would ever argue that or uh
94.705250 100.789625 any any after affects carrying over into the workday but um
100.789625 111.410625 you know i- i don't i'm not particularly concerned with what people do um after they leave for the day especially if i don't if i don't uh see any results of it the next day
111.410625 116.570125 [silence]
116.570125 124.976250 well it it is it you know on the other hand you you've got uh you've got the uh the possibility of people
124.976250 134.732375 oh you've got some people could be arrested for uh drug use drug dealings and things like that and uh if their if their employers
134.732375 144.773750 name hits the papers and that it's it's it's a mark against them the company and uh you know what kind of people work there what uh
144.773750 153.028750 [silence]
153.028750 155.240750 that's right that's right
155.240750 159.353125 right e[ven]- even if it is you know a company policy of uh 
159.353125 163.243500 immediate termination or whatever they still have to replace them
163.243500 166.908375 and uh there's there's a lot involved there
166.908375 184.037750 [silence]
184.037750 188.625625 i think i think the regular schedule stuff
188.625625 195.774375 um that when you say everybody get out of it that's a good point i never really thought of it that way
195.774375 207.139000 yeah they really can um i think the big the biggest problem i've got is is forcing it on someone after they've already
207.139000 219.326250 agreed to the terms of employment um as far as the new hires i- i hired on just early enough that i- i missed it um where the new hires were concerned but uh
219.326250 233.923875 not nobody no i don't think anybody questions that um testing someone as a as a as a pre condition to being hired but um for the conditions of employment to change while you're on the job that's 
233.923875 245.634125 i- i don't know that that's where i think that most people get upset it's uh yeah it it's changing the rules in the middle of the game basically and uh
245.634125 256.505125 it's just it it's a really tough question and it you know it people have have really quieted down after everything started but i still think there's a lot of there's a lot of resentment
256.505125 268.091000 [silence]
268.091000 269.589875 uh-huh
269.589875 272.626375 [silence]
272.626375 274.011000 you bet
274.011000 280.550000 [silence]
280.550000 282.665625 no that's right
282.665625 296.836375 yeah i- i know of some people who did uh it was it was indirectly related you know they could always come up with other reasons but it it had a lot to do with it just uh the the whole attitude because_1 it's really uh
296.836375 306.745375 it's just really it it seems so {unTI} you know with the the whole relaxed atmosphere that we have um to all of a sudden 
306.745375 320.654500 uh start forcing attitudes and whatnot you know there's not a lot of pressure to to vote the right way or anything else around TI like there like there is in some companies or at least you know from what i've heard but uh
320.654500 329.425500 yeah [laughter] um-hum no ab[solutely]- absolutely not you know it's it's it's if 
329.425500 342.938500 you know if you hired me i'll be you know supposedly you agreed with a majority of my views and my qualifications to begin with so uh you know let's let's stick with that original trust i guess huh
342.938500 353.617125 but uh it's it's still it it still remains a tough question and it's there's a lot of you know the whole the whole department of defense uh
353.617125 367.915375 reasoning behind the original plan and whatnot there's a lot of different things that uh come into play but that was i think everybody everybody pretty much knows that that was kind of a smoke screen to implement it throughout the whole company
367.915375 379.289750 [silence]
379.289750 380.756250 um-hum
380.756250 387.761500 [silence]
387.761500 398.716500 i really don't think so yeah i really don't because some people are going to are are going to risk it um it may prevent
398.716500 400.047750 [silence]
400.047750 405.941875 [laughter] i- i guess i guess what i'm trying to get at is if it if it if it does help
405.941875 417.257125 a few individuals maybe maybe it's worth it um you know it may prevent somebody who was was teetering on the edge of experimenting or whatnot but uh
417.257125 427.222750 i don't know if you know the it's it's a needs of the few and the needs of the many type situation i don't know if everybody should have to sacrifice quite as much
427.222750 431.615875 there there's still a big question in my mind that the the absolute
431.615875 438.876375 refusal to accept the possibility of of mistakes on the testing is something that still bothers me it it's
438.876375 446.850000 [silence]
446.850000 448.923875 um-hum
448.923875 459.576000 um-hum absolutely and that i- i don't know if uh i don't know if everybody understands all the implications on that too e[ven]- even if you 
459.576000 470.477500 you know if you take uh a a drug that was presc[ribed]- prescribed for you but the the prescription has run out you still had some left and you happen to take an extra 
470.477500 482.241250 penicillin well penicillin's not on the list but you know yeah i- i think you understand what i'm getting at it it can still show up and it can still flag as a positive and and those kinds of things obviously that's not the intent
482.241250 485.634250 and uh those are the kinds of things that still can show up
485.634250 491.492250 [silence]
491.492250 493.310375 um-hum
493.310375 497.591250 [silence]
497.591250 499.000875 that's right
499.000875 500.053750 [silence]
500.053750 505.746125 that's right i even had friends when i was going to college who were in uh
505.746125 520.249750 who are in pharmacy school and they could legally um provide medicine to their family mens fa[mily]- family members and friends certain medicines were were legal now i- i- i believe 
520.249750 533.907125 you know any of the any of the ones we would we would be tested for wouldn't be on those lists but uh um there were certain things that they could provide without a doctors prescription based on their qualifications and that can happen but uh

65.976250 67.203250 [silence]
67.203250 73.734500 yeah we're not too far [noise] behind i graduated in seventy one so i'm i'm same generation
73.734500 85.042125 i i'm it's going to be a short conversation because i agree with you i i think uh [noise] i don't i don't even think it ought to be uh voluntary i think it ought to be mandatory
85.042125 98.208500 uh for kids to either either do military service or public service one of the two uh a lot of reasons for that not not just because i'm a i'm a hard ass or anything it's just that
98.208500 103.397500 like you say kids are getting out of high school not knowing what in the heck they're going to do
103.397500 110.284375 and either the military or public service organization can give them a lot of focus
110.284375 123.669375 and i think that it might stop us some problems later on i mean you know y[ou]- these kids will get their their heads on straight and and figure out what they want to do instead of hanging around street corners selling drugs or something
123.669375 127.565750 uh it's i think it would be good for them uh
127.565750 133.662500 it helps mature them a little bit and helps them understand the world the way it really is
133.662500 140.423875 [silence]
140.423875 141.583250 oh yeah
141.583250 143.472375 [silence]

206.601000 207.873625 yeah
207.873625 215.962125 [silence]
215.962125 217.275000 yeah
217.275000 225.552500 and and most of them aren't i mean you look you look at the number of marriages that are occurring right ou[t]- i mean even in high school
225.552500 230.785500 and you know y[ou]- you wonder where are the parents in all of this
230.785500 235.793625 you know why isn't somebody stepping in and and sto[p]- putting a stop to this
235.793625 239.073750 kids in high school are just too young to be married
239.073750 243.877750 they ha[ve]- they have no idea what the world is like they don't how tough it is out there to make a living
243.877750 251.896125 uh i mean i was in the same boat when i left high school i my parents wanted me to go straight to college and i didn't
251.896125 256.508000 you know i was ready i was ready i had wanderlust i wanted to get out and see some things
256.508000 261.483750 so i joined the Air Force and ended up staying there for thirteen years
261.483750 271.739000 um but i had lived in my own little bubble up until that time and and after traveling around the world a few times i realized that things ain't the way they seem
271.739000 274.748125 and i i did a lot of growing up there uh
274.748125 280.960000 [silence]
280.960000 281.769250 uh-huh
281.769250 283.420625 [silence]
283.420625 284.580875 yeah
284.580875 286.226000 that's right
286.226000 288.556250 [silence]
288.556250 289.933500 that's right
289.933500 291.309875 [silence]
291.309875 292.306500 uh-huh
292.306500 293.898875 [silence]
293.898875 303.543125 well you know it's just like you say there's so much stuff that needs to be done here in this country and uh you know if if you could have a thought of something like uh
303.543125 312.976000 like a uh uh a Peace Corps sort of organization i mean this would be so useful just in uh for instance just helping old folks
312.976000 324.519625 you know they you know they need help they don't have anybody to depend on and it would be nice to have somebody come over and cut their yard or paint their house or do minor repairs or something like that
324.519625 325.836750 and
325.836750 334.028500 [silence]
334.028500 335.330250 yeah
335.330250 347.828125 [silence]
347.828125 349.578000 uh
349.578000 351.499500 yeah
351.499500 358.063625 [silence]
358.063625 359.486750 yeah
359.486750 367.959375 yeah my mom's in the same position late sixties and and it got to the got to the point where i mean me and my brother both were were gone
367.959375 377.444875 and she couldn't maintain the house without large expenditures of money you know it finally got to a point where she just had to sell it and move into an apartment
377.444875 379.427250 and uh
379.427250 387.914500 i i'm not i'm not saying that that wouldn't have happened anyway but it would have been nice if there had been somebody to come around and take care of the little things
387.914500 392.480500 you know like the like the yard work and little repairs and
392.480500 394.949750 painting and stuff like that
394.949750 400.776250 [silence]
400.776250 401.960000 oh yeah
401.960000 402.876000 sure
402.876000 405.006625 [silence]
405.006625 410.506500 sure i mean i mean the kids who would be giving the service are going to get a lot more out of it than just money
410.506500 419.235750 you know that i i remember when i was a kid i used to do little little things for the old folks around the neighborhood and uh i know how it made me feel
419.235750 421.603250 you know you s[o]-
421.603250 427.335750 uh peo[ple]- people just don't help people anymore they're they're out for themselves 
427.335750 440.499750 [silence]
440.499750 441.658000 yeah
441.658000 448.203000 well that's that's the that's the point we've gotten to you know every time somebody wants something they always turn to the government
448.203000 460.473375 and y[ou]- the government's going to be limited i where are they going to get the money they're going to get it from us and we can do it a lot more efficiently than the government we don't need to add fourteen layers of bureaucracy to a program
460.473375 461.607250 [silence]
461.607250 471.214000 um the thing that Carter works on uh Habitat For Humanity i was involved in that w[as]- uh in Montgomery before i came up to North Carolina 
471.214000 482.977000 and uh it was it was a pretty neat little program we'd just go out and they would buy a plot of land and contractors and builders and everybody else would donate their their time
482.977000 490.017125 and uh the materials were at cost and we'd put up houses and that was kind that was kind of neat
490.017125 495.074375 i uh in a way i think it's a little bit inefficient but but it's better than nothing
495.074375 500.750375 and and at least i had the opportunity of seeing two families move into decent housing
500.750375 513.048625 um course on the other hand i can start complaining very loudly about people on public assistance who are quite capable of doing something for themselves but just won't
513.048625 521.035125 because it's far more advantageous for them to sit there and just draw uh welfare money than it is to work
521.035125 525.620000 uh we did a uh a cost comparison in one of my courses
525.620000 539.123500 and we took all the benefits that a family that a a married couple with two kids would get under welfare and what they would be making at minimum wage and they came out four thousand dollars better a year by taking welfare
539.123500 541.993500 so there's no incentive for them to do anything
541.993500 545.796375 far better for them to sit on their butts and draw the money
545.796375 553.191875 [silence]
553.191875 555.144750 you had to do something
555.144750 560.859000 yeah a[nd]- an[d]- and that's been tried that was tried in Alabama too and it got shot down
560.859000 569.380250 i d[on't]- and i don't understand the reasoning for it i really don't it it seems perfectly logical that if somebody's going to take public money
569.380250 576.649125 then they should return something to the public i mean if nothing else go out along an interstate and pick up garbage
576.649125 578.118625 [silence]
578.118625 583.594375 yeah what do they what do they do in Maryland do they use highway people or do they use prisoners
583.594375 585.314750 [silence]
585.314750 588.384000 yeah tha[t]- that's the way they did it in Alabama too
588.384000 593.362000 u[sually]- usually you'd see these big chain gangs out there [laughter] picking up trash
593.362000 596.540625 [silence]
596.540625 599.566000 uh-huh uh-huh yeah we have that here in North Carolina


0.000000 2.406250 [silence]
2.406250 13.001875 i think it's uh a good idea um i grew up uh my teenage years were spent during the sixties graduating uh high school in sixty eight 
13.001875 24.358625 um i remember when the Peace Corps movement first came about and i thought it was a very good idea at the time i was one of those uh Kennedy children if you know what i mean and uh
24.358625 25.559125 [silence]
25.559125 32.027375 right now i see a lot of kids who get out of school have no idea what they want to do
32.027375 45.369750 and there's a lot of things out there that we could do uh for our own country let alone other countries and i think that we've got the the people power to do it it's just uh we need
45.369750 51.185000 to channel it and focus it on some things that that need some fixing up um
51.185000 59.008000 some examples are this uh some of the things like Jimmy Carter's been involved in uh a little program to you know fix up housing for people
59.008000 67.758750 and there's a lot of housing ah i know in the area that i live in that's run down and beat up but it could be fixed up and used and it's just you know sitting there wasting away
67.758750 77.474875 [silence]
77.474875 79.875750 [laughter]
79.875750 96.134625 [silence]
96.134625 97.616625 uh-huh
97.616625 133.224750 [silence]
133.224750 141.151625 yeah i think a lot of people grow up with uh with uh preconceived notions li[ke]- what the world's about
141.151625 144.245250 a lot of it has to do from too much TV
144.245250 157.531750 and uh you know it's there's there's a heck of a lot of difference between you know the intake that you get from TV and and movies and what you hear in school and then what reality is
157.531750 170.732750 uh i remember uh i've i've worked since i was well i started delivering papers when i was ten and i had a real job when i was thirteen so i've you know worked most of my life but i remember when i got out of high school
170.732750 181.773125 all through high school was boy i can't wait to get out of high school i can't wait to get out of high school and i wanted to go to college and i had the grades to go to college and i got accepted to college but when i got out of high school i kind of said
181.773125 186.032625 you know what am i going to do now you know it's like
186.032625 195.402125 you know when i actually started working full time and i i got married shortly after getting out of high school i uh thought i was smart ran away and got married
195.402125 203.587750 and uh i remember there was a time and within the first year of marriage i said boy wouldn't i give to get be back in school
203.587750 216.439125 and just have to do homework and and go work my part time job because life and the reality of working for a living and trying to make ends meet is just so overwhelming to someone
216.439125 218.506875 if they aren't prepared for it
218.506875 219.756125 [silence]
219.756125 221.211625 that's true
221.211625 238.836125 [silence]
238.836125 239.992500 yeah
239.992500 243.767125 [silence]
243.767125 245.664625 yeah a
245.664625 260.867250 [silence]
260.867250 262.180000 um
262.180000 271.463250 [silence]
271.463250 272.556750 yeah
272.556750 274.848625 [silence]
274.848625 279.351875 yeah i think once once kids get out and see how
279.351875 285.628125 other people really live and know how bad off some people really are and how good they've got it
285.628125 294.644625 and what it takes to have that good life a[nd]- if you're willing to work for it then they're probably be more inclined to work for it
294.644625 312.866625 [silence]
312.866625 314.843625 uh-huh exactly
314.843625 324.762125 [silence]
324.762125 334.976875 you know i've i've s[o]- i my my parents are in their late sixties now and um so many of the people that live around them are unable to do those things for themselves anymore
334.976875 337.037000 and it's
337.037000 351.137625 it's really hard on them and the you know the thought that i i see the uh the mall rats you know walking around the mall nothing better to do than just walk around the mall all day long when they could be doing something to help someone
351.137625 361.475750 and uh you know you there's a uh a nice warm feeling i remember getting out of doing things like that when i was younger i mean i was a Boy Scout and the whole bit and 
361.475750 373.427125 [silence]
373.427125 374.691875 yeah
374.691875 394.516875 [silence]
394.516875 405.918875 yeah i think there'd there'd be a you know a uh economic benefit for you know everyone concerned those doing the work and those receiving the the uh the services
405.918875 409.970750 [silence]
409.970750 411.394875 yeah
411.394875 426.906250 [silence]
426.906250 435.323625 yeah i think uh President Bush covered that in his uh State of the Union address this year when he said that you know it's time for 
435.323625 442.692125 you know the individuals to start thinking about what they can do to help each other out instead of counting on government to do everything
442.692125 456.307500 [silence]
456.307500 457.399375 yeah
457.399375 460.537500 [silence]

543.861125 545.690750 [silence]
545.690750 554.340125 yeah one of the things they tried to push through in Maryland and uh weren't very successful was that if you were an able bodied person on welfare
554.340125 557.634625 you had to do some work and
557.634625 560.693125 [silence]
560.693125 561.810875 yeah
561.810875 576.254125 [silence]
576.254125 578.747250 that's exactly what they were trying to get them to do
578.747250 583.555625 [silence]
583.555625 586.203875 um both
586.203875 588.243125 [silence]
588.243125 589.967000 yeah they use both
589.967000 591.765500 [silence]
591.765500 597.188750 uh they have a they have another program in Maryland that's called Adopt-A-Highway 
597.188750 599.566000 [noise]


0.000000 0.482625 [silence]
0.482625 3.217250 so do you fish
3.217250 19.220375 [silence]
19.220375 21.549500 uh from a boat or from shore
21.549500 22.888750 [silence]
22.888750 25.187625 oh that's nice uh
25.187625 27.991750 mostly catfish or
27.991750 61.473875 [silence]
61.473875 67.254250 yeah a real light line real light rig well that sounds like fun
67.254250 74.286375 fish in Colorado s[o]- different than that mostly trout
74.286375 76.959250 in the mountains
76.959250 80.653500 yeah yeah mountain streams and rivers
80.653500 86.410750 uh yeah very yeah there isn't much there you know
86.410750 88.605625 [silence]
88.605625 92.099375 um by and large no but but they're big fun
92.099375 95.224500 [silence]
95.224500 96.904625 what
96.904625 100.059125 i i i'm a fly fisherman
100.059125 107.158875 yeah i i cast a ways i'm not highly proficient but it's fun
107.158875 113.167125 [silence]
113.167125 120.895375 well let me explain fly fly fishing to you then you're not casting a weight on the end of the line
120.895375 123.474250 you're casting the weight of the line
123.474250 124.608000 [silence]
124.608000 129.202000 yeah well the fly on the end weighs nothing it weighs less than the line
129.202000 135.883750 so what you do is you strip off oh four five six little rolls
135.883750 139.065250 coils of line into your hand
139.065250 141.649750 and you whip the line
141.649750 143.639375 as you whip it
143.639375 146.450250 over your head or side to side
146.450250 149.261250 you slowly feed out more and more

314.888625 323.662750 fishing is not just just dragging fish out of the water it's it's a total experience you know getting out in nature and
323.662750 332.393750 hearing the crickets and listening to the birds and seeing the squirrels and camping out and eating out of doors and
332.393750 334.228875 [silence]
334.228875 336.954375 uh i probably ought to i just freeze

343.984750 345.910125 slipping it out there
345.910125 351.408750 you know i always intend to just stand on the bank and just kind of slip it out there and 
351.408750 353.956000 you know how it is the water's kind of
353.956000 356.850000 [silence]
356.850000 363.458875 and then you're in to it just a little bit and then you splash in and the next thing you know your knees are wet

435.357750 438.002750 we still had a good time out of the deal
438.002750 439.031250 [silence]
439.031250 440.511125 uh

482.177750 489.516750 [silence]
489.516750 493.399125 oh fishing's fishing is fun up here it's not
493.399125 503.208000 it seems like the success ratio the success rate here is not as good as on some of the better lakes there but
503.208000 507.420000 it is fun you know it
507.420000 517.735625 the the experience is is better up here i think you know it seems more relaxing there's more to look at
517.735625 518.770375 [silence]
518.770375 524.740750 and and there's something about listening to water run that's relaxing to the soul
524.740750 529.205250 you know if you're if you're just sitting on a nice hot lake
529.205250 547.452000 [silence]
547.452000 548.712875 [laughter]
548.712875 555.437750 [silence]
555.437750 559.518625 yeah it it is interesting to watch that water rise all of a sudden
559.518625 575.332875 [silence]
575.332875 576.813250 uh-huh
576.813250 589.980375 [silence]
589.980375 596.553000 yeah i[t]- it gets f[oamy]- foamy almost and you know it's just pure and pristine
596.553000 599.021250 and the froth and

0.000000 1.996250 [silence]
1.996250 8.498875 oh yeah my dad has a lake cabin and so we go there for the small lake uh
8.498875 19.498000 just outside of the Dallas Fort Worth area it takes us about three hours to get there and we go and we fish and we catch a bunch of junk [laughter] nothing nothing to talk about for the most part but it's fun
19.498000 21.109625 [silence]
21.109625 23.197250 from the dock from shore
23.197250 26.670000 [silence]
26.670000 41.661125 oh mostly we catch carp if we're doing good we catch a catfish or two once in a while and you know we go ahead and eat those but we've never caught enough to really have what you'd call a fish fry what we normally do is just uh go ahead and clean it up and then uh
41.661125 54.522625 you know put it in a bag and freeze it and and somebody takes it home and eats it then when there's just a couple people instead of a whole crowd usually there's a pretty good crowd there [laughter-so] we don't ever catch enough to eat carp is usually pretty much fun
54.522625 64.028625 because i've caught up to about an eight pound carp on a little you know a little pole with twenty pound test line and that that's a pretty good fight so that's a lot of fun
64.028625 65.708375 yeah
65.708375 67.938500 they fight hard
67.938500 70.695125 [silence]
70.695125 72.123125 yeah
72.123125 75.666625 [silence]
75.666625 78.186750 yeah and in the rivers and stuff
78.186750 79.903000 [silence]
79.903000 81.497500 are they good to eat
81.497500 86.582250 [silence]
86.582250 89.195250 oh you mean size wise they're not very big
89.195250 91.729750 [silence]
91.729750 98.887750 yeah well i've been is that mostly uh fly fishing when you're doing that or are you fly fishing or are you using a bobber
98.887750 100.447500 yeah
100.447500 106.654625 [silence]
106.654625 113.681500 i've never even tried that my if i don't have a reel with a button on it i tend to get so much [laughter-backlash] [laughter-it's] not worth the [laughter-trouble]
113.681500 119.877250 [silence]
119.877250 121.281500 uh-huh
121.281500 123.191125 [silence]
123.191125 127.428000 with the little thing on the end yeah i thought it had a weight
127.428000 128.489000 [silence]
128.489000 129.606375 oh
129.606375 137.611250 [silence]

138.741875 141.333625 [silence]
141.333625 142.317875 um
142.317875 144.613625 [silence]
144.613625 146.072875 uh-huh
146.072875 149.011000 [silence]
149.011000 149.985000 um
149.985000 153.101875 so you're fishing downstream so it will carry some
153.101875 155.269000 oh you fish upstream
155.269000 157.429000 [silence]
157.429000 158.479375 uh-huh
158.479375 159.533375 [silence]
159.533375 161.935000 you hope that they think it's a bug and
161.935000 164.123125 and eat it yeah
164.123125 176.817000 [silence]
176.817000 178.472750 that's a fish
178.472750 180.226875 [silence]
180.226875 182.441000 oh it's a it's a lure
182.441000 183.530000 [silence]
183.530000 184.803250 i see
184.803250 189.844125 [silence]
189.844125 191.179500 uh-huh
191.179500 193.745375 [silence]
193.745375 195.091500 oh

197.986250 199.233750 uh-huh
199.233750 209.977125 [silence]
209.977125 211.158500 um
211.158500 216.230500 did someone just come up with this design and and you're going to make one for yourself or are you going to buy it
216.230500 218.687750 [silence]
218.687750 219.853875 uh-huh
219.853875 222.482750 [silence]
222.482750 226.637250 oh it's just that that just happens to be what the fish like this year huh
226.637250 227.660125 um
227.660125 229.999375 [silence]
229.999375 239.735250 [laughter] i guess so we tend to use just bait and a few lures but bait tends to work the best just some blood bait
239.735250 244.050000 oh are you where are you from oh i'm from Midland
244.050000 249.221875 i went to college at Tech so you've been out to Buffalo Gap fishing
249.221875 251.612000 yeah i've been up there
251.612000 254.406250 i didn't catch anything but i've been up there [laughter]
254.406250 258.171625 [silence]
258.171625 268.011125 yeah it's fun it's lazy take a picnic lunch i used to do that with my dad every once in a while we'd go out on a Saturday and just spend the day before it got too hot
268.011125 271.884125 [silence]
271.884125 276.178000 yeah [laughter] yeah we do most of our fishing at night
276.178000 281.314750 just from the heat of it all that's one advantage you've certainly got on us
281.314750 284.554875 [silence]
284.554875 294.708125 it does i've only been up there once in the summer well no i've been up there twice in the summer but both times it was really pleasant in fact it snowed on us in in
294.708125 301.860125 gosh when was that we were in Mesa Verde Park and it was like the end of Ju[ne]- it was just before July fourth 
301.860125 312.405875 and it was twenty eight twenty nine degrees we were out in this silly tent with regular little sleeping bags not knowing any better [laughter] and here it went and it froze and it snowed on us 
312.405875 314.773000 we did not know what to do about it
314.773000 322.195500 [silence]
322.195500 323.777500 yeah
323.777500 325.831375 [silence]

334.729750 336.465750 [silence]
336.465750 340.171750 oh goodness it must be a little bit cold
340.171750 342.633250 that's cold water around there
342.633250 345.080000 [silence]
345.080000 346.241500 um
346.241500 347.692250 do you have any

350.696375 352.188500 [silence]
352.188500 357.902750 yeah and you get you get a little more carried away with it and you move a little closer
357.902750 360.768875 [silence]
360.768875 362.668375 yeah
362.668375 365.723625 [laughter] do you have any kids that you take fishing
365.723625 368.129375 [silence]

374.810500 376.511250 [silence]
376.511250 389.950500 [laughter] i have a three and a half year old and a one and a half year old and the little one of course is could care less the uh three and a half year old has just gotten to the point we got him a little pole last year and just put uh
389.950500 401.736000 his big thing last year was throwing it in the water and reeling it up [laughter] that was what he considered fishing [laughter] this year he's gotten to where he can we we were at a friend's uh stock pond we were out at their farm
401.736000 411.379375 and and they had been fishing and let him use the pole while we wal[ked]- we all walked off a healthy hundred yards or so and let him fish and he started trying to cast it
411.379375 415.320125 so he he was kind of getting there but he's
415.320125 423.981000 he's at a dangerous point [laughter-right] [laughter-now] he understands the mechanics of pushing the button and throw but not necessarily the direction it's going to go in
423.981000 425.032125 [silence]
425.032125 426.595375 yeah
426.595375 436.586125 [silence]
436.586125 439.295750 yeah well that's good

451.113000 452.706125 [silence]
452.706125 459.994125 well yeah but TI is up there so [laughter] that part of it would probably work out
459.994125 462.762000 i'm sorry what
462.762000 467.539375 we're both uh i was uh military but he's division three
467.539375 472.316750 it goes back and forth Division well maybe division one right now he's in computers
472.316750 479.420625 so and he's in school and everything else i have some friends who work up there
479.420625 481.543500 Kathy and Kevin Guy
481.543500 490.632750 yeah and they like to fish they've been inviting us to come up there in the summer her dad has a cabin and they go fishing up there
490.632750 494.076125 so that would be neat to try it some time
494.076125 504.073000 [silence]
504.073000 508.407125 yeah long as you have a good time that's the main point so
508.407125 511.910125 [silence]
511.910125 513.187625 uh-huh
513.187625 516.943375 [silence]
516.943375 520.953625 [laughter] definitely more to look at 
520.953625 523.841875 [silence]
523.841875 525.204125 yeah
525.204125 528.797875 [silence]
528.797875 536.392000 yeah the only thing you've got to watch is when that creek comes up we camped next to one one time when we were there a couple of summers ago
536.392000 547.104625 and we figured we were up a long way off and then it rained that night and we thought well wonder how far off we are and we got up the next day and that creek that had been fifty or sixty feet from our site of our tent was now about
547.104625 555.596250 three feet away and it's like oh well maybe we ought to move just a touch so that was kind of funny
555.596250 559.175750 [silence]
559.175750 571.337875 yeah i just love the way it looks i could almost just watch the wa[ter]- we in fact we have gotten out on on trips before and just stopped and watched it because there was so much and if you were there i mean it was
571.337875 585.306375 one time we were there and i guess it was late May so it was really your spring almost you know at even though it was it was really summer down here and and the i guess the creek the mountains were really starting to melt and the creek was just wild just running
585.306375 590.614750 and and all the white water and noise and the it was just beautiful
590.614750 592.695125 [silence]
592.695125 593.849750 uh-huh
593.849750 595.560375 [silence]
595.560375 596.857625 yeah
596.857625 599.021250 [silence]

0.000000 0.252125 [silence]
0.252125 4.994125 well thanks for being home uh on the weekend i uh i'm actually working at night and uh
4.994125 9.736125 there very few people that are on the list for calls uh on the weekends nights
9.736125 15.053750 [silence]
15.053750 17.673375 are are you part of the school system out there
17.673375 20.401375 [silence]
20.401375 32.078000 uh the reason i said that because i've had about uh three calls and my daughter had one too from different students out of North Carolina i guess they pass the names amongst your computer students or whatever
32.078000 34.241875 [silence]
34.241875 36.197000 oh is that ri[ght]- great great
36.197000 39.302250 [silence]
39.302250 41.369000 oh is that right that's wonderful
41.369000 50.321500 [silence]
50.321500 60.533375 oh yeah i talked to one we're not on the subject of course i talked to one i think he had a whole bunch of calls he had a roommate that had calls and everything he had way more twice as many calls as as i've made uh
60.533375 69.418250 and i i'm of course we at TI just hoping it works out that the new products that they come out will uh sell like gang books bu[sters]- busters really
69.418250 74.163875 okay you first on the subject wha[t]- what do you think about Latin America
74.163875 91.744000 Latin America yeah
91.744000 93.298000 oh really
93.298000 106.111250 TI had a place i'm not to sure i don't think they do anymore down i think it was Campinas i'm not sure and uh i guess we were selling parts to the automotive industry or whatever and they had quite a few
106.111250 116.446375 locations not quite a few several uh in Latin America i think the one in Mexico is closed and i think the one in Brazil is closed but i
116.446375 122.779625 i don't know why that is a problem down there and i guess the crime rate is terrible up here too and uh
122.779625 135.862250 and some people say go to New York but i don't i don't have an answer to the crime rate it's sad that is a sad situation i i'd like to go down to Mexico you know and i keep hearing that you know the government and and the crime rates pretty high too that that is sad
135.862250 149.912875 uh not that we can uh sell any great program we have with crime but uh i think uh i'm kind of like you i don't have any strong opinions on it i guess maybe that's our biggest problem we have with our our neighbors down there is that we don't have any we have more
149.912875 159.888000 i guess ties we in the United States have more ties to Europe and everything and we don't really aren't that close to everyone in South America i don't really know why though
159.888000 172.542750 [silence]
172.542750 173.754625 right
173.754625 182.528750 [silence]
182.528750 192.726750 right yeah i know that i saw in a book i was reading a Spanish book uh not that i read Spanish you know i just you know reading some Spanish words and there was a comment in there about
192.726750 201.672875 the Mexicans don't really want us to say we're Americans they would like to say that we're North Americans because they're Americans too you know and i guess that's true we don't think of
201.672875 212.416625 any one else but oursel[ves]- i guess we're kind of uh the smart asses in the world i suppose uh or of America anyway we think of ourselves as the only Americans when they're Americans too
212.416625 224.768875 [silence]
224.768875 227.486625 as Mexicans yes that that
227.486625 229.506000 [laughter]
229.506000 231.995125 [silence]
231.995125 234.005250 no no i know
234.005250 245.777625 [silence]
245.777625 258.802375 yeah no i mean they were saying that of us that we're the North Americans and they're Americans they they we always say we're Americans and they they want us to say we're the North Americans we're not Americans we're North Americans and they're South Americans yeah
258.802375 263.393500 whatever i i don't want to make i read it somewhere though it's not my point i guess [laughter]
263.393500 268.171750 [silence]
268.171750 278.756625 no no they they were lucky enough to have some oil what ten years ago an and they they blew all that and borrowed enou[gh]- more money than they can pay back now and uh
278.756625 290.831750 uh so they're not exactly business men i do think we should deal more with them i don't i do have a lot of sympathy in that we're here in Texas uh for the language you know is very foolish
290.831750 305.487000 i'm relative relatively familiar with Texas school system and we should teach Spanish at least in uh grammar school you know four or five grades of it so that we can speak Spanish i think that helps
305.487000 317.159500 when you certainly can speak their language uh and there are problems with you know the wet back problem you know for everyone knows what we're talking about when say wet back problem and then we should somehow
317.159500 332.005625 uh and i think the governments are working on that to try to have some uh businesses uh at the borders of both sides so that you can you don't have this problem of them trying to come up here and to to get the jobs you know there there may be some organized way to do this
332.005625 344.820500 i i do feel for them uh they are very envious of us or they wouldn't be coming up here you know risking a lot not that they're risking their lives of course but risking a lot uh getting thrown back i guess is all that uh happens
344.820500 352.668750 you probably don't see that where we see it you know once a month i'm sure in San Antonio they see it more often than that
352.668750 354.975625 okay well you see it saw it out there then too
354.975625 362.199500 [silence]
362.199500 363.257750 uh-huh
363.257750 373.657375 [silence]
373.657375 374.898500 yeah
374.898500 379.004875 [silence]
379.004875 391.498500 i think a a common factor to a lot of problems both whether it be crime if if you want to jump on that is mostly uh poverty uh and i think a lot of their problems is poverty if we could
391.498500 405.716250 uh uh the problems we have you know in this country is is a lot of it's poverty whether it's the people aren't trying hard enough to get out of poverty i that's another story but uh uh it is sad there there's so much down in all of South America
405.716250 419.140625 uh so much potential you know we're TI of course is is really pushing world markets in their products and they're they're mostly in in Europe now and in in in the Orient Japan and Singapore now just announced
419.140625 434.103125 building a plant in Singapore uh they're in Taiwan and Japan and they're they haven't had what that much luck in South America and there's got to be a lot of potential for business down there for the products certainly that we make and everything
434.103125 449.092250 and there's got to be trade i guess that's some of the answer i guess is business uh uh and i try to be an optimist and say well that that's one way is to help any problem whether it be crime or certainly poverty obviously is to is to get some business going between each other
449.092250 455.103750 and we need we need to do more of that uh somehow and encourage more business between us
455.103750 466.680250 they've got to have a lot of resources i would think an enormous amount of of well potential that way a lot of it of course is hot and jungle and all that but uh there's got to be a lot of potential down there
466.680250 467.835250 [silence]
467.835250 470.376625 what are what are you taking in school i didn't ask you that
470.376625 472.287375 what are you taking in school
472.287375 474.895500 oh you you're an instructor yeah you're an instructor yeah you said
474.895500 479.064750 [silence]
479.064750 480.732875 that's great are you
480.732875 484.670125 teaching Computer Science wha[t]- you said what were you saying you were teaching there
484.670125 486.666375 great great
486.666375 500.814500 [silence]
500.814500 502.776750 right
502.776750 514.214375 i of course i work at TI and i'm a little puzzled as to why when they get my voice one time why that isn't enough i mean i'm i'm i'm getting a kick out of the whole program but uh
514.214375 524.039000 there's going to be i guess thousands i don't know how many thousands or tens of thousands of these recordings and i wonder how they're going to analyze them whether it would be
524.039000 529.888625 listening to them or analyzing i g[uess]- they've got to be analyzing with a a voice recorder some how
529.888625 532.864750 [silence]
532.864750 534.039250 uh-huh
534.039250 538.471500 [silence]
538.471500 539.509875 right
539.509875 549.466875 [silence]
549.466875 563.483125 oh yes i know they change with age i know mine changes uh has changed uh although you you never found your your voice echoes in your own head which is makes it different than what it really sounds to other people
563.483125 570.754375 uh i'm sure singers and professional people know that and you always hear your own voice in recordings and say my God that's that's not obviously that's not me you know
570.754375 574.965000 but uh i know your voice in your own head resonates a different way
574.965000 576.926375 [silence]
576.926375 589.712125 uh go ahead you you comment on it yeah i'm glad that you're in the business that i know TI's gotten with their Speak and Spell and everything i've told my wife that one of the reasons they're doing it is because eventually you'll be able to talk to your computer you wouldn't have to have a keyboard
589.712125 598.682000 you'll be able to just give it commands and i'm sure they have some of that now and not not in computers but a lot of potential of course for handicapped people

0.000000 9.241500 [silence]
9.241500 15.704875 uh-huh yeah well sometimes i'm home and sometimes i'm not but if i am it's always fun to talk
15.704875 17.325000 [silence]
17.325000 20.924500 i am as a matter of fact i'm at uh North Carolina State
20.924500 31.609875 [silence]
31.609875 35.129375 yeah i think i was the one who did that actually
35.129375 39.866000 yeah i had a uh i teach a course in Voice I O Systems
39.866000 40.899375 [silence]
40.899375 50.981125 so i know uh you know i know about this project so i got my students to sign up and uh apparently a number of them have been participating
50.981125 59.845875 [silence]
59.845875 61.079375 uh-huh
61.079375 69.062000 [silence]
69.062000 70.413000 yeah
70.413000 71.720750 [silence]
71.720750 75.826875 uh let's see the subject is Latin America
75.826875 85.021625 i don't know whether i have any real profound thoughts about that i actually wa[s]- was planning a trip to Latin America and i got warned off by
85.021625 93.669250 some people they say Peru can't be traveled to and the crime rate in Brazil makes it not a pleasant place to go and so on and so forth
93.669250 134.572125 [silence]
134.572125 136.334125 yeah
136.334125 160.206750 [silence]
160.206750 165.563875 yeah i i don't understand it either although i i think a lot of South Americans
165.563875 172.487875 regard the United States as as bullying and uh that's certainly from a historical point of view
172.487875 183.336875 would be true i mean certainly we took far more from Mexico than Saddam Hussein ever dreamed of taking in in his wildest dreams from his neighbors
183.336875 211.065000 [silence]
211.065000 220.271875 yeah well i think they're going to have that's a tough row for them to to hoe because i think most of the world is going to regard
220.271875 232.640875 uh citizens of the United States as Americans and citizens of Mexico as Mexicans and they can stand on their heads if they want too but i don't think that they're going they're going to change that and
232.640875 246.263625 and and really i mean North Americans i think are when you say that even i think i mean i tend to think of Americans and Canadians i just don't think of Mexicans as being North Americans although i guess strictly speaking they are
246.263625 252.130875 [silence]
252.130875 254.607750 oh i see
254.607750 257.998250 [silence]
257.998250 259.601250 i don't know
259.601250 261.431750 [silence]
261.431750 267.957125 yeah well it's it's so interesting i ju[st]- i just don't think Mexico's problems are going to be cured by semantics
267.957125 329.220625 [silence]
329.220625 331.750000 yeah
331.750000 343.513625 [silence]
343.513625 345.010750 yeah
345.010750 349.814125 [silence]
349.814125 352.829000 well i grew up in Los Angeles
352.829000 358.699375 and uh in fact i drove a cab when i was a graduate student so i i knew uh
358.699375 362.044500 the Hispanic part of LA pretty well
362.044500 373.275625 and certainly you know knew that problem knew you know knew about apartment houses that would have eight or ten or twelve people living in them sleeping in the same bed in shifts and all that
373.275625 374.747500 and uh
374.747500 376.516250 it was
376.516250 378.478250 it was pretty wild
378.478250 431.920625 [silence]
431.920625 433.489750 yeah
433.489750 452.484750 [silence]
452.484750 454.214875 yeah
454.214875 466.635000 [silence]
466.635000 468.246625 yeah
468.246625 470.361500 i'm sorry
470.361500 473.032625 well i am actually
473.032625 474.970000 yeah i'm the
474.970000 478.415125 i'm the teacher i give [laughter]
478.415125 479.713500 as it were
479.713500 482.016000 [silence]
482.016000 484.535250 yeah i'm in Computer Science
484.535250 492.949000 and uh very interested in voice systems and in speech recognition but of course this project is really one to collect a data base of
492.949000 501.505250 of uh of casual speech uh in an attempt to get some kind of a model of what speech is like
501.505250 527.846625 [silence]
527.846625 537.541875 yeah well they record these and then somebody transcribes them so that they they have uh they have a speech signal and what and what is said
537.541875 548.492375 and they have a they're able to average it over a number of different occasions because peoples voices change a lot even from morning to evening and that's uh a big problem in speech recognition
548.492375 560.043250 [silence]
560.043250 561.897125 yeah
561.897125 568.917125 [silence]
568.917125 570.118125 yeah
570.118125 587.569000 [silence]
587.569000 588.874875 right
588.874875 598.682000 [silence]

0.000000 3.459750 [silence]
3.459750 6.263625 i think we're overtaxed to the hilt [noise]
6.263625 11.472500 yeah i mean we're we're taxed on taxes and um
11.472500 16.262750 uh most all government entities are just trying to give us a state
16.262750 24.939375 income tax for those who don't have it that is i mean we don't have one yet but eventually they may try to push it through
24.939375 27.623250 [silence]
27.623250 29.904625 no no state income tax
29.904625 31.736625 [silence]
31.736625 33.045750 uh-huh
33.045750 38.625750 [silence]
38.625750 43.039500 yeah i think what needs to be done is they need to control their spending habits
43.039500 54.738125 [silence]
54.738125 56.107000 right
56.107000 61.867625 [silence]
61.867625 62.951750 yeah
62.951750 74.845000 [silence]
74.845000 76.506125 well we're
76.506125 81.698875 really overburdened from federal state and local
81.698875 86.040250 that it takes such a size out of your paycheck that
86.040250 87.456750 [silence]
87.456750 90.627875 there's not a whole lot you can always do with your paycheck
90.627875 111.555375 [silence]
111.555375 112.881125 uh-huh
112.881125 122.957000 [silence]
122.957000 127.677000 well they're kind of put into a trap of being
127.677000 132.567625 out there to please the special interest groups as well
132.567625 140.815375 and uh i think the only way that can be changed for us to get a a better tax revenue
140.815375 144.730250 that's fairness and all is for us to limit their terms
144.730250 146.072500 [silence]
146.072500 149.657500 and by doing so they're not obligated to anybody
149.657500 151.590875 [silence]
151.590875 152.695000 and uh
152.695000 153.840000 [silence]
153.840000 160.665750 and uh i don't know how we're going to do that right away though but what what in general though that taxes are doing to us is
160.665750 161.911125 [silence]
161.911125 165.739125 it's just taking uh [noise] a bite out of our savings
165.739125 179.988875 [silence]
179.988875 181.236000 yeah
181.236000 200.685875 [silence]
200.685875 205.146375 and i believe the Social Security tax is a great {pondsy} scheme
205.146375 206.703875 [silence]
206.703875 212.871250 yeah it's uh you know right now they're robbing from it to pad the federal deficit
212.871250 214.394750 [silence]
214.394750 221.844375 and i bet that's illegal see if uh most company uh CEOs were to do that
221.844375 224.632125 within their private company they'd be in jail
224.632125 228.701625 [laughter] so how are we letting them get away with it
228.701625 231.703125 [silence]
231.703125 232.609250 right

243.046125 247.000250 [silence]
247.000250 256.138000 a lot of people have become too complacent and believe everything is just the norm as to the way things are going and
256.138000 258.268375 feel absolutely helpless
258.268375 259.577250 to
259.577250 263.991250 to oppose a lot of the situations going on
263.991250 266.196750 in the taxing system
266.196750 274.553625 [silence]
274.553625 275.891750 yeah

290.997750 293.537250 [silence]
293.537250 298.438250 well there's no quick solution or no sure fire
298.438250 300.220250 easy answer
300.220250 302.453000 it's just going to take uh
302.453000 303.473750 [silence]
303.473750 306.425750 uh really uh uh uh
306.425750 311.312750 a combination effort i think of the majority of the American people to
311.312750 312.369875 [silence]
312.369875 316.403375 come to a decisive answer
316.403375 318.183750 or
318.183750 320.317625 vote
320.317625 322.159375 to
322.159375 324.690375 limit
324.690375 327.010250 the way it's spent
327.010250 332.911750 see we we're we have no say so as to where the money goes in the first place that's
332.911750 336.293375 [silence]
336.293375 340.385125 right and they are controlled or
340.385125 343.435250 pretty much do what they want to do
343.435250 369.384000 [silence]
369.384000 373.770125 well they feel invu[lnerable]- invulnerable to uh
373.770125 379.340625 any wrath or uh it's it's occurred so many times that
379.340625 382.940250 they figure people will usually forget and
382.940250 386.305375 don't think about it when the election time arises
386.305375 387.380125 [silence]
387.380125 390.255125 and generally it does work out that way
390.255125 402.619125 [silence]
402.619125 403.908750 uh-huh
403.908750 410.672625 [silence]
410.672625 411.953125 yeah
411.953125 427.021250 [silence]
427.021250 430.004375 well when you get out into the real world then you will know
430.004375 439.226500 [silence]
439.226500 440.654000 yeah
440.654000 443.055500 [silence]
443.055500 444.889500 bonus time you have a bonus
444.889500 446.183500 [silence]
446.183500 448.053625 oh
448.053625 449.125375 [silence]
449.125375 450.148125 uh-huh
450.148125 451.424000 [silence]
451.424000 454.773000 so you're taxed on the bonuses too right
454.773000 459.450000 [silence]
459.450000 461.094750 uh-huh
461.094750 467.988500 [silence]
467.988500 469.241875 uh-huh
469.241875 471.059375 [silence]
471.059375 472.312750 uh-huh
472.312750 480.338500 [silence]
480.338500 485.965875 uh sales is lucrative but then you're paying really high taxes when you're doing a lucrative job
485.965875 493.122375 [silence]
493.122375 494.546125 uh-huh
494.546125 504.652000 [silence]
504.652000 506.065000 yeah
506.065000 507.349125 [silence]
507.349125 509.531000 well i have
509.531000 513.489375 i guess about said what all all i can think of to say
513.489375 514.973000 [silence]
514.973000 519.702750 yeah it's re[ally]- a rather touchy topic at that but [laughter]
519.702750 522.103500 [silence]
522.103500 524.233500 well that's great
524.233500 527.643125 you too and uh have a good day
527.643125 530.083625 [noise]

0.000000 1.041625 [silence]
1.041625 3.088375 so uh what do you think [laughter]
3.088375 5.384500 [silence]
5.384500 6.866500 yeah
6.866500 24.503000 [silence]
24.503000 27.730375 oh really so they have n[o]- i didn't realize they had no state tax in Texas
27.730375 28.880500 [silence]
28.880500 32.373625 oh that's great because they don't have it in Florida in New York they have it
32.373625 36.403125 i mean you know like i say i'm in New York and we have a state tax as well
36.403125 38.299500 so that just cuts even more
38.299500 42.682625 [silence]
42.682625 51.870500 right i i think that i i mean i wouldn't be so upset about the amount of taxes paid if it weren't for the fact that they don't they don't go to any place
51.870500 55.549375 you know y[ou]- you don't see it going to any place where it belongs
55.549375 57.742250 i think if it were to be uh
57.742250 59.424750 if it were to be um
59.424750 63.002250 if it were to be hold hold on a second please someone just walked in the door
63.002250 65.886250 [noise]
65.886250 75.615875 if if it were to spent in the right way i think wouldn't be so upset about it but given that it's not spent properly i think it's a major problem
75.615875 90.069875 [silence]
90.069875 94.681750 well that's certainly true well what is it they were just talking about um
94.681750 105.696000 sort of middle income you know how how middle income people what winds up happening is for instance having kids you know they wind up having kids as a deduction and after
105.696000 112.188250 but the deduction is so little for kids that they wind up having to pay more in taxes than it costs to raise a kid for the year or something
112.188250 118.846500 i think tha[t]- so they want to you know try an[d]- i think they're trying i think tha[t]- i think that most of the politicians understand this
118.846500 123.714500 they just don't they're just not very good at doing what they're supposed to be doing
123.714500 131.354500 [silence]
131.354500 132.729250 right
132.729250 144.743250 [silence]
144.743250 146.344875 uh-huh
146.344875 149.996125 [silence]
149.996125 151.496500 i agree
151.496500 152.722625 i agree
152.722625 165.766625 [silence]
165.766625 168.942000 right exactly and then and then uh
168.942000 180.557000 uh i'm i'm just not sure if i see you know if i see it going like i say to the right places i mean it'd be it'd be one thing if it were taking a bite out of your savings and then you were getting it all back when you got older
180.557000 185.449125 you know but i'm not convinced that's a that that Social Security is doing as well as it should and
185.449125 197.474500 you know and and and uh and and that you know those people who need it for welfare and so forth who really need it for welfare not the eighty five to ninety percent of them who don't need it but i mean the real people who really need it
197.474500 201.048125 you know should be getting it but instead i think it's going to the wrong places
201.048125 205.149625 [silence]
205.149625 206.677000 you think so
206.677000 211.693125 [silence]
211.693125 214.998625 i know and that scares the hell out of me
214.998625 224.687125 [silence]
224.687125 225.404875 yeah
225.404875 228.175125 [silence]
228.175125 241.775500 yeah i don't i don't well becau[se]- because they're the ones who make the laws [laughter] so who's going to yell at them you know it'd be nice if we sort of as one band together and and uh and an performed a citizens arrest i guess
241.775500 247.676125 to see if we could sort of clean them up and you know but i don't know if we can do that or not
247.676125 265.839875 [silence]
265.839875 275.290000 i agree i agree but um yeah like like you said i wonder you know if if it's certainly not going to be a slow change process and i wonder if it'll ever be a change process
275.290000 280.236750 i sort of i sort of get discouraged when i think about all the things that i think are wrong
280.236750 283.387000 you know all those things that really could be changed that
283.387000 289.160250 aren't you know that that aren't and taxes is one of those things that just sort of sits way up there on the list
289.160250 290.926750 [silence]
290.926750 294.080375 so i don't know i i i have no idea what to do about it
294.080375 327.079125 [silence]
327.079125 327.977250 yeah
327.977250 330.601125 [silence]
330.601125 337.073625 right we don't i mean the only say so we have is supposedly by electing people who we think are going to vote one way of another
337.073625 342.776875 [silence]
342.776875 344.010875 right
344.010875 350.000375 i've never quite understood that i've never uh you know even though um i i've never been
350.000375 354.515000 uh sort of politically minded but it's never been clear to me as to sort of
354.515000 355.534875 um
355.534875 362.968375 you know how Congressmen an can can just sort of go ahead and vote their own conscience as their own ideas
362.968375 367.006250 when clearly their constituency doe[s]- doesn't back them up on anything you know
367.006250 369.224625 and often times that will happen
369.224625 372.095375 [silence]
372.095375 373.010750 right
373.010750 385.815250 [silence]
385.815250 386.785875 right
386.785875 389.394500 [silence]
389.394500 403.280500 they do forget it's true coul[d]- because everybody think of what happens is whenever the politic[ian]- whenever th[e]- the one who made that supposed mistake turns around and uh his his or her opponent can say well look they did this and they can turn around and say well my opponent did this
403.280500 405.106750 so it becomes uh
405.106750 407.214250 a general battle of
407.214250 411.232750 the w[ho]- sort of the election of the lesser of two evils
411.232750 412.414000 i think so
412.414000 413.934125 i don't know
413.934125 420.950375 i just uh i'm unhappy with it but and well i'm i'm sort of semi fortunate right now i'm a graduate student
420.950375 427.244125 so i don't make that much what i make isn't taxed very highly because i'm still in school
427.244125 428.250000 but
428.250000 429.390000 it's
429.390000 439.412625 my my my wife has a real job and you know when i get her job um you know we we look at her paycheck i'm just floored when i see how little of it we're actually allowed to keep
439.412625 441.309500 [silence]
441.309500 443.686625 especially around bonus time
443.686625 446.917750 bonus she no my my wife does
446.917750 451.715875 my wi[fe]- i don['t]- no graduate students don't get bonuses we're lucky to get paychecks the way i figure
451.715875 453.140875 [silence]
453.140875 456.683875 my my wife is taxed on her bonus as well and that's a
456.683875 465.067250 that's usually a big chunk of her bonus check actually i mean her bonus isn't that much but they tax it as i i guess they tax it as if
465.067250 468.466750 that were her weekly check or something
468.466750 471.205875 so she gets destroyed on her bonus check
471.205875 474.761500 so she works with in in in sales
474.761500 480.125875 so a good portion of her you know her salary is is quarterly bonuses
480.125875 485.309000 [silence]
485.309000 493.849000 yes well yeah she's not entirely sales so it isn't it isn't as lucrative as one would hope but it it keeps us supported temporarily
493.849000 497.000375 until i can get a real salary and then get taxed more
497.000375 502.997250 so i don't know i d[on't]- i guess i guess at this point in time we're just sort of going to have to live with it
502.997250 504.983250 and hope that it gets better
504.983250 512.814625 [silence]
512.814625 515.159375 same here tough topic so
515.159375 518.287375 [silence]

259.493500 273.710875 you maybe sometimes do not take as much time for the older ones but uh we were we're very active of course at church and uh Boy Scouting and Girl Scouts Four H

405.554375 412.244000 and i have mixed feelings about that she's able to do that and i don't know if she'd be happy to stay at home
412.244000 425.773125 but yet on the other hand i i've got the mixed feelings that i think you should be at home with your children i'm kind of old fashioned i guess that way but they seem to they seem to give uh quality time
425.773125 436.769000 to those children when they are together and and so it seems it seems for them that it works out all right
436.769000 445.816375 so i don't know i i don't think i ever would have had what it would take to work full time and raise a family i

573.749750 576.974750 [silence]
576.974750 588.479875 oh well he made it at fifty [laughter] it was a magic number for him and and uh he went at fifty and he still works part time at other thing you know
588.479875 594.326375 same job as he was doing only he's retired and doing it independently but uh
594.326375 595.353500 [silence]
595.353500 597.496250 nevertheless retired
597.496250 599.884000 [silence]

0.000000 3.739125 [noise]
3.739125 7.485875 okay i uh i have five children all together
7.485875 16.979625 uh my oldest two are already out and about in the world and i uh have a set of twins that are fourteen and uh my youngest is twelve
16.979625 18.698750 [silence]
18.698750 23.019625 uh yeah if you like doing everything twice
23.019625 25.498500 uh at any rate um
25.498500 28.493000 my first two children uh
28.493000 31.241000 i didn't spend a whole lot of time with them
31.241000 45.739500 um and you know was a a problem with having five children needing to work a uh a full-time job that was more than a full-time job i worked about fifty one hours a week because i worked every worked eleven hours every Sunday 
45.739500 53.487125 and uh so i didn't get to spend as much time with them as i as i should have as i really wanted to
53.487125 61.492000 yeah the yeah the f[amily]- well it was with all of them but it was uh more an impact i think on the oldest two
61.492000 63.496125 because um
63.496125 66.284125 oh about the time i got out of working
66.284125 74.319500 that long hours was when the uh when the twins were about three years old and uh they never you know i don't think they
74.319500 82.449750 noticed i wasn't around that much you know with all the children around the house it's kind of hard to notice that dad isn't around very much um
82.449750 86.464625 so what i've tried to do uh now
86.464625 93.013500 that i've uh fi[nally]- went back to school and got my degree when i was thirty years old and uh so
93.013500 106.976500 then i came out and was making as much money forty hours a week as i did fifty one hours a week so i've tried to spend more time with uh the children since then um what i'm currently doing is uh taking a lot of time um 
106.976500 119.522500 helping the kids more with their homework in the evenings um we just started a thing where every other week we go to uh movies there's a movie theater that offers dollar movies on Wednesday nights
119.522500 124.754000 and so every couple of weeks we will go to the movies because that's how often they change the movies and
124.754000 137.491750 it's working out pretty well um we're spending more time together i feel like i'm a lot closer to the three that are still living at home than i ever was to the two that were living there before um 
137.491750 149.726375 and in fact i found that i'm a lot closer with uh i have one son who's gone and i don't even know where he's at um he's taken off for parts unknown but uh yeah a[nd]- and uh my
149.726375 152.214875 daughter is um
152.214875 158.997500 has moved out of the house her and i get along a lot better now that she's moved [laughter] out of the house [laughter]
158.997500 160.740250 [laughter]
160.740250 163.972000 and uh so it's it's it's
163.972000 175.810875 it's been difficult to try to find the time and i think it's important that we do because um i notice that uh when i had spent two years down in Dallas down there they all have a uh
175.810875 177.674500 a me kind of attitude
177.674500 187.688000 and i noticed parents not spending time with their children and and going out and doing things and you know i knew like the kids next door were all into cocaine and
187.688000 192.692250 you know it just you know i saw the family falling apart down there
192.692250 198.252250 [silence]
198.252250 210.224375 yeah and so i think it's kind of important that i that i you know nurture the relationship i have with my children now and i'm doing my best to keep that up
210.224375 211.268500 [silence]
211.268500 213.491500 yeah what's your been your experience
213.491500 216.765500 [silence]
216.765500 222.510375 um she didn't up until the last oh six months
222.510375 223.994875 uh
223.994875 236.239375 she just recently started working uh she worked a job until we moved to our new house and uh she quit that job because it was too inconvenient and uh she starts a new job tomorrow which should take her out of the house about four days a week
236.239375 243.998750 [silence]
243.998750 245.043875 huh
245.043875 246.975500 [silence]
246.975500 248.229750 [laughter]
248.229750 263.480750 [silence]

264.500000 277.346250 [silence]
277.346250 300.733500 uh-huh
300.733500 310.963375 [silence]
310.963375 312.975875 certainly do
312.975875 322.489875 [silence]
322.489875 323.995000 uh-huh
323.995000 327.995750 [silence]
327.995750 329.488375 [laughter]
329.488375 332.997375 [silence]
332.997375 340.991500 yeah that sounds great i've i've noticed uh another thing um when i was younger my father was always working and
340.991500 351.725500 yeah and uh you know he uh he worked a full-time job and a part-time job and i never saw him so i didn't have much of a role model to go by
351.725500 355.300750 you know to learn how to be a a father and a parent
355.300750 362.249750 and that kind of thing because i i can't ever remember playing ball with my dad or catch with my dad or doing anything with my dad
362.249750 363.485375 [silence]
363.485375 375.222625 yeah and it if you don't have i don't i it's my feeling that if you don't have a role model to follow then it's kind of tough you know everybody's not Father Knows Best
375.222625 376.665125 yeah but
376.665125 377.860375 [silence]
377.860375 379.242875 yeah

384.231750 385.379000 [silence]
385.379000 396.980000 yeah i mean the the the capability to uh create children doesn't necessarily mean you have the uh the mental capacity to raise them [laughter] and
396.980000 420.222125 [silence]
420.222125 421.996125 yes
421.996125 443.982500 [silence]
443.982500 451.481250 yes it's it's not easy i've uh you know i've helped out extremely
451.481250 461.493000 uh well i can't say that but i've helped out [laughter] as best i could at home and uh y[ou]- as you know with five children it takes a lot of work
461.493000 466.173375 even if even if someone's home all the time there's still a lot of things that have to be done
466.173375 468.252625 [silence]
468.252625 473.664375 uh well now i work for Texas Instruments so so i'm in computers

487.361750 489.497250 uh right
489.497250 498.499125 yeah it uh it was uh it was a a smart move to make um i was more intelligent than the position i was holding
498.499125 500.994125 and uh it was
500.994125 502.491000 [silence]
502.491000 516.306500 yes i i felt that it certainly was i mean i was smarter than most of the people that i was working for and uh you know every time something new came up i was explaining it to them and uh i had
516.306500 519.474875 [laughter] yeah i uh
519.474875 531.983250 yeah i uh started back to school in fact i was going to school while i was working fifty one hours a week and that's why i you know if you're working if you're taking twelve credits at night and you're working fifty one hours a week there's not much time left to spend with 
531.983250 534.994500 [silence]

498.764125 502.668750 [silence]
502.668750 504.570750 uh we still find it fun
504.570750 510.994125 but
510.994125 512.673000 well am
512.673000 516.935125 i work in machine shop and do a lot of physical labor
516.935125 518.008250 [silence]
518.008250 520.130625 and so
520.130625 523.825750 [silence]
523.825750 525.153125 uh
525.153125 528.315125 yeah uh actually one of our
528.315125 530.576625 one of our favorites is a chain
530.576625 531.888375 Shoney's
531.888375 533.820875 [silence]
533.820875 536.160750 and in spite of the
536.160750 542.187000 [noise] and in spite of the fact i've spoken so badly about chains chain restaurants uh
542.187000 543.934125 [noise]
543.934125 547.664500 we uh do like Shoney's pretty well but then there's a
547.664500 548.765500 [silence]
548.765500 551.711875 place up the pass up in the mountains
551.711875 557.379125 that we pretty reliably like to go to on some Sunday mornings
557.379125 561.534625 drive drive up to i think it's about
561.534625 564.523625 eight thousand foot elevation and
564.523625 565.995000 and
565.995000 569.397250 and drive through Woodland Park and
569.397250 573.276375 go for a short drive in the mountains and have breakfast and
573.276375 575.055625 it it
575.055625 576.097375 [silence]
576.097375 578.476000 it's the way to spend a a nice Sunday morning
578.476000 581.225625 [silence]
581.225625 592.145625 i think it's as much the the trip to the mountains as it is the breakfast brunch you know [vocalized-noise] and it's not that far it's thirty miles
592.145625 593.765375 [silence]
593.765375 596.300625 the Colorado Springs what

50.340000 51.728625 um-hum
51.728625 56.495750 i think i agree with that very much i do you
56.495750 58.701250 [silence]
58.701250 64.342250 i do you think a lot of people when they are listening to a trial put themselves
64.342250 75.250000 in a position like that and say i would never do something like that and it's hard for them to believe that somebody else could do the things that have been done
75.250000 78.988250 [silence]
78.988250 81.262375 um-hum um-hum
81.262375 85.498125 [silence]
85.498125 87.997625 i never have either
87.997625 89.002250 uh-huh
89.002250 92.242125 uh is there a reason why you have never
92.242125 100.995375 uh-huh my husband works as a policeman so i always assumed that that was why i was never called uh-huh
100.995375 103.702250 [silence]
103.702250 104.995000 uh-huh
104.995000 110.490250 uh-huh uh do they have such a thing now as a six man jury
110.490250 118.983750 somebody told me the other day that there is wha[t]- what they call a six man jury and i had never heard of such thing and i wondered if it was true
118.983750 121.219000 [silence]
121.219000 132.981375 i never had either but i just wondered uh another question was uh should a criminal case uh should the jury be unanimous on their decision
132.981375 138.493875 and that i wasn't sure on either whether it should be unanimous or not
138.493875 148.970000 [silence]
148.970000 153.238875 that would mean they all would have to decide
153.238875 155.497250 one way or the other
155.497250 156.990500 uh-huh
156.990500 160.506500 [silence]
160.506500 161.704750 um-hum

170.977125 174.650875 um-hum um-hum um-hum
174.650875 180.984125 [silence]
180.984125 184.474500 bring some of these things out um-hum
184.474500 189.479000 [silence]
189.479000 198.495750 uh apparently there are i i i since my husband worked as a policeman i can't believe there are very many
198.495750 218.318500 people that come to trial that have are not guilty of something some part of whatever they're accused of i have i still have a little bit of a problem with that uh but i would suppose there are circumstances you're in the wrong place at the right time or know the per[son]- wrong person at the right time
218.318500 220.313500 um-hum
220.313500 234.506125 [silence]
234.506125 235.978000 um-hum
235.978000 239.649500 [silence]
239.649500 241.990750 ah um-hum

245.999375 248.478250 um-hum um-hum
248.478250 258.692250 [silence]
258.692250 261.485875 they still found him guilty
261.485875 264.493125 when people said he was at work
264.493125 266.495750 [silence]
266.495750 268.161500 uh-huh
268.161500 269.489250 well
269.489250 270.500625 [silence]
270.500625 271.972500 uh-huh
271.972500 273.495250 yeah
273.495250 276.791625 [silence]
276.791625 277.980750 uh-huh
277.980750 284.312375 [silence]
284.312375 289.776625 oh for heaven's sake so there's nine years of that man's life gone um-hum
289.776625 301.257500 no huh-uh yeah i guess that's where a lot of the problem lies we're we tr[y]- bend over backwards protecting the guilty people the one's that are on trial
301.257500 303.860000 and yeah
303.860000 308.776375 and we often forget about the one that the injustice has been done to
308.776375 314.474000 because i bet they still say our system is the best in the world
314.474000 320.239875 [silence]
320.239875 323.997875 yeah it's the best one that exists i guess so
323.997875 329.498375 [silence]
329.498375 331.290250 um-hum
331.290250 340.160750 [silence]
340.160750 348.492125 oh i think a lot of people are i think they've lost sight of some things that are very important to our country
348.492125 352.999875 [silence]
352.999875 354.488375 um-hum
354.488375 357.492625 yeah yeah
357.492625 360.282500 [silence]
360.282500 361.886750 um-hum
361.886750 366.488625 [silence]
366.488625 371.983125 [laughter] that bad huh [laughter] i wouldn't like it but i don't know if i'd go that far
371.983125 374.762125 [silence]
374.762125 376.496625 uh-huh
376.496625 378.260000 uh-huh
378.260000 382.981750 [silence]
382.981750 392.982875 yeah well i think pride in our country and our flag is i[s]- so important it's important in so many facets of our life
392.982875 403.779375 and uh i i- i feel like if they don't people don't like what our flag stands for they're welcome to go some place else e[xactly]-
403.779375 406.480000 there's nobody holding them here
406.480000 407.638875 [silence]
407.638875 411.137375 right they'd soon be back i'm sure
411.137375 412.488250 yeah
412.488250 417.996875 [silence]
417.996875 420.110875 um-hum
420.110875 427.259875 yeah i don't know about the judge making the decision if that's do you think that's good you know like if a jury
427.259875 428.997750 uh-huh
428.997750 434.993875 [silence]
434.993875 442.493375 make a recommendation do they sometimes make a recommendation that's what i was thinking they they sometimes do
442.493375 444.499500 [silence]
444.499500 447.264000 um um-hum
447.264000 451.446750 [silence]
451.446750 460.504875 and they recommend some yeah and then the judge has the final decision on what does really happen
460.504875 461.685375 yeah
461.685375 466.376500 [silence]
466.376500 468.484625 um-hum
468.484625 471.259000 [silence]
471.259000 485.993125 well i think that's where a lot of people think boy they're getting put away for a long time but actually their chance course when a lot of times when they come up for a parole they're denied it depends on you know what they're what they'd been guilty of and
485.993125 489.132000 and a lot of different things i guess
489.132000 491.774625 [silence]
491.774625 501.982875 um-hum a lot slip through the the protective whatever they have to do and and there are bad ones that do slip back out and
501.982875 505.259250 end up hurting somebody again
505.259250 507.998250 um-hum um-hum
507.998250 513.249125 [silence]
513.249125 514.743875 um-hum
514.743875 523.722500 um-hum i always thought there was there was wrong it seems sometimes that like somebody who is stealing a loaf of bread to feed his family
523.722500 535.498125 got more jail sentence than somebody maybe that killed somebody it seemed like there sometimes there's not a good the balance isn't right it doesn't make sense
535.498125 541.388750 [silence]
541.388750 544.489750 um-hum um-hum
544.489750 546.377500 [silence]
546.377500 548.798875 um-hum
548.798875 550.491875 yeah
550.491875 551.709750 [silence]
551.709750 552.498000 so
552.498000 556.367125 [silence]
556.367125 563.501625 yeah right so let's put up with it i guess improve it if we can if we ever get a chance so
563.501625 565.137750 so
565.137750 571.237125 well it's been nice talking to you Jack and uh i hope you have a real good day and week
571.237125 574.730875 [silence]
574.730875 581.462750 [laughter] i hope not [laughter] you too bye-bye
581.462750 583.279125 [noise]

0.000000 0.296500 [noise]
0.296500 1.696500 there you go
1.696500 9.499375 w[ell]- well Jean the subject is uh jury trials and should the jury recommend
9.499375 11.712500 uh sentencing
11.712500 14.478750 uh
14.478750 21.203875 now my personal opinion uh i don't know uh uh here lately it seems
21.203875 30.958250 well up until a few years ago i guess there there w[as]- uh there just too many liberals about and permitting too many
30.958250 39.947375 oh they just broaden the the human rights in to to cover just about e[verybody]- everybody and i don't think uh
39.947375 52.995250 those guilty of committing capital crimes should be uh permitted to go spend a few years in jail and be turned loose on parole it's just not right
52.995250 54.746250 [silence]
54.746250 59.474500 and therefore i think juries should be able to recommend sentencing
59.474500 74.302000 [silence]
74.302000 90.309125 uh yes very possibly so many of us have l[ed]- led sheltered lives that uh when we go into a sit in on a a a jury i've never done it myself unfortunately i wish i could have
90.309125 93.999375 i've just never been called up
93.999375 97.724875 [silence]
97.724875 100.266125 well now that's possible
100.266125 106.020500 but uh i was called up as an an alternate once but i never made it to the jury 
106.020500 109.719750 [silence]
109.719750 111.830375 not that i know of
111.830375 118.100625 [silence]
118.100625 119.987000 uh-huh
119.987000 122.985250 uh i've never heard of it
122.985250 137.459250 [silence]
137.459250 145.240875 [noise] uh well there again uh
145.240875 146.763375 [silence]
146.763375 149.268000 i suppose it should be
149.268000 152.723375 [silence]
152.723375 154.278375 e[xactly]- exactly
154.278375 163.996750 is it guilt or innocence but then again so many times uh you get one or two holdouts and and it permits the criminals to get a retrial
163.996750 165.025500 [silence]
165.025500 172.722750 and now tha[t]- that's not too bad in this sense because you might get someone in their that's a victim of circumstances i mean that's happened
172.722750 173.768250 [silence]
173.768250 182.482000 and uh giving them ano[ther]- a[nother]- another trial might give them additional time to uh prove their innocence
182.482000 190.497000 yes uh we can't overlook the fact that there are innocent people that do get involved in jury trials
190.497000 201.984625 [silence]
201.984625 203.985875 hum
203.985875 205.991875 um-hum
205.991875 215.477250 [silence]
215.477250 219.994500 oh that's it and you just might resemble somebody
219.994500 222.276125 uh
222.276125 225.778500 out here in Texas we had a a a a
225.778500 232.487625 great miscarriage of justice here it was finally after nine years it was finally uh
232.487625 246.998625 uh uh taken care of we had a a a black man was accused simply because he resembled uh someone who stuck who who held up a uh a a 7-Eleven i think it was 
246.998625 248.236750 [silence]
248.236750 258.697875 and even though he had witnesses that said that uh he was at work and he had all sorts of of a uh character witnesses and whatnot
258.697875 260.462000 th[ey]-
260.462000 262.699250 they found him guilty
262.699250 263.704875 [silence]
263.704875 272.999250 well they said it w[as]- that this happened during lunch time and he could have disapp[eared]- uh gotten away at lunch time and uh committed the robbery 
272.999250 284.998625 but after nine years well as a matter of fact they made a TV show about it after nine years they finally uh came up with evidence and prove[d]- to prove that he was innocent 
284.998625 287.483000 [silence]
287.483000 291.994125 exactly now that just was not fair
291.994125 293.696250 so
293.696250 299.997750 [silence]
299.997750 304.493500 yes unfortunately that's what happens
304.493500 314.489250 [silence]
314.489250 321.486625 well it's not the uh uh i[t's]- i[t's]- it's not the best system but it's the best one in the world
321.486625 322.653125 [silence]
322.653125 324.323875 uh-huh
324.323875 335.298500 and unfortunately we just have to put up with a lot of things and they they trying to solve them_1 and everything and but uh oh i don't know i think the Supreme Court
335.298500 341.249500 well i'm i'm i'm still rankled about their decision to permit burning of the flag 
341.249500 347.465125 [silence]
347.465125 356.473125 well it the the uh the first amendment definitely says freedom of speech not freedom of action
356.473125 363.615125 and uh uh oh that just rankles me no i swear if i ever saw somebody that 
363.615125 367.568625 uh b[urning]- burning a flag i'd i'd try to kill them_1 i would
367.568625 370.993625 [silence]
370.993625 377.652125 well i happen to be a flag freak i served i was in the service i was in Korea
377.652125 379.838875 and uh
379.838875 380.909625 [silence]
380.909625 384.649750 well i saw what the red in the flag represents
384.649750 391.725750 [silence]
391.725750 393.487250 um-hum
393.487250 401.984875 [silence]
401.984875 403.751875 yeah see what they
403.751875 405.737375 [silence]
405.737375 408.749375 see wh[at]- how they like it under another flag
408.749375 410.268125 [silence]
410.268125 411.993750 um-hum
411.993750 415.768375 well Jean we seem to be of of uh uh
415.768375 421.278625 the same uh uh opinions here i hope they get something out of this
421.278625 425.462000 [silence]
425.462000 430.492250 oh passing sentence well uh uh ye[s]-
430.492250 435.488125 yes but i i think the jury should be able to recommend
435.488125 437.308000 yes
437.308000 438.498750 [silence]

445.607875 446.826750 [silence]
446.826750 455.493250 but uh i know i'm always hearing that uh well the jury came in with a g[uilty]- guilty verdict and they recommended uh twenty years or something 
455.493250 456.994250 [silence]
456.994250 458.490500 yes
458.490500 460.735750 [silence]
460.735750 472.499625 of course uh now the jury may not be completely aware of all the ramifications of a sentence uh they may not know that if you give him twenty years he can get out in five
472.499625 481.993875 [silence]
481.993875 483.979875 um-hum

492.494125 503.497375 [silence]
503.497375 507.287250 yes they just go out and repeat their crimes
507.287250 516.400625 well there well they say a[fter]- after three offenses why it's automatically life in prison but i think they ought to make it two offenses
516.400625 527.535000 [silence]

551.481250 557.519125 but uh like you said it's uh i[t's]- i[t's]- it's not the best system but it's the best one we've got

571.490250 580.489500 well let's hope neither one of us ever have to run into th[is]- this uh with subject we've been discussing take care now bye
580.489500 583.279125 [noise]

0.000000 1.682750 are you a TIer 
1.682750 2.979250 oh good
2.979250 10.337250 yeah uh she had a hard time getting a few folks uh i thought well every all these TIers have gone home uh at one o'clock on Friday 
10.337250 12.273875 [laughter] 
12.273875 17.531750 [silence]
17.531750 23.051875 i i i do it a lot i have i kind of worked my way through college as a mechanic as a kid
23.051875 24.515875 uh
24.515875 34.158500 so and my father and brother were in it and and my brother's still in it and i had periods when i didn't do anything but in the last ten years i've 
34.158500 49.123250 uh my car doesn't go to a shop you know it it i just do it all do i uh there's hardly anything that other than putting tires on that i'll do i did take it to a transmission place to put in a new transmission but i change the oil and transmission and 
49.123250 54.127625 uh uh i just essentially do it all i don't know uh
54.127625 64.568125 uh if there's anything specific in fact i could advise people uh i happen to be a M E besides but i do it for fun really and to save money and i guess that's diversion uh 
64.568125 77.327375 i i've i've tried a few groups uh you know where you i can recommend it for people to take their cars Like i think Sears is probably the best place because i've heard when i used to go there
77.327375 84.989500 and when i i just overheard what they did for me very little because i didn't take it that much but what i heard them tell other people was always right
84.989500 88.650000 you know when i sat there i you know i dropped my car off for tires or something like that
88.650000 92.935125 and so i respect they seem to actually have mechanics there
92.935125 96.045875 i was pretty impressed with Western Auto
96.045875 107.451000 but they didn't do a great job of changing my transmission uh oil last time and when when i did it the next time i realized the filter was loose and everything and i didn't like it So i'm just doing it all myself i i 
107.451000 114.600875 [silence]
114.600875 116.683000 you had to do it yeah right 
116.683000 122.218250 [silence]

183.013625 186.006000 [silence]
186.006000 198.123500 yeah i wonder always wonder when you have little things like that happen why even here at TI why we don't inspect i'm in facilities why we don't inspect areas and and guarantee it so to speak uh 
198.123500 207.135250 we always fix things and [vocalized-noise] put things in and walk away we there needs to be a time of inspection and check out and and some thing like that with a car there ought to be someone there 
207.135250 221.095500 that inspects it before it's turned there ought to be an insp[ector]- inspector or quality insurance guy after after an oil change you know just in case uh they didn't put the oil in or whatever i i always wonder about that when when someone does repairs or little things like that uh 
221.095500 232.991250 [silence]
232.991250 234.277875 yeah

254.327625 257.062500 [silence]
257.062500 268.794250 you need to really uh i i do uh a lot of the simple things i i think i do most of the things better than the average person you you have Fords and i i uh i have three Chevys which
268.794250 280.567625 i worked my way into having the same engine i don't know how long i'm i like a V8 and i'm i'm s[old]- sold on small block Chevy V8s and i i bought one car new and i almost accidentally 
280.567625 285.139250 got the next car although i was kind of looking for it when i got a u[sed]- a used car with the same engine 
285.139250 297.277125 well then the nex[t]- the truck i got next i definitely looked for the same engine so i buy filters you know three or four at a time and essentially the engines are different you the cars are different years but the same Chevy V8 
297.277125 310.081875 and the part the carburetors is the same almost everything is the same the the course is two are eighties and one eighty six you know so you can learn a lot that way i there's no way i could i could fix every car in the world you know 
310.081875 314.646750 [silence]

425.484250 426.687750 [silence]
426.687750 437.405625 did you get it inside or outside i i took one off my little Buick i had and i pretty much took it loose on the inside but it came out from the you know underneath the hood it came from yeah 
437.405625 441.568125 [silence]
441.568125 445.814750 maybe you're right maybe you're right i it's been a long time since i took one out
445.814750 447.684375 [silence]
447.684375 448.769125 course
448.769125 454.295250 i broke mine you know so i'm always very careful when i change hoses on it i don't know whether you did yours
454.295250 458.133250 not to really pull on those i when i take those hoses i cut them off 
458.133250 468.040375 very gingerly because if you you know pull on that and i've always done that as a kid you know just yanked on it and they must have been stronger and heavier copper at the time 
468.040375 475.299500 but i broke one on my on my Buick and i always remembered it was my own fault and i thought well i'm going to to going to carefully take those hoses off 
475.299500 482.464625 [silence]
482.464625 484.153750 oh really yeah 
484.153750 487.614375 [silence]

505.468375 506.849500 yeah
506.849500 510.533500 sometimes if you're a tinkerer you luck out My wife's
510.533500 518.382125 uh Chevy uh it was a Caprice air conditioning stopped i i just heard it i realized that the air conditioning wasn't cutting in
518.382125 530.913125 and i went out there for five minutes and i just pushed on the wires And sure enough just pure dumb luck that the connection over by it's not the evaporator the big filter on one side
530.913125 533.605250 i just pushed that in and i heard it click
533.605250 545.318625 and so sometimes you have dumb luck i i was you know you could have taken something like that and thought well the compressor's not working or it would have taken me all day probably if i didn't do that but sometimes you have some dumb luck If you have a little curiosity 
545.318625 558.571625 and you have enough knowledge to check things out i know i feel bad for people who just when anything goes wrong a fuse you know they just have to take it And i know that's tough if you don't uh at least give it a shot i've got girls daughters and
558.571625 572.243250 i've always said i'd teach them And my my one daughter was fairly interested And i really haven't gotten around to i learned because i i just uh learned you know and i feel bad about not at least showing them some of the things And i'm going to do that i i told my daughters in college this year
572.243250 575.481000 i said This summer we're definitely going to spend a little more time on the car i said
575.481000 577.741625 so you can learn the basics you know 
577.741625 584.008250 [silence]

7.487375 18.934125 i uh it is Friday yeah that's for sure well uh i guess i'm trying to think the last thing i did to a car
18.934125 22.264250 [silence]
22.264250 24.479000 oh wow okay

101.589125 106.194000 [silence]
106.194000 118.719500 yeah that's that's the aggravating thing yeah i i try to do as much as i can i uh i grew up on farm so i've got that uh you know take care of yourself attitude and uh oh i've done
118.719500 129.845250 i've done various things i've got an i've got an eighty three T Bird and i've i've changed out uh heater core and uh oh timing belts and things like that um
129.845250 131.925625 um i guess the last thing i took
131.925625 144.715875 to anybody to have done was on my wife's car um when we went in for inspection it didn't it didn't quite pass so we had to have uh that's uh that's a Mustang with a two barrel carburetor on it
144.715875 154.957500 they had to do some adjustments on that and of course it had never been adjusted so they had to pull it off and pull all the plugs out to get to it and uh
154.957500 169.076000 yeah yeah i've uh i'm kind of stuck on them right now i guess but [laughter] you know that's it's partially because i can work on them that's uh that's that's that's a big part of my decision but uh yeah we ran into some problems with uh
169.076000 175.283750 having them to work on that carburetor i mean they get they got everything tuned up right you know but they we got i got it home and uh
175.283750 186.899500 and they had left the uh oil f[ilter]- uh cap off and it was rubbing on a belt and it rubbed a notch in that li[ttle]- little things like that that really start to aggravate you that that's a lot of the reason i do my own stuff
186.899500 196.894250 [silence]
196.894250 198.265250 um-hum
198.265250 210.886375 [silence]

211.952875 212.938375 [silence]
212.938375 214.655000 sure that's right
214.655000 215.667750 [silence]
215.667750 217.418625 sure yeah [vocalized-noise]
217.418625 220.354875 [silence]
220.354875 223.371625 any anything that gets that that's in uh
223.371625 238.054125 gets to be an an assembly line type operation you're you're always risking that if there's too many people that get their hands on one little project you know that things they're you get y[ou]- you miss that overlap sometimes and and they miss things yeah i've i've had a hard time
238.054125 241.071000 finding anybody i can trust like like you say it
241.071000 245.479000 my old transmissions things like that i'm obviously i'm not going to i'm not going to tear apart a
245.479000 247.795750 automatic transmission try rebuild it
247.795750 257.081875 but uh it it's it's real stressful to try to find anybody that i think's going to do me right and and uh you know have an idea of what's going on
257.081875 263.085625 [silence]
263.085625 264.069000 uh-huh
264.069000 268.010375 [silence]

304.281250 305.612125 uh-huh
305.612125 309.040875 [silence]
309.040875 317.859375 well yeah that that the biggest you know that's the three biggest things to me you know i- i number one you've got to have the tools around if you don't have the the special tools or
317.859375 326.377750 well any more the the testers that you know [laughter] i i don't have a forty thousand dollar diagnostic tester sitting in my garage you know so obviously if it starts
326.377750 338.713875 my car start missing or something like that th[at]- it's almost impossible to track that down any more without a diagnostics but at the tools and the space to do it that that can be a big problem if it's if it's under carriage or something like that but
338.713875 347.278750 then it's experience you know you can you can look through a a Chilton's book or something like and get an idea of how to go about it but
347.278750 351.618750 you better figure on multiplying that time out about by at least by five or so
351.618750 358.082625 ju[st]- just just by not knowing you know how to get to that that one bolt or that one screw or whatever to get things apart
358.082625 362.911125 that was that was the biggest thing when i did uh the heater core in my T Bird
362.911125 369.727375 that is got to be the worst location for it and and the only reason i did it i [vocalized-noise]
369.727375 380.890250 yeah yeah the the only ones i've ever heard good good things about are are the old Lincolns and Cadillacs where they had the little door underneath the hood You just open the door and pop it out yeah but but uh
380.890250 386.661000 i- i had i had taken this in to have it done originally and uh
386.661000 393.509750 oh it it was it was tremend[ous]- well it was about seven hours labor so it it was going to run about four hundred dollars or so
393.509750 397.526750 and they looked it over and they they
397.526750 401.210000 they thought they could patch it up a little bit you know and what not so they
401.210000 403.356750 [silence]
403.356750 410.891250 yeah ye[ah]- yeah and it was it was leaking inside the car in the condenser unit so uh they they did a little patch on it
410.891250 422.389750 and it l[ast]- it held for about four to six months and i finally went back in and started looking at it myself and i[t]- it's a matter of tearing all the dash out and all that kind of stuff but hey it was not
422.389750 428.674750 uh it was not a seven hour labor job for me it was about a week before i finally through
428.674750 434.994625 [silence]
434.994625 443.174250 yeah oh really no this this was the only thing that sticks in inside the engine compartment on this are the two uh hose fittings
443.174250 444.961250 [silence]
444.961250 448.535875 yeah it it's i i've never heard a good story about uh
448.535875 452.541250 [silence]
452.541250 453.924875 yeah

468.359125 474.477500 [silence]
474.477500 480.833875 you bet well that that's what ended up being the real problem on this was the uh it the the pipe wasn't busted
480.833875 486.063000 but the it wasn't soldered in good enough and it had it had broken loose enough to where
486.063000 487.639000 if it got hot
487.639000 495.675875 and and n[ot]- just normal driving didn't do it but if if if it was an especially hot day the pressure would get high enough and it would start blowing the water out inside 
495.675875 498.742875 it was real aggravating but uh i i couldn't
498.742875 507.330250 eve[n]- even a week's a week's time is is worth a whole lot less than four than four hundred dollars to me you know than to have somebody else do it
507.330250 509.043250 [silence]
509.043250 510.364625 uh-huh

58.057750 62.069875 [silence]
62.069875 68.426125 the one it's kind of like uh automobile insurance the ones uh that i think are the highest and important to me 
68.426125 72.834125 uh i hope i never have to use them really per se although i've used medical a little bit uh
72.834125 81.872625 that well that one certainly is high i i worry that it's weakening rather than strengthening so i like to reverse that trend and say i'd like to get those to strengthen you know be better and better
81.872625 88.643375 then sal[ary]- sal[ary]- salary continuance i've never used that one i hope i never will but that's kind of like an insurance thing i sure like that one
88.643375 89.939250 [silence]
89.939250 94.069250 that's like automobile insurance you never want to get in an accident but it you like to have it there

155.841750 159.022750 and outside consultants didn't they have an outside consultant too
159.022750 161.552625 did they have an outside consultant like a
161.552625 162.920625 the employ[ee]-
162.920625 164.704875 [silence]
164.704875 166.023500 yeah

187.683125 195.124750 [silence]
195.124750 203.450000 yeah they seem to be do[ing]- doing a good job of that i'm in facilities an[d]- and our organization built builds those facilities over in Park Central now
203.450000 207.781500 and i guess they've been using them for six months now and i've known several engineers that got laid off and they said
207.781500 218.617500 it's like getting a PhD almost they the much they learn over there you know after they've been laid off uh one engineer said it was really an education he he just learned like you he said
218.617500 223.604000 he learned a tremendous amount that he never would have able to pick up on his own he was very thankful for that too
223.604000 228.462875 [silence]
228.462875 230.255500 to have an office yeah
230.255500 231.317875 [silence]
231.317875 241.579375 yeah well he said he learned so much and how he thought he thought he had a PhD in how to get a job after he was through the whole process for for several months he did eventually get a job
241.579375 245.587375 [silence]
245.587375 250.457375 yeah apparently it's very sophisticated and i guess it may be one of the best uh that anyone's doing
250.457375 257.017750 [silence]
257.017750 259.790875 right you're absolutely right that's a good one
259.790875 262.479000 what do you think about pensions anything on that or
262.479000 265.993250 [silence]
265.993250 267.276000 yeah
267.276000 271.872750 [silence]
271.872750 273.170875 um-hum
273.170875 274.806625 [silence]
274.806625 276.171125 right
276.171125 277.188750 [silence]
277.188750 286.090000 what do you think of a pension that goes from one company to the other like an account like a 401[K]- account i i've been thinking about that for years uh
286.090000 297.333000 i know that's what i'm saying that that pensions you see just like you were you're saying you've only got uh so many years say you work for two three companies if you take your pension with you after you're vested
297.333000 301.610625 and then just add the money together like you do with a 401[K]- account you know
301.610625 307.026250 uh it's your account period it doesn't matter where you go or anything that's your account to roll over
307.026250 308.133000 [silence]
308.133000 317.981000 no no there isn't i i'm saying that's the question what do you think could be better and i'm saying that pensions say in the year two thousand or more when social security goes away which it probably will
317.981000 323.233125 i think they ought to have a pension at least that you'd never lose you work for a company seven years
323.233125 325.736875 [silence]
325.736875 335.003750 uh well social security's going to go to way i think and you can or you can invest your own money you have no control over your social security and it's not paid for by the current
335.003750 338.996625 like when say we retire after the year two thousand
338.996625 342.856000 social security's paid for by the twenty five year olds you know they may rebel
342.856000 351.245375 and you won't have any social security where if your money was in your account i mean you can never lose it it's there you don't have to depend on anybody to be putting that money in for you you know
351.245375 352.830250 that's just a thought i mean i
352.830250 354.314750 if they say which
354.314750 355.511375 yeah
355.511375 356.930250 [silence]
356.930250 365.622875 yeah and instead of having a a socialized pension it just would be really money that you and your company maybe you had to put some money in it too i don't really know
365.622875 369.082250 but i i can see where they'd need to do something on that because
369.082250 373.931750 the statistics are you don't work for a company twenty years through no fault of your own you know
373.931750 378.158625 you work for five six seven and y[ou]- y[ou]- a lot of people i know guys
378.158625 380.735625 [silence]
380.735625 386.703625 yeah i have too but not not quite that often but uh yeah i've only got uh
386.703625 391.230625 i've got fourteen now here at TI and i hope to make twenty five but say if something happened to me i mean
391.230625 397.685625 you know they lay me off uh you have a pension but then you'd have to try to get a pension in another one it would be nice if they could get them together
397.685625 400.879500 i do worry about medical though again knock wood that uh
400.879500 409.367750 i haven't used it i guess you i'm sorry you really do use it throughout the year because you get your teeth fixed and all that i mean i but i'm not i'm talking about major items i haven't used it for anything major
409.367750 411.049750 i'm glad it's there though
411.049750 420.324125 [silence]
420.324125 421.567000 yeah
421.567000 423.386875 [silence]
423.386875 431.666750 i have the regular i again i ju[st]- i haven't i can't complain about it because i haven't used it and every time i needed it it it [vocalized-noise] it's uh you know
431.666750 437.338125 fallen right in line for the the minor things i guess i'm the one just supporting most of the others
437.338125 441.959375 [silence]
441.959375 449.615875 uh yeah yeah i think it's two seventy five for a family but the dental is right away if you exams uh
449.615875 454.054250 okay yeah the medical you have to have a deductible
454.054250 455.573750 [silence]
455.573750 457.230500 yeah right
457.230500 461.162125 [silence]
461.162125 464.512375 well drugs are okay now i'm on that uh
464.512375 474.503250 plan where i take blood pressure medicine if you take an allergy medicine so anything you need a prescription for for more than six months you get it for used to be six bucks they just raised it to twelve
474.503250 476.665750 [silence]
476.665750 479.257000 yeah that's a typical that's a typical one that's in there
479.257000 481.701875 the forms are right in personnel
481.701875 485.841125 fact you may be able to take care of take advantage of that it's through Baxter Labs
485.841125 486.857250 [silence]
486.857250 488.481750 uh
488.481750 490.028125 [silence]
490.028125 493.643000 well maybe you still can do that do you do you buy your pills one at a time
493.643000 494.773750 [silence]
494.773750 500.947250 well turn turn in your forms go right to personnel i don't know whether you have to about an HMO i don't think so
500.947250 504.960375 you turn you get your doctor to give you a more than six months prescription
504.960375 510.411500 and uh they're twelve dollars again they just were six they just raised them to twelve this year
510.411500 512.869750 twelve dollars for a three months supply
512.869750 517.495375 or whatever whatever the the amount is uh i don't want to say three months but
517.495375 524.832625 it's a lot cheaper allergy medicine's really uh expensive and that blood pressure medicine is fairly expensive i take two
524.832625 525.835875 [silence]
525.835875 531.719250 go right to personnel they got the forms in personnel and maybe i maybe i've told you go something you didn't know about in benefits [laughter-there]
531.719250 534.629125 i do it yeah i you know it's a very common thing
534.629125 538.030125 it's through Baxter Labs tell yeah
538.030125 539.502000 yeah
539.502000 542.999000 what else i'm sure we're getting close to our five minutes whatever here
542.999000 548.966375 [silence]
548.966375 550.466000 what other benefits
550.466000 551.539625 [silence]
551.539625 558.424375 yeah the salary continuation i think that's a great one but again a hope i never use that one that means you're really sick if you have to use that one
558.424375 559.722375 [silence]
559.722375 565.586375 i'm satisfied with the vacation i don't know what else you know you nice to say you get another week
565.586375 571.532375 and when i'm well i only got fourteen years so i'll get another week when i hit fifteen 
571.532375 573.191500 [silence]
573.191500 578.356750 so that's that's fair i mean it's reasonable if four weeks is a lot i think 
578.356750 582.950250 i know some people who have twenty five years and thirty and they want more but uh you know 
582.950250 584.497875 uh
584.497875 590.332625 [silence]
590.332625 591.638000 um-hum 
591.638000 592.652000 [silence]
592.652000 600.040500 well the way things go i think i'm going to have to work till i'm seventy five whether i quit and uh uh or when i retire get a part-time job 

0.000000 2.495375 [silence]

36.516750 39.881125 yeah uh well i'll tell you i've
39.881125 47.826000 been around for quite a few years and worked for a lot of different companies and uh it's hard to beat any of the benefits that or salaries either 
47.826000 51.353625 that we get from TI i'm quite pleased with it 
51.353625 57.714750 course there's a few things that uh i think i could do better if i was sitting up in the CEO's seat but um 
57.714750 58.769250 [silence]
58.769250 62.086000 i think Jerry's doing a pretty good job as it goes

108.286750 112.453000 uh i wasn't with GSI but i was connected with uh 
112.453000 113.872125 uh oil

118.587500 121.071000 but i say i wasn't connected with GSI

122.148000 126.761625 and i got caught up in a layoff now
126.761625 130.143000 uh course you get six months 
130.143000 132.388375 uh unemployment from the state 
132.388375 133.394125 [silence]
133.394125 138.579375 but what TI did for us is is uh i i've never heard of it before 
138.579375 144.254875 they fixed us up with an office with uh telephones access to long distance 
144.254875 146.623625 uh computers
146.623625 151.493750 a secretary to take messages for us or type uh letters for us 
151.493750 154.973750 uh they had out of town newspapers
154.973750 157.341750 and then the co[mpany]- 
157.341750 158.638000 [silence]

159.666750 161.429500 [silence]
161.429500 165.914000 uh yes they they did have uh seminars every once in a while 
165.914000 171.295375 uh cause that was not uh restricted just to just us 
171.295375 175.151750 but the most important thing was that uh they had 
175.151750 178.547375 made up the difference between
178.547375 183.967500 uh unemployment pay and seventy five percent of my net pay 
183.967500 186.649625 and they then TI paid me that 
186.649625 195.471375 so uh i was able to uh not just exist i mean i i lived just as comfortably as i did before i was laid off 
195.471375 202.668250 [silence]

53.509500 57.491250 um i believe in it too [laughter]
57.491250 70.033875 uh i'm Catholic and we're not supposed to but uh i feel that it like you you know on the premeditated murders i feel if you're you know i mean if it's beyond a doubt that you did it
70.033875 75.010000 you know i would say go ahead and execute that person as well
75.010000 84.048750 but it's the cases you know like sometimes you you know you hear of people that they say they went to jail falsely you know they really didn't do it well you know
84.048750 90.645500 you you got you got that point well h[ow]- you know what what if a mistake is made and you put someone
90.645500 93.087500 you know to death that really didn't do it
93.087500 94.346500 [silence]
94.346500 97.114375 there's always that chance i don't know but
97.114375 105.642000 i would say that you know for that many people to all of them agree that you did it and it was premeditated it would be kind of hard for you know
105.642000 107.356750 you know what i'm saying like
107.356750 108.909625 [silence]
108.909625 110.504875 yeah
110.504875 112.914750 so uh i

122.923875 124.499250 uh-huh
124.499250 125.718375 [silence]
125.718375 127.115250 exactly
127.115250 140.875375 uh i'm not sure about Pennsylvania whether we have it or not for some reason i was thinking that we do but it's you know it's not very often i think maybe last year was the first time in like eighteen years or something like that
140.875375 142.645625 that anyone
142.645625 148.915750 anyone from Pennsylvania had gotten it i don't do you know if Virginia has it
148.915750 151.336375 [silence]
151.336375 152.888875 uh-huh
152.888875 155.439500 i know Florida has it
155.439500 157.788000 [silence]
157.788000 159.118375 [laughter]
159.118375 161.605750 [silence]

168.245375 169.653750 uh you know
169.653750 175.590500 [silence]
175.590500 178.804875 yeah but it's funny that uh i mean
178.804875 185.490000 like you know like i said i think last year was the first time in like eighteen years for Pennsylvania i'm not even sure of that but for some reason
185.490000 194.849875 i think that you know it was something like that and it surprised and even Florida i know they have it and you don't really hear about it real often how many people
194.849875 198.537625 [silence]
198.537625 203.571875 yeah but you you think that i mean if you think of how many premeditated murders are committed
203.571875 209.354250 you know compared to that and to how many people are being sent that doesn't seem like very many
209.354250 216.522000 [silence]
216.522000 217.752250 yeah
217.752250 220.385875 everyone would appeal
220.385875 222.336250 that's true too
222.336250 224.669125 [silence]
224.669125 226.294875 uh-huh

253.315375 259.530250 [silence]
259.530250 262.661250 yeah uh-huh and then they get out
262.661250 266.821250 yeah they get out in three years on probation and they do it again you know
266.821250 269.783125 it's like a slap on the fingers for them
269.783125 271.640500 i don't i don't
271.640500 286.197875 uh i- i don't i think that it should be i mean if it's beyond a doubt that someone did premeditate someone a murder then i think you know that they should likewise you know someone should take their life also but uh
286.197875 287.418375 [silence]
287.418375 292.508000 but are are you would you draw the line there with just the premeditated murder
292.508000 293.707000 [silence]
293.707000 294.949125 yeah
294.949125 303.172750 [silence]

331.735375 334.011750 i think some of them would rather be in jail [laughter]
334.011750 335.266375 [silence]
335.266375 339.016500 yeah they probably have it better in jail than what they would out in the streets
339.016500 341.792625 [silence]
341.792625 346.058500 i don't know uh i was just going to say something i forgot what it was

536.963625 545.784875 that's something you know [laughter-i] [laughter-mean] but uh [laughter] wh[ether]- whether they plea bargain or not if they're guilty of murder they're guilty of murder you know
545.784875 549.381750 so i don't think that they deserve anything less [laughter]
549.381750 551.788250 it's just i don't i don't know i just
551.788250 553.744625 [laughter]

4.167250 18.121000 well uh anyways i'm not exactly sure i i wasn't really uh paying attention as to what particular uh parts of capital punishment we're supposed to talk about but it was uh basically what's your views on whether you thought there was certain cases that should be used that sort of thing
18.121000 20.380500 right and uh
20.380500 24.805875 i don't know i've i've always thought that any uh crime that uh
24.805875 31.172500 that uh intentionally where someone goes out and premeditatively takes another life
31.172500 43.532125 would be the ones where i think that capital punishment would be necessary to keep that person from perhaps uh doing it again and even more so to get people on the outside who are professionals to realize that
43.532125 47.966125 you know there's a a very steep penalty to uh be paid
47.966125 49.704250 when that's done
49.704250 51.077500 and uh
51.077500 52.633125 [silence]
52.633125 54.188750 yeah how do you feel about it
54.188750 57.081000 [silence]
57.081000 58.102500 uh-huh
58.102500 70.678875 [silence]
70.678875 71.540125 uh-huh
71.540125 74.935250 [silence]
74.935250 76.033125 uh-huh
76.033125 92.893375 [silence]
92.893375 95.344000 right exactly
95.344000 105.256750 [silence]
105.256750 106.187375 uh-huh
106.187375 110.025625 right if if the [vocalized-noise] evidence wasn't overwhelming right
110.025625 111.101625 uh-huh
111.101625 111.956625 [silence]
111.956625 116.914625 well i think that should be likewise decided by the jury you know because
116.914625 127.313625 i don't know [noise] i think a jury would be less likely to just send a man to death just for any reason [noise] i don't know a judge might be a little more cold-blooded about it [noise]
127.313625 140.857250 [silence]
140.857250 143.035875 [noise] yeah i don't think we
143.035875 148.304000 [silence]
148.304000 149.938750 no huh-uh
149.938750 151.974375 no we don't
151.974375 153.348500 yeah
153.348500 155.418000 [silence]
155.418000 156.411250 uh-huh
156.411250 163.376750 oh yeah [laughter] they're always doing it in Florida Florida and Louisiana i think and uh some of the other southern states
163.376750 164.396250 [silence]
164.396250 176.301875 of course they have such a crime problem because they have such a un[employment]- unemployment rate [noise] you get that unemployment way up so then people you know tend towards crime and then they [noise] they start stiffening the penalties
176.301875 194.884250 [silence]
194.884250 199.834000 well in Florida seems like uh two or three times a year it's constantly on the
199.834000 204.130000 [noise]
204.130000 204.623125 yeah
204.623125 208.840250 [silence]
208.840250 216.801625 no that's true course they have a requirement that uh that every single appeal must be permitted
216.801625 220.936500 so of course the the attorneys take them through the whole chain
220.936500 224.846750 you know even if the case is open and closed they go all the way up to the Supreme Court you know
224.846750 225.949750 [silence]
225.949750 234.133250 they almost always get thrown right back out again but they have to have every single appeal made open to them
234.133250 237.196000 and you know it's sort of strange because it almost
237.196000 238.466625 [silence]
238.466625 244.548375 it almost seems like the attorneys are doing it for the money or something because i mean the guy knows that
244.548375 245.801125 whether it's
245.801125 251.947000 you know a a month or two or six years he's still going to get you know the chair when it comes around [laughter]
251.947000 253.013375 you know
253.013375 254.685000 some of these guys are
254.685000 256.370375 really uh
256.370375 260.743500 you know violent Son of Sam killers and stuff like that you know
260.743500 264.230375 i mean they everyone knows they're going get not going to get out
264.230375 265.259375 [silence]
265.259375 266.681000 yeah
266.681000 268.171750 uh-huh
268.171750 269.839500 [silence]
269.839500 270.614375 uh-huh
270.614375 292.786625 [silence]
292.786625 304.054750 i think so uh a lot of the the the other violent crimes i don't really feel that strongly about although you know stiffer sentences and lessening the effects of parole i mean
304.054750 314.958875 these guys are certainly not going to uh be they can't i mean they're getting into drugs and fights and all that stuff in prison i don't think the parole system is really helping that [laughter-much]
314.958875 318.384000 reduce the violence in the prisons i think that's its only purpose
318.384000 319.149625 is
319.149625 326.576750 is you know to reduce uh the violence in the prisons so people behave themselves a little bit better if they think they're going to get off early
326.576750 330.680000 off earlier but some of these guys just don't care you know
330.680000 332.227375 and so uh
332.227375 334.085250 [silence]
334.085250 336.432875 yeah right uh-huh
336.432875 339.476500 [silence]
339.476500 341.610250 um that's possible i guess
341.610250 350.341625 [silence]
350.341625 352.666500 um so where do you live in Pennsylvania
352.666500 357.489125 [silence]
357.489125 360.575875 oh okay [noise] i don't think i really know that
360.575875 361.957500 [silence]
361.957500 372.431125 because uh you know that all depends too on where you are at that's uh sort of interesting to get opinions as to where different parts of the country are because_1 the more grass root country uh parts of the country tend to
372.431125 382.768375 to support capital punishment where the places that are you know less in contact with crime you know the the more more urban i mean less
382.768375 392.152375 [silence]
392.152375 393.167500 uh-huh
393.167500 404.791125 [silence]
404.791125 406.596000 two hours where
406.596000 408.380250 oh okay near Polk
408.380250 410.169875 [silence]
410.169875 411.328375 Polk Institute
411.328375 412.386250 [silence]
412.386250 418.856125 it's uh an old uh university that turned into a place for the mentally retarded uh
418.856125 420.128000 [silence]
420.128000 423.071250 very old uh historical place there
423.071250 425.811250 Sharon Pennsylvania's up there
425.811250 427.247500 yeah
427.247500 428.589000 [silence]
428.589000 430.049500 oh okay
430.049500 445.748875 [silence]
445.748875 448.052875 in that case maybe you know
448.052875 465.628125 [silence]
465.628125 466.972000 right
466.972000 475.003625 that's true yeah well it it you know you get certain circumstances where you hear about these people that have you know stolen kids and
475.003625 478.636125 you know done terrible things to them and killed them and you know that sort of thing
478.636125 485.122250 you just like i don't want that person sharing the Earth with me you know i mean that is just terrible
485.122250 492.524750 and uh you know we had a case like that here and on the other hand you know people are saying that because the
492.524750 503.466875 he knows because the criminals know that the uh penalties can be very severe they uh there's less criminals that are you know turning themselves in or you know
503.466875 505.688875 pleading or whatever
505.688875 513.300000 because they know that the judge you know if they find them guilty is you know has the the opportunity to sentence them you know for for the death sentence
513.300000 516.744125 [silence]
516.744125 528.978875 yeah well i'm just saying that that that's what the the client lawyers are saying they're saying that you know you know more of my clients would have pleaded guilty if they would have gotten a light sentence instead of possibly having to
528.978875 535.948500 to to get a death sentence because you can't plea bargain what the sentence is going to be you can plea bargain what you're guilty of but
535.948500 537.146125 you know
537.146125 539.480000 but not how they're going to sentence it
539.480000 545.171125 [silence]
545.171125 546.883625 right uh-huh
546.883625 548.354000 [silence]
548.354000 549.926375 yeah right
549.926375 551.933000 [silence]
551.933000 557.452250 uh-huh i was just saying that way what they're saying is that they can't get people to turn themselves in then
557.452250 565.287250 and so we have to go through a trial then to prove the person's guilty and perhaps we can and perhaps we can't and so the guy might get off
565.287250 567.436125 [laughter] and uh
567.436125 573.443250 although usually the guys that are turning themselves in are are guys that are you know going to get caught anyways but
573.443250 577.419750 there's always a few of those people that are you know lost their head or whatever
577.419750 578.715625 [silence]
578.715625 580.062250 anyways
580.062250 581.385750 but uh
581.385750 589.709250 yeah we just had a terrible case in Virginia where some girl disappeared and and the guy like i said he just uh
589.709250 598.768000 said that he took her but he won't admit that she died or whatever and he won't say where the body is because he knows the penalty's very s[evere]- s[evere]- you know mandatory life sentences for murder

0.000000 1.024375 [noise]
1.024375 4.416000 so child care your views
4.416000 35.276250 [silence]
35.276250 36.989500 and what religious faith
36.989500 38.052750 [silence]
38.052750 39.302250 oh
39.302250 40.508500 [silence]
40.508500 42.437000 that's that's good
42.437000 53.069375 [silence]
53.069375 58.721000 uh they do seem to be at the outside edge of both extremes don't they
58.721000 64.780250 [silence]
64.780250 67.483375 and whenever
67.483375 69.491750 they are they seem to
69.491750 71.120000 [silence]
71.120000 75.964000 regulate the good toward the bad instead of bad toward the good
75.964000 82.870375 [silence]
82.870375 84.511125 better situations
84.511125 93.740125 [silence]
93.740125 98.038875 yeah yeah that's that's very well phrased uh
98.038875 99.330000 [silence]
99.330000 102.025875 so have you ever used outside child care
102.025875 106.930375 [silence]
106.930375 109.122125 real day care
109.122125 110.723000 [silence]
110.723000 112.198625 uh
112.198625 113.998250 [silence]
113.998250 117.025500 our step daughter's ten now
117.025500 118.374375 [silence]
118.374375 119.799875 and
119.799875 124.387875 most of the day care has been provide for by Grandma
124.387875 127.007375 [silence]
127.007375 128.447250 but
128.447250 131.550625 quite honestly what i believe to be
131.550625 137.835375 the best day care situation was while we lived up the pass of Woodland Park
137.835375 139.799500 [silence]
139.799500 141.579875 there was uh
141.579875 142.734625 [silence]
142.734625 146.481375 ex school teacher that uh
146.481375 147.938500 did
147.938500 150.876375 a small amount of before school and
150.876375 155.627875 and after school you know kindergartners or half-dayers
155.627875 157.351250 in her home
157.351250 159.018375 [silence]
159.018375 161.588500 and they would read and play
161.588500 162.618375 [silence]
162.618375 163.876125 seem to be
163.876125 170.802625 [silence]
170.802625 173.389250 uh yeah and uh
173.389250 174.934750 despite
174.934750 178.123750 our beliefs
178.123750 180.084750 she was uh
180.084750 181.276000 [silence]
181.276000 183.432625 one of the more um
183.432625 185.272875 [silence]
185.272875 188.450000 charismatic Christian faiths
188.450000 189.517750 [silence]
189.517750 191.515625 and it worked out wonderfully
191.515625 208.597000 [silence]
208.597000 211.705000 uh yeah but i don't know that it would be state approved
211.705000 243.215625 [silence]
243.215625 244.188875 i
244.188875 247.396000 now i don't know what the current Texas laws are
247.396000 248.741625 but i
248.741625 249.750500 [silence]
249.750500 253.117000 but i do know that the license doesn't seem to
253.117000 256.524750 [silence]
256.524750 258.569250 guarantee quality
258.569250 266.401500 [silence]
266.401500 267.941125 uh
267.941125 270.906000 now here i believe that
270.906000 272.636875 child care
272.636875 274.751125 [silence]
274.751125 278.987625 meets by in large certain standards for
278.987625 280.080000 [silence]
280.080000 281.724250 uh
281.724250 285.348500 balanced food if they provide food

292.826625 295.116250 levels of supervision
295.116250 296.201500 [silence]
296.201500 299.643375 levels being defined as
299.643375 303.903375 number of of working adults for

327.351750 329.081750 yeah uh
329.081750 332.349375 my wife is uh agnostic
332.349375 334.386500 and i'm a

341.271625 344.722875 [silence]
344.722875 346.062750 yet
346.062750 349.071500 i really believe that this
349.071500 350.598750 charismatic
350.598750 352.370375 [silence]
352.370375 353.716000 care
353.716000 355.121125 [silence]
355.121125 358.374375 or the charismatic belief when emphasized on care
358.374375 360.669875 [silence]
360.669875 363.162250 or semi charismatic i might say
363.162250 364.873125 [silence]
364.873125 366.229125 was quite good
366.229125 368.613875 [silence]
368.613875 370.251750 yes very
370.251750 371.330375 [silence]

375.054875 376.041750 uh
376.041750 379.952750 [silence]
379.952750 386.663125 the care is what i guess you should emphasize in the term child care instead of the child
386.663125 399.091000 [silence]
399.091000 401.270875 and not have any care
401.270875 405.677500 [silence]
405.677500 408.285875 and i'm not sure that really
408.285875 410.487500 [silence]
410.487500 414.052625 child care per se should instill
414.052625 415.373375 any
415.373375 417.211500 [silence]
417.211500 419.995375 education per se
419.995375 421.777750 you know what i'm saying
421.777750 441.901250 [silence]
441.901250 443.326250 proper interface
443.326250 444.479750 [silence]
444.479750 448.120875 it's just just correctness of of
448.120875 449.793375 [silence]
449.793375 452.038125 social skills if you will
452.038125 493.280250 [silence]
493.280250 495.125500 uh yeah uh
495.125500 496.419625 [silence]
496.419625 498.467250 it's a very broad issue
498.467250 499.639625 [silence]
499.639625 500.581250 and
500.581250 503.124625 [silence]
503.124625 507.840125 you know it's a shame but most people doing child care
507.840125 509.997000 earn almost no money

582.230375 583.238750 [silence]
583.238750 584.081000 but
584.081000 585.101125 [silence]
585.101125 586.685375 more and more
586.685375 593.865750 we're being forced into a situation we as Americans are being forced into a situation
593.865750 595.095375 [silence]
595.095375 596.043125 where
596.043125 597.833750 [silence]

0.000000 4.325875 [silence]
4.325875 11.254125 uh well we only have one child right now and another one on the way and right now i'm i'm home with her during the day
11.254125 18.848625 i if i was looking for outside care i probably would stay away from professional child care centers
18.848625 31.382875 and try to find if i was close to home relatives or people with the same values and possibly religious faith or something similar so that she would be raised in an environment that would be
31.382875 35.100875 similar to what we would have in our own homes as as parents
35.100875 36.567500 [silence]

40.547500 43.337625 [silence]
43.337625 44.975000 that's what i would try to do
44.975000 53.460625 with a teaching background i've um had a little bit of experience with the child day care type situations but i've seen some good ones and i've seen some really bad ones
53.460625 58.288625 [silence]
58.288625 64.530875 uh-huh and everything in between yeah in most states there's nothing to regulate them
64.530875 66.278750 and so
66.278750 75.516375 [silence]
75.516375 81.553000 right by trying to get them to conform to concern standards they uh kind of uh eliminate a lot of the
81.553000 82.725625 uh
82.725625 83.844875 [silence]
83.844875 87.546625 yeah the the uh what am i trying to think of tha[t]-
87.546625 88.865125 [silence]
88.865125 93.934125 not the imagination but the creativity in in the situation and so

96.419875 97.975250 [laughter]
97.975250 101.616125 [silence]

137.369375 138.651500 uh-huh
138.651500 155.062875 [silence]
155.062875 155.972375 uh-huh
155.972375 162.463750 [silence]
162.463750 165.472375 have a relative struct[ured]- a structured
165.472375 170.328750 activities and not just you know stick them in a corner and say you're on your own
170.328750 187.623875 [silence]
187.623875 188.775625 uh-huh
188.775625 190.856875 [silence]
190.856875 194.800250 yeah i know that um that
194.800250 199.427375 i guess if you have the opportunity to pick and choose and you've got the time and that uh
199.427375 208.333875 i don't know if the resources are the proper term you know just the the know knowledge of who's a available then you could probably find some really good care
208.333875 211.391250 [silence]
211.391250 216.827625 that's true you can get somebody somebody willing to babysit but actual
216.827625 220.381125 you know that's sometimes different on a done on a different scale
220.381125 226.180125 i have even considered you know babysitting myself i have a teaching degree and uh
226.180125 230.740250 thought well you know i could structure and then for one reason or other decided not to
230.740250 236.390125 but i think if you take more than three children in well that was how it was this Virginia we've recently moved here to Texas
236.390125 242.801000 but in Virginia i think if you take more than three children in on more than a several hours a day bases you have to be licensed
242.801000 258.900625 [silence]
258.900625 267.735375 yeah a lot of times you might just need to go now and feel file for it just like a business you may not have to prove any type of qualification for it i don't
267.735375 294.769750 [silence]
294.769750 295.688625 uh-huh

308.219500 311.297875 [silence]
311.297875 316.203000 that's uh kind of a minimum there that you're getting your covering basic care there and not
316.203000 319.545375 all the extras that most people would like to see
319.545375 325.232125 done with there children you know like the educational activities the supervised play and
325.232125 326.626500 so forth

371.276625 386.239750 [silence]
386.239750 387.506750 uh-huh
387.506750 392.062375 yeah a little bit of love and and attention is what most of them need
392.062375 393.058250 [silence]
393.058250 394.812000 you know even if it's
394.812000 399.503500 not a real educated program you can have good educational program and and
399.503500 400.506125 [silence]
400.506125 405.577500 right and and that's not certainly what you want for your child or what you would give your child yourself
405.577500 407.244875 so
407.244875 421.403625 [silence]
421.403625 435.154000 well even educated play uh supervised play can teach without and i'm not saying talking about sitting down and teaching them math or or or something like that but just kind of promoting social skills and uh
435.154000 444.141000 you know like my my child that she want be an only child for long but you know she was an only child or maybe your daughter not having yeah
444.141000 445.461500 yeah just
445.461500 451.233000 [silence]
451.233000 455.527000 uh-huh right those basic things that uh they would
455.527000 456.535500 [silence]
456.535500 459.905875 that you know maybe a little bit of uh
459.905875 466.483625 i don't know if manners is a is a good term or not but you know dealing with other through uh
466.483625 473.317250 proper mannerisms and politeness and so forth you know that sort of thing you'd want your child to learn that
473.317250 482.002250 from been experience with i mean someone else certainly you wouldn't want your child's day care person to yell at them and scream at them and say do this do that you know you'd want them to
482.002250 487.458500 promote politeness and niceness you know the things that you would want any child to learn
487.458500 492.337375 and -[u]sually that's done through example not an actual sit down learn situation so
492.337375 497.980625 [silence]
497.980625 500.693125 uh-huh it is [laughter]

237.107750 248.791250 guys that was on the jury they were asking him if if you could believe a lawyer or if a lawyer's reputation was so tainted that he couldn't be believed
248.791250 251.424625 and one guy being selected

296.560625 298.027875 [silence]
298.027875 300.108375 the fact that they take our money

210.136125 224.977750 and i you know i think if we did know i think there would be a lot more chaos than there is because i don't i don't think people could handle it so i think there are things that we should not know the masses shouldn't know but i also agree that there are a lot of crooks and liars too

289.736000 293.915625 putting putting any of my family in an elderly 
293.915625 299.019500 home to me would be the very last resort you know it
299.019500 307.986500 um and i know it's hard for a lot of families if you're trying to to work or trying to take care of your own family it's kind of hard to
307.986500 312.087250 to to because an elderly person sometimes can be
312.087250 321.130875 totally dependent you know on you and i know that's hard sometimes and but it would really have to be a last resort because that would just i would feel so guilty
321.130875 326.075625 just i don't know unless i knew that they were somewhere just really
326.075625 330.412750 i mean just really great you know that they were really enjoying
330.412750 332.431625 [silence]

398.103875 399.907000 [silence]
399.907000 403.120125 that's something that i mean if i had to work
403.120125 406.476125 in an elderly home i don't think i could do it
406.476125 408.739000 like i i would really like to be a teacher
408.739000 411.826125 but i don't think i could do it because i'm very very emotional
411.826125 419.466750 and the minute i mean the minute something happens i mean i cry on i mean you know Hallmark commercials but i'm just that's just the end of me
419.466750 422.311875 and so i mean something real life i just i'm
422.311875 426.121875 i uh interview a lot of children i'm an education reporter
426.121875 429.796375 and i always go you know everyday i'm doing an education things and
429.796375 437.094000 i meet these kids who are you know dropping out of school left and right and all the sudden they're in this program they're making straight A's they're going to graduate early
437.094000 444.658000 and i'm just i just want to hug them and go you are just fantastic and you know i could just imagine you know working in a home like that
444.658000 448.421500 and those people they're so sweet and and so genuine
448.421500 452.697625 you know and all they want is just for everything to be happy and you know
452.697625 457.970750 and so that would probably just tear me apart i mean in a good way but you know
457.970750 459.114250 [silence]

499.354125 501.193875 and children i mean
501.193875 503.812875 usually a lot of elderly people like to
503.812875 512.374875 they like to uh share their experiences with the younger children they'll be telling them all kinds of stories that they don't even know what they mean but
512.374875 517.710250 you know they feel like they've lived life so they need to share it and i'm sure i'll be like that too

34.726750 42.128875 yeah yeah i agree with you i um a group that i'm a part of goes once a month to a um they call it the Heritage House
42.128875 51.473000 they call it the Heritage House it's it's a nursing home for elderly people and this particular one has people that are in pretty bad shape a lot of them have had
51.473000 56.517375 um limbs amputated or um have serious illnesses you know that kind of thing and
56.517375 67.731500 um i watched the interesting thing was i watched this particular one change hands it started out just being a terrible place for the people and then a new company bought it
67.731500 75.783500 and came in and remodeled the whole place hired new nurses and uh just really just redid it you know
75.783500 80.499750 [silence]
80.499750 88.580000 well to me it was dirty for one thing uh when you would walk in the smell was just awful though you know the floors you could just
88.580000 99.287000 if you're walking on them feel how filthy they were um there were a lot of people just kind of up and down the halls laying in their beds hollering and you know crying and
99.287000 105.199250 of course i don't know how many of them were you know not in their right mind or how many were
105.199250 110.941500 you know yeah yeah i just really don't know but i feel like they were neglected and um
110.941500 112.908875 [silence]

113.969375 115.030000 right
115.030000 121.857250 right i don't really think anyone was being you know cruel or or trying to mistreat them or anything i just think they were
121.857250 127.737375 just not doing anymore you know than they had to do and um just kind of letting everybody live
127.737375 129.673875 [laughter] in a not very good environment
129.673875 137.502750 but this new company came in and they like i said they remodeled the place and it smells nice when you walk in and it looks nice and
137.502750 149.430625 they got like several new color TV's for the people and and redid the dining room where they made it you know a lot more interesting place for them to be they made a little patio area where they can go outside and
149.430625 154.087375 yeah just you know small things that make it seem a lot more
154.087375 159.281250 yeah and it's like it's a lot more like an apartment place instead of just uh horrible
159.281250 168.881375 [silence]

203.940500 205.547375 yeah
205.547375 212.951500 well they uh this place that we visit it's really neat they have everyday they have schedules of groups that come in and
212.951500 224.855375 they will do bingo our group does a church service once a month and and then other groups come in and do the services you know other Sundays so that they have at least one service every Sunday and
224.855375 229.327125 so there are a lot of things there are places that have a lot of things for them to do
229.327125 232.379625 but you really do have to kind of seek it out you know and
232.379625 236.581750 and make sure that it's not a place like this one was [laughter]
236.581750 237.720875 [silence]
237.720875 246.854750 yeah yeah yeah it is it's real nice and um i know our church does it and there are a lot of other churches and they are just like civic organizations that do
246.854750 257.606875 and uh i have other friends it's kinds of neat they take animals over and let the people pet them like they also have a dog that maybe needs a home and they will wash it all up and
257.606875 264.584125 make sure it's it's a friendly animal you know and take it in and let just let the old elderly people pet the dogs
264.584125 265.561875 yeah
265.561875 267.994375 [silence]

269.428875 271.631375 yeah yeah
271.631375 277.514000 yeah yeah i thought that was a real unusual thing for someone to do so
277.514000 283.027375 yeah there's a lot that can be done it's just a matter of people not being lazy
283.027375 290.504625 and you know doing the best they can again i don't know what i'd do if it was my own mother or grandmother you know uh that would be
290.504625 296.937750 [silence]

332.497125 335.526000 [silence]
335.526000 340.381750 yeah well i have interesting conversations with a lot of these people because um
340.381750 343.915125 um many of them of course their minds are not good
343.915125 348.479500 and so a lot them have told me exactly the same story you know every time i visit them
348.479500 356.547125 they'll tell me reminisce about childhood and tell me something that they did and then the next time i go it's the same thing you know but
356.547125 361.571250 just somebody to listen to them uh just seems to make them really feel good
361.571250 375.132750 right i'll tell you the people i feel the sorriest for there's a guy at this particular one i go to that i think that he's really an intelligent person but he has cerebral palsy so bad that he just cannot communicate
375.132750 384.561750 and um he's blind and he has seizures you know i mean he's just like in a world of his own and yet he wants so much to be around people
384.561750 394.109500 and if you come over to him if he can touch your hand he'll grab it and kiss it and oh he's always got a smile i mean he really tries to
394.109500 401.117750 to brighten up your life oh it's just amazing um but he can't say anything he can just kind of make noises you know
401.117750 405.769875 [silence]

454.265250 456.725125 oh it does yeah
456.725125 459.811875 yeah yeah it is it's really hard and
459.811875 466.563375 but one of the neatest things i think though is we always take our kids i have a three year old and a six year old and they um
466.563375 470.481000 have gotten comfortable being around these people because they've always gone with us
470.481000 472.586375 and the people love them and
472.586375 479.085750 they want the children you know to hug them or hold their hand and so far my kids will do it just real easily
479.085750 486.794875 and i think it's because they've gone since they were real little and they've never been afraid but that's something to me children
486.794875 492.800000 you know need to people need to take groups of children [laughter] because the kids just brighten up their lives they
492.800000 500.373625 as we walk through the the lobby they'll all say bring her here i want to see her [laughter] i would love to hold her
500.373625 506.488125 [silence]

520.775750 523.063375 [silence]
523.063375 527.912625 yeah yeah there are and and uh it really helps those people i think
527.912625 533.810625 but like you said i'd really have a lot of second thoughts before i put any of my own family members there
533.810625 535.340750 it would be a last resort
535.340750 536.415500 [silence]
536.415500 542.076500 oh i know i'm always afraid like oh no what if i lose my mind am i going to end up in a place like that [laughter]

156.989000 162.143000 and they do take up a big part of my uh my evening and weekend
162.143000 167.820875 and it's tough being a parent and trying to do all the things that you should do for yourself too [laughter]
167.820875 171.358375 it's uh something they don't tell you about when you're growing up
171.358375 175.913500 yes when you become a parent most of your life is going to be dedicated to your children
175.913500 178.028500 [laughter]

223.805875 224.809875 [silence]
224.809875 227.348625 well there's you you have to
227.348625 232.040375 uh what i found from my experiences you have to budget time for yourself
232.040375 239.759625 and then uh the you you can use what ever rationale you want but basically the healthier you stay the longer you'll live
239.759625 249.809875 and uh you know if i spend a little bit of time each day or a little bit of time every other day doing something for me to make me live longer well then i'll be around a lot longer
249.809875 258.752875 those people that i'm taking the ten minutes or twenty minutes away from now well you know get the enjoyment of me years past where i would have been if i hadn't taken it
258.752875 262.625125 so if you kind of think of it as a rationale like that it works out fine
262.625125 271.560125 [silence]
271.560125 272.963000 um

311.943375 313.967500 [silence]
313.967500 318.500500 oh i've done a lot of study over the years and i found that uh
318.500500 323.988500 probably one of the worst things that uh anybody can ingest is chlorinated water
323.988500 334.159750 yeah um the research i've done and uh i've actually been in the drinking watering business since eighty three and
334.159750 341.872500 it's it's amazing that uh you know like prior to like nineteen twenty there were n[ot]- very few heart attacks
341.872500 354.750625 there were none prior to nineteen hundred well in nineteen O three they started experimenting with chlorinating the water in nineteen thirteen most of the major cities had chlorinated water and after that we started having the hearts attacks
354.750625 361.710750 and uh Dr Price wrote a book Coronarys Cholesterol and Chlorine you can usually find it at a health food store
361.710750 364.753875 i know they had it in health food stores in Plano i used to live in Plano
364.753875 365.777250 that's
365.777250 375.198875 uh Dr Price yeah and it's amazing he makes the in you know it's a very small book and the guy's very opinionated
375.198875 386.495375 um but he makes a very good case against chlorine there were no heart attacks before we started using it and he s[ays]- points out that people in uh England and uh or eating diets
386.495375 390.561250 that quadrupled the amount of cholesterol that we're ingesting now
390.561250 394.352875 and they weren't dropping dead of heart attacks and
394.352875 398.946375 yeah he did some experiments on chickens whose arteries are very similar to ours
398.946375 406.523750 and uh proved that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis which is the clogging of the arteries and uh
406.523750 417.429250 you know he's uh there's been a lot of reports since then and this whole thing about you know first it was stress then they went to cholesterol and now they're saying what's cholesterol well there's good cholesterol and there's bad cholesterol and
417.429250 429.157625 you know it's it's it's amazing what he points out in that book and that um in fact he even uh there was a uh toxicologist for the Environmental Protection Agency
429.157625 434.888125 who did work back in nineteen eighty six who wrote a letter to Dr Price in nineteen eighty seven
434.888125 441.691125 and in this letter he praised Dr Price for the work he did back in the sixties on this
441.691125 449.277250 and said that the EPA had been doing experiments on non human primates and proving that injection of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis
449.277250 451.963125 and EPA never published that report
451.963125 454.248375 [silence]

485.394500 489.442375 [silence]
489.442375 492.827000 yeah there's there's a there's a lot of good information out there
492.827000 498.602250 uh about health and a lot of the uh a lot of the myths they've been passing around people are
498.602250 505.533625 are starting to realize aren't true i mean i'm all for having a diet high in fiber and all that because_1 that's that's good for you
505.533625 514.622500 uh but to to believe some of the things that they you know and i don't think anybody should be going out there and eating a high high fat diet
514.622500 521.274500 but to think that that solely alone is going to cause something like arteriosclerosis is
521.274500 523.484625 it's just hard to believe
523.484625 527.259250 [silence]
527.259250 528.500875 um-hum
528.500875 535.257125 [silence]
535.257125 537.298625 yeah i actually
537.298625 539.756875 eat pretty much anything that i want
539.756875 546.827500 and i've had my cholesterol checked and uh you know a few times and i've never been above uh like a hundred and fifty
546.827500 548.166125 never
548.166125 550.194250 and uh
550.194250 552.145500 uh i mean i

557.097625 557.846250 y[ou]- y[ou]-
557.846250 560.430750 well what they tell me but i mean you know
560.430750 565.921750 everything's like within uh five to ten percent and all [laughter-that] [laughter-kind] [laughter-of] [laughter-thing] [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter]
565.921750 568.865000 [laughter] they leave themselves wide open so they can't be sued

569.938875 571.012750 [silence]
571.012750 575.589000 but uh we've uh i work at the TI site in Hunt Valley Maryland
575.589000 578.889875 yeah and we've had a few of the health fairs up here and
578.889875 581.009250 you know i've always come out aces
581.009250 585.415875 and i'm you know i'm not really that big on on watching what i eat
585.415875 590.167750 i i do eat you know some health cookies that are high in fiber and
590.167750 595.848750 low in fat and all that kind of stuff but i mean as far as being really concerned about
595.848750 600.851000 ingesting too much uh chlorine i'm not or cholesterol i'm not worried about

0.000000 1.017250 [silence]

68.767500 71.144250 well right now um
71.144250 80.112875 i try to when it's nice out it's been raining a lot this spring but i try to i have a bicycle and i like to cycle a lot
80.112875 88.280250 and uh my husband and i we have entered a few rallies that's pretty popular in Texas i don't know if it's up north but
88.280250 99.524250 like every weekend a small town will sponsor a rally and uh thousands of people come with their bikes and ride over hilly terrain for thirty or forty miles
99.524250 105.905750 which that's a lot of fun um so we try to r[ide]- ride during the week to stay in shape for that
105.905750 112.287375 and um TI where i work has uh a fitness center so
112.287375 121.486125 a lot of times after work or maybe on the weekend we'd go over there and lift weights and do the treadmill and um
121.486125 127.973625 they have stair masters and all kinds of new machines that are fun to ride and
127.973625 130.504250 and workout on so
130.504250 134.624500 i try to i'm trying to stay in shape on a regular basis
134.624500 143.601750 i used to get into it and then get out of it based on my schedule so i'm trying to stay in in shape on a regular basis now
143.601750 149.705000 but it's a big commitment we don't have any kids yet so that's a lot of the part of it
149.705000 151.636250 [laughter]
151.636250 156.289875 [silence]
156.289875 157.524000 uh-huh

161.428000 162.698125 yeah
162.698125 167.076500 [silence]
167.076500 168.266750 yeah
168.266750 175.492875 [silence]
175.492875 176.722875 uh-huh
176.722875 180.854125 that's why uh th[ey]- they uh really stress
180.854125 188.467750 um at TI they really stress staying in shape but like i[n]- staying fit overall fitness you know no smoking and all that but
188.467750 194.421875 it's it's hard to find uh a actual exercise regimen that works for you you know
194.421875 201.693625 because_1 like i know a lot of people that cycle they take their kids behind them_1 on the bikes and i don't know if that would work for me because
201.693625 208.952875 i don't know i wouldn't want to pull a kid over hilly terrain but you know it's really hard to find something that works
208.952875 211.358750 and i[t]- you know to find time
211.358750 215.946375 to do it and stay committed to it like three days a week or whatever
215.946375 223.101750 i think maybe walking or running would probably work because_1 you it doesn't take much time and much money or whatever
223.101750 224.540000 [silence]
224.540000 226.028375 yeah
226.028375 231.268750 [silence]

259.267250 263.117875 [silence]
263.117875 266.633125 yeah um i've been learning a lot lately about
266.633125 272.116125 um i've been reading a book by Kenneth Cooper i don't know if you're f[amiliar]- are familiar with him
272.116125 279.161250 he was the pioneer of aerobics and all of health really he's kind of re[did]-
279.161250 281.709625 um uh just pretty much
281.709625 291.222500 the [noise] innovator of the whole exercise thing um and he was talking about the three things you could that cause
291.222500 297.166625 aging are smoking inactivity and <b_aside> what was the other one <e_aside>
297.166625 298.350875 [silence]
298.350875 306.139125 <b_aside> i think it was <e_aside> yeah obesity so if you can control those three areas then you are going to live longer you know
306.139125 308.047625 [silence]
308.047625 310.520125 because_1 those are risk factors so
310.520125 313.170625 anyway it's kind of a tip
313.170625 323.655125 [silence]
323.655125 325.697625 [laughter-really] [noise]

515.866000 523.024125 [silence]
523.024125 528.191000 if you get a chance read Dr Cooper's book on controlling cholesterol
528.191000 532.297375 that's a real good um he talks about that talks about
532.297375 535.748500 high risk factors and heart disease and all that
535.748500 537.657750 [silence]

589.389250 590.577875 yeah
590.577875 600.851000 [silence]

0.000000 10.831250 yeah i think um this is a tough subject because uh when you come from two different parts of the country uh the political views are really different
10.831250 17.288500 i uh i i guess i've had to discuss a number of what might be considered controversial issues
17.288500 23.517375 i guess like like they're nothing i guess nothing is a[s]- as awful as abortion but like gun control 
23.517375 33.521625 and uh daycare and things like that and there are some very different views uh of the people connected with the program which i thought was really interesting you know 
33.521625 36.424000 [silence]
36.424000 37.391875 w[ell]- 
37.391875 49.469875 yeah well being i[n]- in in Baltimore see Maryland is um is sort um is prob[ably]- l[iberalism]- as a as a hub of liberalism [laughter] you know compared to the country uh you know very um 
49.469875 60.429625 in in many ways uh very liberal very somewhat to New England though Pennsylvania and New York uh i aren't actually as liberal Maryland is a very liberal uh
60.429625 70.770500 state so so wh[ere]- where here we have um we have gun control laws we probably have some of the strictest gun controls laws in the nation and most people in Maryland vote for that 
70.770500 73.330125 you know so it really is a different um
73.330125 78.620000 [silence]
78.620000 85.206875 yeah that's that's true i talked to a i had to talk about gun control with somebody and i talked with a woman who actually 
85.206875 94.317000 you know h[ad]- h[ad]- had just purchased a gun that day and was going target shooting you know and it was very different it was a whole different view it's really um 
94.317000 102.546625 this has opened my eyes to thinking you know at one time i just sat here and thought well how can anybody believe that because i'd really never met people that did
102.546625 106.061000 and now i talk to people that do so that's it's really interesting 
106.061000 108.740000 [silence]
108.740000 109.549250 um-hum

144.738500 152.925125 [silence]
152.925125 167.092500 yeah well you can possess them_1 here too but they have to be they're registered and uh like the the the Brady Bill that's currently being discussed nationally and whatever is very well supported here in gun control avenues and um 
167.092500 169.163750 [silence]
169.163750 171.548375 you have the seven day waiting period
171.548375 173.422625 yeah that's uh that's

175.973000 176.956000 yeah
176.956000 187.267500 [silence]
187.267500 192.440625 yeah that's true that's very true that's and that's the way m[ost]- i guess most of the um the 
192.440625 199.238625 the political organizations work you know the same i know the abortion issue with right to life and right to choose and 
199.238625 209.688500 and both of them are uh both want the extent of extremes so that they don't give anything for a balance you know there's there's always that difficulty 
209.688500 210.260750 [noise]
210.260750 212.324125 [silence]
212.324125 215.287625 um i would say i'm probably liberal yeah
215.287625 216.580250 yeah
216.580250 217.854375 sure
217.854375 224.975500 [silence]
224.975500 226.226500 well i'll tell you
226.226500 232.383875 i i think you know if they if they didn't give as much coverage to these idiots that burn the flag 
232.383875 234.825125 it would never happen do you know what i mean
234.825125 246.975750 it's only because they make a big stink over it but i i guess actually i believe that if somebody wants to burn the flag i guess that's their opportunity their their their right in the sense of freedom of speech but i- i would never 
246.975750 247.754000 yeah 
247.754000 250.940500 [silence]
250.940500 252.163750 yeah
252.163750 261.058875 well it's free[dom]- that they i think the idea of freedom of speech goes back to and i uh uh the the the whole aspect of being able to display your 
261.058875 262.379500 uh
262.379500 267.874000 your ideas you know the what the country stands on America stands on is that they can do that
267.874000 273.671500 i though i would never even consider it in a million years to do it myself i i i think uh 
273.671500 288.219375 you know but i i still what the stan[ds]- flag stands for i guess to me is that if somebody wants to voice their opinion or display their opinion openly and if that is a a way that they can show their opinion then they should be allowed 
288.219375 289.518875 uh
289.518875 299.874250 unless the bur[ning]- unless the actual fire hinders somebody's health and well-being you know but i i think that's i guess that's i thin[k]- that's my opinion yeah i guess you feel differently 
299.874250 302.642125 [silence] 
302.642125 315.078750 uh no but i think that's that's the it's that's taxpayer's money if somebody buys their own flag and and burns it that's fine but that that's you know that's destruction and o[f]- of uh 
315.078750 317.416250 public property and whatever 
317.416250 329.591750 [silence]
329.591750 337.101875 no i don't know i guess the symbolism oh i think what America stands for is the right to be able to disagree with the government
337.101875 340.075500 uh i think that's what's made democracy
340.075500 341.150250 yeah
341.150250 342.125125 [silence]
342.125125 343.542500 um-hum yeah 
343.542500 345.832000 [silence]
345.832000 350.182000 well that's that's true yeah but i think i i g[uess]- 
350.182000 360.789375 yeah i i g[uess]- i guess the idea you know they always keep saying like the framers um there uh of one of the Republican the appointees for the ju[dicial]- the judicial bench 
360.789375 371.542000 and they always talk about that they they feel that this person believes in the framing of the constitution what the original framers the ideals the original framers set down and um 
371.542000 383.579625 i believe that the idea of burning the flag is is in my understanding of how it was framed is that you this coun[try]- the thing about this country is that you can disagree with its government and you can display that 
383.579625 393.026250 uh i g[uess]- yeah i guess and and so that as a freedom of expression and speech and whatever i- i think that that's viable [noise] um 
393.026250 401.887625 as long as it's your flag and and you've made your your point i think yeah yeah because realistically like for you for you you don't think it's right 
401.887625 407.171375 and i would never do it i i love this country too much and that symbol means a lot to me 
407.171375 413.458750 um but i guess it's just one of those things where if they if that's what's something if a need for them 
413.458750 414.736125 you know
414.736125 419.817875 [silence]
419.817875 421.600250 yeah yes

452.042375 462.687500 [silence]
462.687500 466.913000 i agree there too i agree with you there too i i the um 
466.913000 474.221750 i i it's i find it you know personally disgusting but i don't think that i don't think that uh 
474.221750 483.865375 we have a right to stop somebody from that you know the same i don't know i guess i get i get all all mixed up inside when 
483.865375 497.417000 yeah it g[ets]- when it's uh it's an emotional issue and you sit and you try and think about it logically and and and you know you try to say to yourself now emotionally this is a disgusting thing uh but logically 
497.417000 505.563375 um even you know for instance the pro-life pro-choice movement uh you know i don't know anybody that actually supports abortion 
505.563375 508.270000 but they would vote pro-choice 
508.270000 518.027375 because you know that's just a disgusting thing you know somebody an abortion means it's somebody's in trouble and that it's an awful thing 
518.027375 519.075375 you know but
519.075375 520.606375 [silence]
520.606375 521.712750 yeah
521.712750 533.412750 but it that's uh that's what i mean see mo[st]- but but realistically when you think of it it just sounds like such an awful thing and it evokes an emotional response i think that's the hardest thing i don't know if i could ever be a judge 
533.412750 538.612125 because some things emotionally just aren't you know
538.612125 541.377750 [silence]
541.377750 544.436125 no no i think the um
544.436125 550.109750 sometimes i guess what did i read recently the um the the uh Christian 
550.109750 555.259750 uh point i[s]- is always the point of well it's at conception 
555.259750 567.287125 but then um a friend of mine's a doctor and argues with others that conception is a biblical term and there's no concept of conception in medicine or biology 
567.287125 578.408375 so then that so that throws out that idea it makes it a religious discussion then so it['s]- i don't know it's very it's it's uh you know it's a it's a topsy turvy world and it's really something how 
578.408375 585.777250 um political ideas and viewpoints within one country can vary so much and also within um
585.777250 586.849125 within a
586.849125 588.205875 [silence]
588.205875 592.869250 yeah and how yeah how it'll sway from one e[xtreme]- one extreme to another 
592.869250 595.281250 uh i think that uh 
595.281250 600.579750 you know i i just read something i think in Time magazine uh ab[out]- about um protest on 

0.000000 17.147125 [silence]

109.522750 112.709750 although i claim Florida as my home now
112.709750 116.181125 uh i have two sons living down there but 
116.181125 128.926375 but i also have two sons living elsewhere one in Tennessee one in Mississippi but i lived in Te[nnessee]- in Florida for ten years and i kind of like it down there but they had a gun control law which went a little bit too far 
128.926375 133.170000 i think uh well in your words they were a little bit too liberal
133.170000 135.255750 [laughter] 
135.255750 141.139750 i mean they p[ermitted]- they i believe if i'm correct i believe they permitted to carrying concealed weapons 
141.139750 147.440125 but they uh [noise] quickly did away with it i think in the next session they they uh modified it 
147.440125 153.280000 but it's still legal to own or possess weapons in uh uh Florida
153.280000 166.742375 [silence]

248.179000 252.667125 it's their right by f[reedom]- freedom of speech what does speech have to do with burning a flag

302.410000 316.831000 [silence]
316.831000 323.378250 uh then you don't draw a line between public property and uh uh uh

418.167875 422.120000 physically you agree with me you you wouldn't do it yourself
422.120000 429.329875 but nevertheless you maintain that it's it is the right of of any citizen to burn the symbol of their country

443.789250 453.001500 and i used to know as a Boy Scout but all i remember was the red in the flag represented blood tha[t]- that was shed to to create this country and to maintain it 
453.001500 455.541500 and to me that's 
455.541500 462.600000 uh uh a a black eye to every man that ever [noise] uh carried a weapon or killed for his country

9.390500 43.766875 [silence]
43.766875 48.254875 yeah i uh i spent a couple uh years down in uh Plano Texas
48.254875 55.594375 and uh i was one of the home owners down there that got taxed to death for the uh Plano uh school system
55.594375 65.161625 and uh i [vocalized-noise] you know i know that Texas doesn't have a state tax and so all the things come out of the the property taxes
65.161625 77.172625 and i was uh really shocked at the amount of taxes i ended up paying i was i was better off paying a state tax [vocalized-noise] back in Maryland where [laughter] than i was uh paying the uh property tax down there
77.172625 89.263125 uh what they did in Maryland to get around that is they uh they developed a renters tax solely for the purpose of paying for the services [noise] that the renters were getting including the uh educational services
89.263125 94.164375 and uh the tax was administered by um
94.164375 106.445375 [noise] the uh rental company that actually was managing the apartments so when uh long long time ago when i used to live in apartments i would pay a rent
106.445375 109.750375 payment every month and a tax payment every month
109.750375 112.792375 and the tax payment went to pay for the services that i was
112.792375 115.834375 getting as a a resident of that particular county
115.834375 119.693875 and uh that's the way it worked here in Maryland we have uh
119.693875 128.438500 a certain portion of your your property taxes uh goes to education but also a portion of the state tax that you pay
128.438500 131.608875 goes back into the county that you live in
131.608875 134.506375 to pay for the educational system
134.506375 140.167375 and so it it works out nice it it it makes it so that the
140.167375 153.987250 uh whole county now i- i know the concept of counties in Texas is quite a bit different than it is here in Maryland uh like Collin County uh would only equal about maybe an eighth the size of Baltimore County here in Maryland
153.987250 156.737500 i mean the the counties are much larger
156.737500 161.607500 you know in the the whole state of Maryland i believe there's only like uh fifteen counties
161.607500 169.542375 and so uh you know each county has their own school system an and it works out real nice um
169.542375 181.852000 the the flip side to this is are we getting what we're paying for and i don't believe so um a lot of things have come to head recently and i heard a report because of uh
181.852000 185.108750 uh the emphasis that the President was putting on education
185.108750 193.445750 you know um him running as our education president and then finally a couple of years later getting around to doing something um
193.445750 206.886875 [noise] they said since they imposed the federal regulations on education in other words they came up with this federalized system where everyone in the third grade would be taught basically the same thing
206.886875 220.033750 and then at the end of uh school year they would be tested and then they go into the fourth grade and everybody in the fourth grade's basically taught the same thing so when they came up with these this nationwide system of public schools
220.033750 232.709250 uh they gave some figures out and since it's inception uh they've the price has gone up per stu[dent]- the prices paid by the federal government per student has been thirty three percent
232.709250 244.303000 and so they're actually spending thirty three percent and that's real dollars you know adjusting it back to to the days you know when it started uh probably you know seventy years ago
244.303000 249.976500 and what they've said is that we haven't had a thirty three percent improvement in education
249.976500 252.354000 we've actually gone backwards
252.354000 259.024000 [silence]
259.024000 260.527125 yeah
260.527125 266.950375 [silence]
266.950375 274.311750 yeah well they they've been having some problems uh even here in uh like Baltimore City which is a a pretty good ci[ty]- goo[d]- good sized city
274.311750 289.106375 uh they've been putting a lot of uh stress on it and of course speaking of stress the teachers are all getting stressed out from trying to you know do everything they're supposed to do and of course they've uh been cutting the teachers salaries because they say we don't have the money to do it and
289.106375 299.052750 all the services are costing more money and and everything uh but the uh a lot of emphas[is]- now is being put on you know when children used to be taught
299.052750 304.945625 you know like uh uh each child is individual you know they're not all the same
304.945625 306.405125 and
306.405125 320.487625 some students do horrible until like eighth grade some do horrible you know until they get to like tenth grade and then all of a sudden everything clicks in you know and then there are some students that you know read well at five years old
320.487625 333.306500 and you know seem to excel and so that the you know one of the things i heard proposed on uh one of the public radio stations up here was that we should go back to teaching children at their own speed
333.306500 335.211625 some kids
335.211625 336.989750 yeah
336.989750 342.390000 [silence]
342.390000 344.068750 and and uh
344.068750 348.255375 and on top of that they they make the child feel inferior
348.255375 352.779500 because he's not as good as another kid his same age i mean it's like
352.779500 355.027125 you know that's ridiculous
355.027125 358.295750 [silence]
358.295750 369.032125 yeah and uh you know i have uh i- i have five children total and i've got two out of the house already and i ha[ve]- i have two that are in uh eighth grade this year
369.032125 373.529625 and prior to their um
373.529625 379.242375 when i when they were in elementary school they were identi[fied]- identified as being slow
379.242375 386.127750 and so they put them into special programs and then we actually held them back in fourth grade
386.127750 388.185875 and
388.185875 400.912375 it wasn't until the last two years um last year my uh they're they're a set of twins um a boy and a girl last year the the uh boy twin started doing real well
400.912375 410.976000 and it it it everything started to click in for him and he knew what he needed to do um and this year it it happened for uh for the daughter
410.976000 413.640875 she just has been
413.640875 425.053500 really doing great this year and she has the right attitude towards school and everything and i think it's just a matter of everybody has to find their own path i remember when i was in school i did horrible
425.053500 426.876625 up until about
426.876625 439.513000 yeah about the seventh eighth grade i- i- i started to to come around and realize an and basically i got interested in math and uh never really did well in English but you know once you got interested in something
439.513000 442.382000 and things started to click in place
442.382000 444.619875 [vocalized-noise] then after that you take off
444.619875 453.023250 [silence]
453.023250 454.960250 um-hum
454.960250 459.374625 [silence]
459.374625 460.970000 yeah
460.970000 474.473500 [silence]
474.473500 476.386500 jeez
476.386500 489.781875 yeah it is um my children had a uh real culture shock um when we lived in Plano i guess i don't know if you've heard about the Plano school district but they're uh they really stress academics there
489.781875 498.497000 and uh God if your child is not an honor student well then [laughter] you're something wrong with you as a parent and tha[t]- that's kind of the way they are there
498.497000 503.861250 and uh when we moved back to Maryland um i moved to a uh a
503.861250 507.066875 [vocalized-noise] Baltimore County which is a northern county in Maryland
507.066875 512.414375 and it's basically a rural county once you get above about the half way point
512.414375 518.680000 and we lived you know in the northern part of the county uh we went from a uh
518.680000 528.938875 middle school in Texas that served fifty five square blocks to a uh middle school in Maryland that served fifty five square miles
528.938875 541.867250 and it was just a complete culture shock because i mean they they're riding on the bus in the morning with uh other kids that you know are a sleep because_1 they got up at three o'clock and were doing chores and [laughter-you] know it's
541.867250 554.640875 and they had uh ag[ricultural]- they had an ag[ricultural]- course uh i forget what it was called uh but it goes along the the lines of industrial arts but it's agricultural and where they had to raise a small animal
554.640875 557.707625 had to learn how to drive a tractor
557.707625 565.631625 they actually had to g[o]- take a driving test on the tractor i mean they just couldn't believe this and it was great they loved it
565.631625 568.276750 i mean they really enjoyed the courses
568.276750 569.705500 um
569.705500 577.625375 and it you know it made school fun for them again because prior to that school was just a big pain a drain
577.625375 578.721500 [silence]
578.721500 584.430000 yeah and it was you know it was like [laughter] kind of like the way we feel about going to work [laughter]
584.430000 586.030250 [laughter]
586.030250 588.788125 [silence]
588.788125 594.586250 but uh up here they seem to have made it uh a lot of fun for them_1 and they they seem to really enjoy it
594.586250 599.849500 [silence]

0.000000 1.821375 [silence]
1.821375 8.447125 well i think i don't know how your schools work back there but we support our schools here with property taxes
8.447125 13.225000 and the land owners or home owners are the ones that pay the school tax
13.225000 16.783250 so if you're renting a house or doing anything else you're not
16.783250 21.573500 actually contributing to the education of your children
21.573500 29.910125 and i think that's wrong i think everybody should contribute to the education of their children even if they had to raise the sales tax by one percent
29.910125 34.531375 then everybody going through the state would be supporting our education system
34.531375 36.193125 [vocalized-noise]
36.193125 38.891000 as it turns out we don't really have a
38.891000 43.225500 tremendous education system because they don't have the money they need to run it
43.225500 47.361375 [silence]

249.445000 251.431000 no huh-uh
251.431000 259.791375 well they say that Texas schools are some of the lowest in the nation that our high school graduates can't even match the national average 
259.791375 263.322875 so you know our school system down here is 
263.322875 267.356750 no where near perfect but they keep complaining they don't have the money to do it
267.356750 273.776125 [silence]
273.776125 274.706875 yeah

320.901250 333.576375 [silence]
333.576375 336.083000 yeah i think it'd be a lot better
336.083000 342.026250 you know each child has to learn at his own rate they can't keep force feeding things to each other and
342.026250 344.474125 or you know at the kids
344.474125 347.730000 [silence]
347.730000 351.484125 um-hum because_1 he can't do it

352.626375 353.768500 [silence]
353.768500 357.468375 and it's not that he can't do it he just can't do it quite as fast or

456.040125 461.118500 fancy stuff to worry about you know we had our auto shop out there and our ag[ricultural]- shop and
461.118500 465.234125 you know we had just about every thing that we needed but they don't have it anymore 
465.234125 468.334250 there's a lot of things that they don't do in school anymore
468.334250 473.506375 o[ur]- our oldest boy goes to Lubbock High down here and they go to school four and half days a week 
473.506375 475.578875 [silence]

538.808500 541.560750 yeah

588.575125 594.282750 [silence]
594.282750 597.028375 that's good our oldest boy went into
597.028375 599.849500 school politics and made vice

0.000000 0.972250 [noise]
0.972250 9.341750 okay um i think that in this day and age everyone needs to have some sort of exposure to community service
9.341750 18.183625 because it it seems like and i'm i'm thinking of the commu[nity]- of community of people that are in jail now i think that maybe if if
18.183625 33.140250 if some of those people had gotten exposed to the community gotten exposed to working with other people that some of the things that they did they would not have done because they w[ould]- they understand people more they understand helping people more they understand the plight of people
33.140250 44.152250 [silence]
44.152250 45.075625 right

52.699000 53.807875 [silence]
53.807875 59.230375 um-hum i would think that for like people that are just filthy filthy rich
59.230375 64.633375 i think that they would benefit also in doing community service so that they
64.633375 68.203250 can see and i'm i'm speaking about people that are like born rich
68.203250 79.668625 and that's all they know and i'm thinking that community service would help them uh just get a feel of what else is out there how other people are living you know if they were to work in in uh uh
79.668625 85.000125 i don't know in a soup kitchen or something they would understand how other people live
85.000125 89.362125 and uh you know on the same note if poor if
89.362125 95.000000 poorer people [laughter] uh were working to to serve the community
95.000000 100.511375 i don't know they probably have a better perspective of of i don't know just life itself

171.864375 178.633875 being he was exposed to that and maybe he wasn't before and now he sees and i think that anybody that works
178.633875 187.956125 in the in some kind of service or for the community or something they can see you know you don't see what you don't you can't know what you don't see
187.956125 193.997250 you know so and you have to experience some things you know a lot of people know that people that other people are poor
193.997250 196.626750 but you they don't know what poor is

241.841750 244.302625 or something like that and you can help a child
244.302625 245.561625 it's
245.561625 249.833125 i don't know i guess it's just me but i don't know whether to trust that or not

48.040125 51.989750 in the in uh a way of like self-gratification today

100.311000 107.130875 yeah and i think the Peace Corps is great too because uh it you go to different countries and you see
107.130875 113.726750 uh you know in fact i saw an interview on TV the other night with uh Patrick Swayze and he's making a movie in
113.726750 115.601125 i think it's uh
115.601125 121.969750 Calcutta or either India somewhere where it's a it's a very poor poor country
121.969750 124.872500 and he said that people in the West
124.872500 133.948500 he said since being there and i guess he's been there about six months he said that his whole idea of what's important has changed
133.948500 147.580750 and he said that people have no idea he said of of what human sacrifice is you know since being there he's he's learned to what it is to be poor and have nothing and yet those people have
147.580750 150.753000 uh such uh a happy
150.753000 160.928625 uh yeah in in other words they don't dwell on on what they don't have they dwell on what they do have and they're happy with each other type of thing
160.928625 167.654250 and he said that out here he said that when he comes back he knows that it it's ju[st]- completely changed his life

201.686000 214.888250 well i- i know that it that must be true especially if you do something along the lines of uh you know helping them learn how to survive how to plant how to find water and i've seen so many uh
214.888250 218.867250 extraordinary things on TV that people have done
218.867250 224.978625 working in the Peace Corps and how you know uh the people or the community they worked in is so much better
224.978625 227.488125 it's like one person can make a difference
227.488125 231.250625 and i- i really believe that they can in something like that

270.267250 271.707750 i know
271.707750 277.244000 it's true it really is it's the sad life i think today it's um
277.244000 288.632250 it's it it's not like it used to be even in in the years of my growing up i mean i'm fifty three years old and i have seen a town change from a town to a city
288.632250 294.397125 and it's uh people you know grow from a small town to a large town
294.397125 304.422125 and you would think that more people would be better you know share more do more you know be more community oriented and all but if they just get more uh
304.422125 306.787625 unto themselves kind of
306.787625 311.754875 right and and it's not the sharing of uh a neighbor to a neighbor
311.754875 314.789125 and we would go out and not even lock our doors
314.789125 317.164750 and not even worry about it
317.164750 321.813000 but today i mean you know it's like you wouldn't even think of doing that
321.813000 325.523125 if you don't have bars on the window you're not even safe you know
325.523125 331.920000 [silence]

343.095500 345.472500 [silence]
345.472500 347.368125 in Dallas they
347.368125 360.881000 i was going to say because_1 i- i heard uh in fact i was talking to someone from Dallas uh just last week they was saying that uh in fact it was this one girl particularly that worked for TI and she had gone overseas to Tokyo
360.881000 369.345500 and she asked them there if there was some anywhere that she shouldn't go because_1 she was alone you know being a girl from another country and everything
369.345500 378.079875 and she said they thought for a few seconds and they said uh no there's nowhere that you can go that you would have to be afraid
378.079875 381.936125 they said to her that even if she left her purse
381.936125 384.030000 on the subway
384.030000 388.162375 okay that she would have that purse returned to her
388.162375 393.344625 this is how confident they were okay with nothing missing
393.344625 396.671125 okay this is a foreign country
396.671125 406.168750 and you would think you know uh being uh an American or whatever you know a foreigner there that that would be all the more reason that they'd take advantage of you
406.168750 408.248875 okay
408.248875 416.446250 and she told me she said she could tell them for fifteen minutes places not to go in in and around Dallas
416.446250 418.754750 and that's where she was from
418.754750 425.143375 she said even choosing her apartment she had to be so careful because of being a woman alone
425.143375 427.751500 you know she had there are certain
427.751500 430.686625 [silence]
430.686625 432.159875 uh-huh
432.159875 435.186750 [silence]
435.186750 436.838125 oh yeah

464.897125 467.638625 [silence]
467.638625 471.181750 and that that's why i think if people were more exposed to
471.181750 475.051875 uh especially uh young kids getting out of high school
475.051875 484.854500 i mean at one time they would go into the service to have the same exposure and you know uh to further their worldliness so to speak
484.854500 494.060250 and go to see uh foreign countries that they would not necessarily be able to afford to see it was like they said join the Navy to see the world type of thing you know
494.060250 502.225250 but nowadays they don't do that anymore it's not uh a thing uh a lot of young men don't even uh
502.225250 504.963500 have the desire to go into the service
504.963500 508.888125 or to uh you know do something for someone else
508.888125 513.544500 and i don't know i- i attributed i think a lot of that to women working
513.544500 516.363125 you know to mothers not being at home
516.363125 518.891875 the bonding process yep
518.891875 524.496000 [silence]
524.496000 527.450750 it very definitely is
527.450750 533.210750 [silence]
533.210750 534.983125 that's right
534.983125 540.507875 [silence]
540.507875 541.534125 yep
541.534125 546.169000 and the thing is like i think a man can afford to support a woman
546.169000 549.369375 but the woman affords the luxuries
549.369375 556.424375 in in other words like anyone can live on a certain income no matter what it is you have to
556.424375 560.846500 so to speak okay it it's what's important to you
560.846500 568.114500 now a family i- i think that like girls today have children and six weeks later they're back to work
568.114500 572.612750 they don't even have a bonding with that child they don't eve[r]- ever see the
572.612750 579.892250 it's it's the most beautiful thing that happens between a mother and a child the first like say six years of life
579.892250 584.401125 so much happens in that period of time
584.401125 589.997750 and i mean once the child's in school if you had a job from say nine to three
589.997750 599.755000 big deal i mean th[ey're]- they're in school you're at work that's great but it's kids that come home and don't have a mother there or the kids are at home in the morning and the
