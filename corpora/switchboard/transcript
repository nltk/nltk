[noise]
[silence]
uh do you have a pet Randy
[silence]
a poodle miniature or uh full size
[silence]
i read somewhere that the poodle is one of the the most intelligent dogs uh a[round]- around
[silence]
oh uh-huh so you you've only known the dog wh[at]- how long did you say th[at]-
[silence]
oh well uh is it uh uh how old is the dog
[silence]
oh it's still just a pup
[silence]
yeah i have a uh
well a mutt myself i call it a uh a {chowpherd}
it's uh part Chow and part Shepherd and it as i understand it uh both sides of the were thoroughbreds so she's a genuine {chowpherd}
[silence]
she has the the color and the black t[ongue]- tongue of a Chow
but uh she has the [cha[pe]-/shape] the shape of a uh uh Shepherd
[silence]
oh she weighs in at about fifty pounds so she's a medium size
but she's big enough to be intimidating it is a fi[xed]- a fixed female by the way
and right from day one she was teaching me
[silence]
[laughter]
she is she's the most intelligent dog i've ever seen
course i'm
little prejudiced of course
[noise]
no the first time i brought her home she was only uh was it six weeks old
and i spread the newspapers out in the kitchen area
but uh next morning she let me know in no uncertain terms that she wanted to use the bathroom
so on next night i spread the newspaper in the bathroom and she used them there
but it wasn't too long till she uh found out she could wait until i let her out in the morning
and since then uh i've i live alone
and uh i live in a motor home by the way i'm uh an RV full time RVer
and it's it's such a pleasure to come home at night and sh[e]- you can see her smiling from ear to ear she's so happy to see me
and uh i don't know if you get that kind of greeting or not
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
[laughter]
[silence]
well my dog's an outdoor type she does not like to be indoors
uh she'd rather sl[eep]- sleep outside on the the cold ground at night
but uh i do make her come in
and i feed her indoors that's to lure her in but during the day i have her on a uh on a leash
which is uh on sort of a run i have a a thirty foot cable
running from one stake to another and then attached to that is a uh twelve foot leash so she can cover quite an area
and uh she's the best uh
burglar alarm going
[silence]
oh yeah she uh it's the strangest thing though uh children
no matter how strange they are or how new they might be can uh walk right up to her
but adults if they're strange to her or or they look suspicious or something boy she acts like she wants to chew their leg off
and i have not discovered yet where the the line is between children and adults
[silence]
but sh[e]- uh she is a great comfort to me
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
oh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
what you mean she didn't appreciate all that attention
[silence]
uh-huh what's her name by the way
what uh what do you call the dog
Mitzi yeah mine is Gin
as in uh martini
[laughter]
actually it's Gin Two
because_1 uh when i was a teenager in high school i had Gin One
but then when i went out in the world i
couldn't take her with me
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
oh yeah
[silence]
oh what a shame
[silence]
um-hum
oh well
well Randy we've just about used up our time here and i must say it was interesting i enjoyed talking about pets with you
maybe we'll get together again in the future
take care now bye
[noise]

[noise]
uh yeah currently we have a poodle
yeah
uh it's a miniature
yeah
[silence]
well um i wouldn't uh i definitely wouldn't dispute that i[t's]- it's it's actually my wife's dog uh i i became part owner six months ago when we got married but uh
it uh definitely responds to uh to authority and i've had dogs in the past and uh
it seems it seems to uh respond real well i[t]- it she['s]- she's picked up a lot of things uh just just by uh teaching by force i guess is what i'd like to say [laughter]
[silence]
well about a year i guess
[silence]
it just turned two i believe
pretty much yeah yeah
[silence]
[laughter-okay]
[silence]
oh that sounds interesting
[silence]
oh that's that's neat how uh about how big then
[silence]
okay
yeah yeah
[silence]
most definitely
yeah
[silence]
oh i wouldn't doubt it yeah
[silence]
well that's understandable yeah that's uh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
okay
[silence]
oh
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
okay
[silence]
i see
[silence]
[laughter]
yeah definitely
[silence]
yeah i can honestly say we do um we uh just recently put a security system in our house and so now uh in order to uh
to accommodate the motion detectors we have to keep her uh uh locked up in the the master bedroom during the day and then she's got the the bedroom and the bathroom to for free run during the day but
we've always got a got a nose and a tongue pressed up against the window uh when we come walking up to the front door she's definitely ready to get out and r[un]- run around
[silence]
really
[silence]
oh wow
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
okay
[silence]
okay
[silence]
okay
[silence]
most definitely
[silence]
yeah yeah [laughter-the] yeah that's a that's a definite security involved in uh in a dog like that
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
wow that's uh
[silence]
yeah that's interesting
[silence]
yeah i kn[ow]- i know our dog has had uh had some different reactions she's never really been around children and uh
if if the child is is pretty straight forward um she's fine i[f]- if a child is a little intimidated she'll jump around and and yip and bark quite a bit and if the child gets scared
uh she's still trying to play but she doesn't completely understand what's going on and we've had a little confusion w[ith]- with uh with younger kids
but uh you know that's it's a matter of exposure really um we uh took her home to uh my family's place in South Dakota
and she was the one that was intimidated then there was about seven kids ranging from about
three years to ten years running around the house all at one time you know come to visit grandpa and grandma and the dog [laughter-kind] kind of felt out of place then because_1 she was she was being fed and everything else from all directions she really didn't know how to handle herself so
[silence]
she really did she just uh she she was alm[ost]- she was just inundated with with all the attention uh she she kind of she kind of sat and and soaked it all in for a little while and then she'd go get back in and try to play and and whatnot but uh
it was it was just su[ch]- such a new experience for her she's only been around one and and sometimes two people at the most so uh
[silence]
uh pardon
oh it's uh Mitzi
yeah
oh okay
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
[laughter-i] see
[silence]
yeah yeah
yeah i had uh i had a similar uh experience i i grew up on a farm so i always had uh outdoor pets
and uh the dog i had when i moved to Dallas about five years ago was a uh Springer Spaniel black Lab cross
and he was a real a real lovable type but uh definitely not an apartment type animal so he uh he had to stay home
yeah yeah it really was it he uh apparently had a tough time with it for a little while then he he got he came to accept the fact that mom and dad were his company from then on but uh
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
okay
most definitely
well that's great
that sounds real good
you too bye
[noise]

[noise]
yes um i was wondering whether you were in favor of statehood independence or the status quo for Puerto Rico
[silence]
well i'm i guess
i don't have su[ch]- such close experience with with um an area becoming a state as you do
um my concern is the economy because as i understand it Puerto Rico has a very low st[andard]- uh standard of living or at least um annual average income
um part of this i suppose is justified in i[n]- in that the climate they don't need perhaps the heating and the housing that some of th[e]- the more northern territories need
however in that case i guess i would favor status quo
i have been to Puerto Rico and and found it very very interesting i did Peace Corps training there
and so um you know i saw it also as a young student and and it was very foreign in a certain sense although i had grown up in California and so the Spanish was no problem
um it was
it was you know very lovely and and the people seemed very friendly and and nice i have actually i work with uh
a girl from Puerto Rico and i guess i have never thought to ask her which she favors
uh
[silence]
well probably more on in terms of the US
um
you know i i'm not quite sure how the US copes
with this sort of thing i've live [abrode/abroad] abroad most of my life so
i guess i i've been very cut off uh i lived actually in Lebanon so i was very cut off from the
the press as i w[as]- you know
and uh bec[oming]- was becoming an adult so i don't know how the US would cope with it a
new state that is so very very poor
um i guess you know we'd have a lot of aid if if you consider the inner cities of
like New York and and how much aid it needs i suppose the whole country or the whole um new state would require such aid
[silence]
i think so
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum yeah th[ose]- those are good points um which obviously [laughter-i'd] never thought about
um
i don't know wh[at]- uh i suppose
they also not being a state are
probably freer to determine their own
um ways of life than they would if if
i- i'm trying to think exactly what is imposed if they would become a state versus a territory
perhaps compulsory education
[silence]
um
and taxes [laughter]
[silence]
um-hum w[ell]- well actually i thin[k]- one one thing that i remember hearing in the news the past couple weeks that might be significant is that
they've recently voted that Spanish is the official language which i always assumed it was anyway
so if they've just taken such action
it would seem to indicate to me either they're doing it because they're afraid they might become a state and want
to declare this before they become a state
or maybe because they don't want to become a state for fear of losing the Spanish or Hispanic heritage
[silence]
i i believe i would probably tend towards that
[silence]
well that's interesting
[silence]
right what about if if um they demanded to have Spanish as the official language
as a condition for statehood
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um
[silence]
um-hum um-hum
[silence]
that's interesting because
although i tend to be bilingual Spanish based on experience
uh
i was in bilingual education in California and
i didn't have any problem with my students but i noticed my
my brother wh[o]- who was uh quite a bit younger
was learning Spanish in elementary school and he can't speak a word
and so obviously it didn't work in California
[silence]
right
[silence]
right
[silence]
oh i see
[silence]
um-hum um-hum
[silence]
o[kay]- okay well thank you very much
bye-bye
[noise]

[noise]
[silence]
i was a
resident although very young of the s[tate]- of what is now the state of Alaska in nineteen fifty nine when Alaska stopped being a territory became a state
uh so i guess i have a left over
positive feeling about the question even though i don't know [laughter-very] much about Puerto Rico
um i know that all the things that happened relative to that territory in Alaska have been very positive uh and i k[ind]- have a suspicion that that i
believe that a that statehood is a good idea whenever you have a territory the size of Puerto Rico one ought either to make it a full-fledged state or or let it go one or the other
what is your situation
[silence]
oh that's very interesting
[silence]
your concern on the economies was one in terms of if it became a state would that put even more pressures on on Puerto Rico or pressures on the US in terms of aid or
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
i guess
um
we're assuming that that Puerto Rico would be per capita significantly more poor perhaps than than say Mississippi or
okay
that's something th[at]- that i guess i have not much of an image of other than
than Puerto Rico as a tropical island and consequently large numbers of barefoot natives or something uh not in a
pejorative sense but in a in a carefree sense i guess although i'm aware of the political problems and unrest and and also difficulties they have
um
i don't know whether state woul[d]- statehood would improve their economy i don't i don't know that the ve[ry]- the act of being a state
would would have any impact on on them uh i guess they would have the ability to do some taxing that they don't have now but of course if their economy is weak that there is not much of a base on which to tax
i don't know if they suffer
in a sense of
income loss as being since they aren't a state whether there are monies that escape them so to speak because they aren't able to tax like a typical state would be
how do you feel though about
well i guess it's to their advantage to be a territory but uh i wonder how hav[ing]- having been in a territory but only as a young student and my parents were in the military at the time so they didn't have ready negative feelings about being in the s[tates]- in the
Alaska at the time since th[ey]- they voted absentee
i i would imagine that it must be a little bit of a se[cond]- feeling of second class citizenry
uh to be in a territory that large and not being able to vote the District of Columbia people for instance are quite frustrated i think at times
in their not having a Senate representative
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
uh i see what you mean so that
[silence]
yeah taxes would undoubtedly be occurring uh there i don't know i don't even understand exactly how taxes are handled in a territorial situation
um
frequently the laws in a territory are are in some ways as stringent as they are in other states i uh and i'm thinking in terms of education but then again each state sets its own and i don't know how a territorial governor takes care of something like Puerto Rico
[silence]
um it's interesting because i haven't thought of them in terms of the problems relative to to uh economy
uh
i had thought of it more in terms of political uh
realization and i guess i had automatically made the assumption that gee anyone would rather be a state of the US than an independent country
so
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
[noise]
[silence]
uh-huh
that's interesting
[silence]
well it sounds as though you are in favor of uh status quo
[silence]
and i think uh having listened to you relative to the economy thing i think if i were being forced to make a decision i would plead ignorance and wait to do more research before picking one of these so i'm ult[imately]- i guess i'm ultimately in favor of status quo also
[silence]
at this point
leaning towards uh statehood
[silence]
i think i would be troubled i suspect i believe that any of our states and i i constitutionally i don't think there are any prescriptions abou[t]- against that decision even if uh Louisiana chose to go with Creole or something
um
i don't think there is any prohibitions i would be bothered by that i'm i'm bothered by any tendency to resist what i think was one of America's strengths and that's the the the melting pot uh i i-
am particularly fond of a number of ethnic cuisines but i'm troubled by too close a clinging to to the past and i'm also realizing that that a common language i think is the ultimate bond of a country
and Canada i guess comes to my mind as they're going through the throes up there relative to French Quebec and whatever uh that i i think that would be
a a negative step to make and i think that that they would need to reassess that
um
i'm troubled even in by bilingualism uh in so far that it intr[udes]- it gets in the way of of of the melting pot aspect
[silence]
hum
[silence]
yeah
but i'm rather in favor of people being bilingual and i'd be quite happy to see a national law in which every student was required to learn English and a second language
but i'm i'm disturbed by a country that attempts to be functionally bilingual at the official level
[silence]
um
i'm i'm concerned about whether or not that causes fractiousness i guess
[silence]
well i think we have gone to time and i appreciate your having called
[silence]
good-bye
[silence]
[noise]

[noise]
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
well yes of course we do have capital punishment and we've you know done away with our quote fair share number
[silence]
yes
[silence]
yes it's certain crimes uh capital crimes murder of course uh rape this sort of thing
[silence]
and it seems to be a disproportionate number of blacks you know that get into the system
[silence]
um-hum yes th[at]-
that happens on occasion it sure does maybe it just depends on you know how closely the crime you know has affected you personally you know i don't know or a person personally
i think i would be [laughter] you know i guess really if i had to say yes or no i guess i would say you know that
i am in certain cases in favor of the death penalty i don't know that it's a big deterrent really i don't know that it is i don't know how we'd ever find out you know really whether it is or not
[silence]
oh yeah oh absolutely yeah it goes on for years and years and costs hundreds of thousands of dollars taxpayer money
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yes
[silence]
yes um-hum
[silence]
yeah it is it's it's a tough tough question it really is
i suspect i would be uh you know a lot more favor of it if you know one of my children were you know brutally killed or something like that like i say i think it depends on how personally affected you know you might be by it
[silence]
oh absolutely
th[at's]-
that's right
[silence]
[noise] not with me personally it is with a lot of other people
it's not not to me personally no
no
[silence]
um-hum
yes
[silence]
that's a it's a tough tough question it really is
[silence]
yes i think most states do have capital punishment yes
[silence]
but i think the US is one of the few countries that still do
[silence]
yes they're only i was reading something about it the other day i think there was only like six or eight countries in the world that have capital punishment still
a lot of them_1 had to have el[ected]- elected not to do so now i don't know what they do in place of it you know maybe it's
life imprisonment or you know something i don't i don't know how they handle it bu[t]-
i was surprised to learn that so few countries have capital punishment
[silence]
oh yeah
[silence]
yes a lot of them_1 do get their sentences commuted to something else
[silence]
yes
[silence]
uh-huh yes
[silence]
[noise] right the first appeal is automatic so
that delays it for a few years just right off the bat
[silence]
there's there's a lot of you know last minute uh [noise]
things that happen cause a person not to have to go through the whole thing
[silence]
yes uh-huh that's that's fairly recent i don't know how recent but fairly recent in the state of Texas before that it was uh death by electrocution
[silence]
yes it certainly does
[silence]
yes it would almost have to be i suppose if you if you had to chose i guess i [laughter-would] i am sure i would take the lethal injection
[silence]
yes absolutely
it's a it's a tough question it really is i guess if i had to say
you know yes or no i would say you know yes i- i would have to lean toward capital punishment you know for certain crimes
[silence]
no i don't think it's a monetary thing i think we hope that it will be you know
some sort of [determent/deterrent] deterrent or you know an eye for an eye type thing or something like that
some of the crimes are just so brutal and so you know useless
[silence]
this may seem to be the best way out i don't know
easiest way out maybe
no i don't think it's a monetary thing
[silence]
yes especially the murder rate its just gone crazy
[silence]
yes absolutely
[silence]
yes i wish i had the answer for that everybody does
[silence]
yes it's nothing to be proud of certainly not
[silence]
yes
so have we been very very fortunate
[silence]
that's right absolutely
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
absolutely
[silence]
uh-huh that's right
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
so would i- i fortunately i have never been in that circumstance i hope i never am like like everybody else
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
right
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
sure it's it's a big responsibility it really is
[silence]
yes
so would i
[silence]
yes absolutely
[silence]
it is it's a tough subject it really is
[silence]
right
[silence]
that's right
[silence]
well thank you it's nice talking to you uh-huh bye bye
[silence]
[noise]

[noise]
well i am new to Texas so i don't even know what the law is in the state do you
[silence]
oh that's right i think now that i recall reading about it in the paper
um you know different things is it restricted to certain crimes or just [noise]
[silence]
um-hum hum
well
[silence]
yes i know the one thing that i think is really sad about it as i recall from the articles that i've read is that if if people who have been there
[noise]
are going to be killed [noise] um there's people that come to the prisons and [noise]
and they're very violent and they want i mean they're anxious for someone to be killed i just i can't see that
[noise]
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
no
[silence]
well there is so many chances for appeal that it kee[p]-
[silence]
yeah it's really sad i don't know i just think um
somehow i hoped that as a people we could be better than than um expecting
the feeling that it right with someone is calling for someone else to be killed you know
[noise] is really kind of bad and
[silence]
hum
[silence]
that's true and there really are criminals that are hard-core and repeat and ne[ver]- never have any chance for
[vocalized-noise] oh i don't know is it do you feel at all like it's a religious issue
[noise]
um-hum
[silence]
hum
i don't know sometimes i feel i mean i do go to church and things i don't know how i would feel about it but like you say if it hit you personally closer at home you would feel feel differently
[silence]
do you think most states have that or
[silence]
um-hum hum
[silence]
that still does it that's right
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
have that well and it doesn't seem like very many people uh are really i mean there's a lot of people that are on death row but there's not very many people that actually um do get killed
[silence]
um-hum
so seems like a lot of people live there and 
through appeals because i know they do frequently i mean they cover cover it pretty heavily on television and the newspaper
if it finally gets to that point
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
so is it uh [noise] are we doing lethal injection now
[silence]
um-hum wh[ich]- which seems so awful
[silence]
so it's a little bit more humane i guess it is
[silence]
[laughter]
yes the other one just seems so terrible
[silence]
hum
[silence]
well do you think that we do it because we want it to deter crime or it's not because we don't want to pay for inmates to stay in prison
um-hum
[silence]
hum
[silence]
yes
[silence]
hum
well um and i notice that the crime rate was up in the Dallas area
[noise] it's
[silence]
and it's kind of been scary to think about it and
you're hoping there is something that will cut down on that
[silence]
you hate to have the dubious honor of being
you know so high in the
in statistics
[silence]
but i you know we have been really fortunate our family hasn't had [noise]
any crime
[silence]
and so we don't
it's harder to think about the poor people that have suffered that way
and how they would expect how they would
hope i mean you you hear of people who have um committed crimes and then they get out of jail and they go and they do the same thing again and you wonder why they can't just stop it
[silence]
so maybe you would
but still i would hate to be on the jury that sentenced someone
[silence]
no [laughter] i know when um we just we moved here um i from the
i got a summons jury summons just
like [laughter-constantly] it seemed like but fortunately i had small children and i didn't have to go and it's not that i mean i think everyone should have to serve on the jury it's just that
i didn't i hate having to be in charge of someone else's life
[silence]
and i would hate to have to hear any kind of case involving a violent crime or anything
that would be really awful
[silence]
well anyway i sure have enjoyed uh [laughter] talking about this although it has been difficult but uh
i'd hate to decide it but i guess um
guess it's important that we decide as a people what what we're going to do
anyway well you have a good day
thank you bye-bye
[noise]

hi how are you doing
[silence]
i said how are you doing
[silence]
yeah we've been doing that too we're trying to retire in our fifties
[noise]
[silence]
good luck on that one then
i said good luck on that one then
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
so you work for TI then
[silence]
you can't say yep
[noise]
yes you do
well i work for DISD and i don't know what you're talking about when you say uh health insurance but Dallas doesn't pay it pays most of mine 
you know now after you work i think five years they begin to pay most of it but then for the the family you know m[y]- i put my kids on my policy it's like two hundred dollars
and it's gone up quite a bit and they predict you know of course it's going to keep going up i wish they could go on and pay for all of our coverage at some point
and benefits you know i'd like to see child care paid for or or on-site ch[ild]- child care sometime
[silence]
i think that would be an excellent idea and it would make women go to work sometimes if they knew their kids were being taken care of they could go visit them during the day
what
[silence]
well we can shelter also monies that we're going to pay in for child care too you know go on and pay a lump sum
and as long as you pay that amount you're okay but if you paid in more than you actually used
and the same thing for insurance what you predict you're going to be paying for insurance
as long as you pay actually pay out that amount of money you're okay but if you pay out
less then you lose that money
i don't like that part but you don't have to do that option if you don't want to
[silence]
and then we got that cafeteria plan do you have that
no you can uh
well you let's see it sh[elters]- it shelters you're money that you pay for insurance
it takes it out of your salary before taxes
[silence]
okay
yeah
but we call it the cafeteria plan i wonder why
i said i wonder [laughter-why]
[silence]
cafeteria
[silence]
[laughter]
maybe so let's see what else can we do changes
what
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
you mean like for health insurance
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
well that's easier done in a company than it is in uh school teaching
[silence]
thank you [noise]
[silence]
i said thank you
we're both school teachers
but it's hard to get rid of a teacher if they're not good
it's almost impossible
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
[vocalized-noise]
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
right
[silence]
well they did away with tenure in teaching a long time ago
you know f[or]- in the public schools
[silence]
it made you ea[se]- more at ease you know you knew you weren't going to lose your [laughter-job] unless you really did something horrendous
[silence]
[noise]
[noise] right
[silence]
well they don't
[silence]
in some places they don't
do they
[silence]
you know
[silence]
yeah [laughter]
[silence]
what did you get your degree in 
[silence]
and what's your job now
[noise]
huh
[silence]
maybe
all right what else could we change
[noise] oh i'd like to see flexible hours and teaching you know shared job sharing
more of that
[silence]
well see we've got a little bit of it but not much
and it'd be nice if your you had full insurance coverage if you were doing job sharing
[silence]
what else i'd like to be able to to evaluate your boss
and it really carry some weight and you get to choose your boss
[silence]
huh
[silence]
well so you get to evaluate him though why not
[silence]
no
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
[vocalized-noise]
[noise]
[silence]

[silence]
uh i couldn't hear you
[silence]
i'm doing fine i'm just uh
[silence]
editing a spreadsheet right now i'm trying to figure out how i can retire without having to work -[un]til i'm ninety five
[laughter]
yeah thi[s]-
[silence]
yeah this is a a very appropriate topic for our uh conversation today because
what i'm figuring out is that i'm going to have to put in a lot more money than what i'm making
[laughter]
[silence]
what's that
[silence]
well
we've got a pretty good situation uh my wife and i since our property's already paid for
you know the main things that i like about the uh the job benefits
would be the uh [noise] the availability of the health insurance
[silence]
and the availability of uh you know being able to transfer
around inside the organization
without having you know when they cut off a system and they don't just can everybody that's working on it like some companies i know of
you know they give you an opportunity to transfer into uh an on going project
[silence]
yep
what
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
well
[silence]
yeah that's uh that's something i hadn't really thought about since we don't have children
but i can see how it would be a real benefit
those that do
[silence]
hum
[silence]
well that can i can see where that might be important
[silence]
no
i i don't know what you're talking about there
[silence]
oh okay yeah yeah we got that pre tax insurance
yeah
[vocalized-noise]
[silence]
hum
oh it's probably what the first guy who did it called it
yeah he was probably in the cafeteria when he thought of [laughter-it]
[laughter]
[silence]
i'll tell you what we could do
we could prohibit people from being hired that are
historically going to cost the company money
you know do a little bit better research on who gets hired
because you know i[f]-
well no[t]- not only just health insurance i mean for the whole benefit of the company
see i look at it this way if the company folds i got to go find a job
okay now if we get somebody in a position to affect the way the company performs just about anybody in the company
and they're not doing their job or they're not capable of doing their job then we should find
a a place to put them_1 or b you know boot them_1 out
[silence]
well frankly i think school teachers ought to get about ten times what they're getting paid
[silence]
what
oh well
i'm i'm
[silence]
i know
[silence]
well there's two schools of thought on that you know i i'm looking at trying to get into a university job position as a professor
i got about eight years of education ahead of me before i can do that
but
once you get that job with the university then you've got ten years of probation
then you have tenure
and they can't fire you
well you know in a situation like that i don't know if that's good or bad i do know that i've had tenured professors that were just sorry
and i've also had tenure professors that were the best things on two legs
[silence]
but in addition
um-hum
[silence]
well they they really can't fire you without cause anymore i mean you know the government's taken care of that
but uh what i'm looking at is
you know
there are a lot of teachers out there that aren't getting paid what they need to be getting paid and there are some teachers out there that aren't worth having around as janitors
you know and i could see a point protecting someone's position
but on the other hand i don't think it you know that someone that teaches uh say shop for instance should have to have a a degree at all
[silence]
well
[silence]
in some places they don't but you know you you've got specialized education now
for instance take computer science
you know we've got kids twenty years old
right now that could beat any computer
professor at microcomputer applications i know we do
and these people can't even get jobs doing anything besides digging ditches
because there's no comprehensive test that they can take
that would allow them to s[tep]- to step into that position without having to go through the rigamarole of college
you know i went to college late on in life and i realize that hey you know it's nothing but four years of endurance and you might be teachable you know what i [laughter-mean]
[laughter]
i mean my degree is absolutely worthless 
it's my experience and and my knowledge that that is beneficial but then you know i like i said i came at it backwards
[silence]
Industrial Marketing
[silence]
well actually i'm selling computer software
but the two are mutually exclusive
because the
it's experience that got me the job that i got now was my experience in the construction field prior to going to college
not my degree
which is i think kind of {bizzaro}
[silence]
well let's
[silence]
that's
we've already we've already got that
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
well yeah
supervisor evaluation's always been a tough one
especially in my line because
you know my supervisor has got really absolutely nothing to do with my job except make sure i get my check
[laughter]
[silence]
well not really
you know i mean i[t]- there's
what what's to [evalu/evaluate] -[evalu]ate him on
you know i mean
uh my my supervisory level is like practically zero
i run the whole show
and when i need something i tell my boss and he gets it for me because_1 he knows that i know what i'm doing
you know and uh
that that is something that i think needs to be expanded on specially in the in the large market place you know the major corporation
because so often you know you get a guy who's got eight or nine or ten people working for him in separate areas so to speak
[silence]
you know it's it's hard for me to y[ou]- you know especially since i'm in marketing sales
you know i make more than my boss [noise]
because he's salary and i'm not i make as much as i earn
you know if i don't make a sale i don't make anything
[laughter]
[silence]
yeah well it's a little tough
but uh you know there are you know requirements and and quotas and what not for me to make
but uh bottom line on on that kind of thing is
you know we have a lot of people especially in major corporations who aren't doing a damn thing
they're just there
you know the work they do could be totally eliminated and not that they aren't working not that they aren't trying or anything but it's just that their jobs are useless
[silence]
you know take for instance um a large construction company i used to work for
Ed Swampers Swampers' a guy who's in the union he's a laborer and he's assigned to

[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
oh
[silence]
that's very spicy too
i mean these bell peppers and curry
[silence]
oh that sounds really good
huh i guess it was is this dinner time for you
[silence]
all done in advance
[silence]
that's um [noise] i uh i'm i'm not that great a cook but i was single until i was thirty so i did cook a little you know
[silence]
uh and i cook a little bit now what i like to do mostly is stir fries and my wife normally says oh Tom why why don't you make a stir fry tonight
so we even we just were recently married so we have a stir fry pan sort of like a big wok
and we do a lot of um stir fry vegetables
[silence]
it's it's called a stir fry pan and it and it fits right on your uh si[t]- it fits right on your burner whether it's gas or electric so it's it has a flatter bottom than a normal wok does
and um normally what happ[en]- what we do is um just you know like two tablespoons of oil maybe sesame oil or some other type of oil than just regular
oi[l]- vegetable oil but i will use peanut peanut oil or things and then we just stir fry broccoli and carrots and um green peppers and um
maybe put in a little bit of um garlic and ginger uh beforehand that gives uh uh uh spicier flavor
and then after the stir fry is over just mix in um
a little bit of uh sometimes chicken broth and corn starch and soy sauce and that sort of makes a uh a glaze
that sticks to the the vegetables i've used you turn them over a lot of times when we do stir fry we just put in tofu we don't put in meat
cause i guess we're i'm not but uh she likes to watch all the how much red meat and things so we'll do a lot of times vegetarian
but it's a real good meal because you have squash and broccoli and uh carrots and celery and green peppers and um oh gee mushrooms
it's it's a pretty big and we put that over rice
[silence]
oh you don't [laughter]
[silence]
oh
[silence]
uh-huh
yeah see we never in fact i never had squash growing up my my wife eats more vegetables ate more vegetable than i did growing up i'm i'm from Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh is a very meat and potato town
yeah recipes in Pittsburgh consisted of red meat and a potato
red meat and a potato
[silence]
oh she had all of those types of vegetables
see never no vegetables in my family
yeah it was really funny
[silence]
[laughter] well that was a real farm
[silence]
no but i i've i've heard stories uh i've heard stories
[silence]
uh
[silence]
oh this is terr[ible]- you shouldn't be talking about this right before while you're fixing dinner
[silence]
that's right you should be careful [laughter] that's pretty funny but my dad used to tell stories you know about the way they eat chickens but i never we never we lived in the suburbs we we bought everything in a grocery store
there was no but it was funny you know it so but when we got married you know a lot more vegetables a lot more you know a lot of changes
[silence]
i think so too
[noise]
but we just went shopping and we came back with uh with uh sweets you know chocolate covered peanuts
[noise]
we came back with sweets we didn't bring all the healthy food back too
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
well that's that's supposed to be um the trend of the future
but uh the cut back i uh recently was over a friends house that's Indian and uh
she had brought Indian sweets into the office and it was really funny because they were made from yogurt and carrots
yeah that was a sweet and i was like ugh
[silence]
this is a sweet oh it is it's a candy i'm like ugh you know Indian candy is not very good
but everything was and everything you didn't notice it at first but everything was sort of hot everything had a little bit of curry in it
it was funny even the sweets did
when you first took a bite of them you didn't notice it but then after a couple of minutes you could taste it you know it had that that after taste that very it was a very Indian flavor
good they didn't have i didn't like her desserts very well
they were very yogurt and carrots and pin pistachios pistachio nuts and yogurt
and it wasn't very good
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah well have we done our ten minutes
[silence]
something like that i think we're
[silence]
no nor[mally]- normally they just come in and they say you've overextended your
your conversation
[silence]
oh okay well that's you'll see it will normally it will come on and it'll say you've over extended your conversation you now have fifteen minutes to compl[ete]- fifteen seconds to complete it
but uh i've been cut off twice
so i just thought in fact i'm just also i'm hearing a siren outside i think my my neighbors car must have got bumped you know he has one of those alarms on his car
one of the the neighbor has an alarm on a car and it's going off
so i was going to go out and see what they were doing
[silence]
okay hey thanks so much
[silence]
uh-huh and you said this was your fi[rst]- well you'll you'll get a couple more probably
i uh i called yesterday i or Friday maybe i talked to somebody that uh
i got them on uh during the day it was a housewife and she was home with two kids
and while we're talking the kids are screaming in the background you know that they wanted something and they were arguing back and forth and she just kept talking the whole time it was pretty funny
[silence]
okay
hey thanks a lot i'll talk to you later
bye
[noise]

[silence]
okay in order to make the uh curried chicken i just fried the chicken
until it was nice and brown you know make sure it's nice and brown on both sides and then you take it out of the fat and you you let the chicken you fried kind of drain so that a lot of the oil comes out of it
and then you you uh pour most of the all of the oil out of the pan and you kind of clean it out and you put back maybe two tablespoons full of the oil
and saute some um bell peppers and onions in in that little bit of oil maybe one tablespoon or two tablespoons let that brown then put all of the chicken back in there
and then you uh mix flour and a cup of water maybe uh one tablespoon of flour and a cup of water stir it real real well
[silence]
then you uh pour that in there you know to make the gravy
and you let it come to a boil again and then you let it simmer and you add uh about a tablespoon of what i'm using now is Jamaican curry powder
and that's going to it's going to be really good [laughter]
yeah it's
right and then if you like it really hot you can add some hot hot peppers and hot sauce and all that kind of stuff
yeah
[silence]
uh well
it will be in a little while i'm trying to get it get it ready early

and i'd just be
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
oh that sounds good we we were from North Carolina and we had a garden and my mother would would uh grow the squash and she'd grow white potatoes and onions and cabbage and collards and all kinds of
right
[silence]

you wouldn't believe it we even raised chickens [laughter] you ever seen anybody kill a chicken
no [laughter]
[laughter] and they put the head under a tin tub and chop the head off
and then you hear the chicken jumping around under the tub and finally it dies down you get just a little patter and then it

yeah thank you it was nice talking with you
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
ugh
[silence]
yeah kind of hard that way
okay
all right thank you bye-bye
[noise]

[noise]
yes i saw Home Alone with some friends just a couple days ago i wanted to see it uh because it was uh
much recommended
uh for months and months and months and it was a a genre that i wasn't in the least bit interested in and i usually when i hear about a movie that's supposed to be very good
even if it's in a genre i don't like i figure well i should go see it because if this is you know the best of the genre and i should know about it or something like that and i usually come away thinking no i really don't like this [laughter-show] [laughter]
[laughter]
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah yeah 
well the the problem i had with the movie was the problem i've had with a lot of uh i guess Hollywood movies which is you know it's a formula movie and they're making the movie according to a certain formula that's a good formula but they seem to 
fall short of
of being really creative with a lot of things i mean here's the situation of this kid at home you know it's a classic slapstick situation with these bungling burglars trying to get in
and yeah he did some clever things but given the size of the house and how clever the kid was it seems to me they could have done a lot more 
i mean you know ba[sically]- basically stepping on things and yelling in pain and it seems to me they could have been a lot more creative stuff used 
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh uh-huh
[silence]
well i guess it was a uh a very successful movie financially so we may say [laughter-more] [laughter-slapstick] [laughter]
[silence]
yeah it is it is and i guess you don't have to but you know if you look at
oh have you ever seen any of the Jacques Teti Teti movies the French movies uh Teti it it
[silence]
um
[silence]
no i'm not with you so far [laughter]
[silence]
[laughter]
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
aha 
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
oh yeah
[silence]
they have they have a long [vocalized-noise] yes they like Jerry Lewis much to the chagrin of sophisticated Ame[rican]- quote unquote sophisticated American record company but they have this one guy Jacques Teti that does slapstick comedy and there's something about it
that's so innovative you know he'll have trouble picking up his hat or catching his umbrella blowing in the wind or something but there's something about it that just it isn't just slapstick there's something about the human character in it
and that's what i find lacking in a lot of you know like Home Alone
there was a lot of the human character when he was home alone and he was trying to be tough and they s had a lot of human character there but when it was the real slapstick moments him versus the criminals kind of thing it just sort of lost the human element became purely a caricature 
does does that make since to you
[noise]
yeah yeah did you go with kids though
did you go with kids
did you take kids along
[silence]
ah
oh i would have liked to have a kid with me i think preferably someone seven or eight just just to get a sense for you know how how it affected them
especially to come home and you know [laughter] [vocalized-noise] [laughter-if] [laughter-he] [laughter-didn't] [laughter-knock] [laughter-real] [laughter-loudly] [laughter-and] [laughter-clearly] i would have gotten in trouble the next day i'm sure
[silence]
oh Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles huh um-hum 
um-hum 
[silence]
and your cousin's a kid
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah wasn't it amazing
[silence]
yeah those
yeah it was all bloodless and the good guys can get hit all day long and they have to shake it off they don't they don't you know get [vocalized-noise] epileptic fits or anything from getting hit on the head
yeah it it's a little disturbing
the violence in these films part[ly]- it mean it's supposed to be a little bit more okay because it's comic book but on the other hand it makes it seem like
i i read an article one time talking about even the quote unquote realistic movies don't have very realistic effects of the violence the violence can seem very realistic but the aftermath is usually not there
if you see people who are severely injured it's
very very badly they lose control of body functions they thrash around they scream you know uh it's just a very very bad thing and they never present that even the movies that want to show violence as real they don't really show you what happens with that real violence
and i'm not really sure how i feel about that
uh on the one hand i'd like it to be a warning on the other hand i wouldn't want people who currently get sort of enjoy their violence fixes from these movies to start thinking gee now we want to see the aftermath all the time either
[silence]
but yeah T[eenage]- Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is sort of the same way they i guess they figured i mean they know what they're doing and they make the movies good enough i guess i'm a bit of a snob they make the movies good enough to be successful 
and then they don't and they but they could make them better you know they could try to make i mean as far as i was concerned Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles could have been a classic of world theater
[vocalized-noise] it could have been you know it was it was innovative uh a completely new approach to making a movie in a lot of ways and yet it ended up not being anything particularly memorable
cause the the story was stupid and and then things like that and uh they built up i remember feeling annoyed
again i didn't have a kid with me
and i remember feeling annoyed that they had this whole thing about the master and the passing of wisdom the from older to younger generation it was it was a classic Greek you know it's European mess going back three thousand years that they're playing with
um and he had to pa[st]- and he told them remember [vocalized-noise] remember you
[vocalized-noise] united you can succeed individually you will fail and then there was a big climactic fight scene and they didn't remember that
they didn't fight together they fought individually and they failed individually and then that was it then they had to have the master beat him
and the master should according to the classic myth the sort of Joseph Campbell type myth
the master should have died at the end because the the lesson was passed to the young generation and the older generation is not needed and is reborn to the younger generation and on and on and on and all this wonderful myth
and it still would have been every bit as accessible a movie for the kids
if they had included all this stuff that
i anyway as an as intellectual adult would appreciate it wouldn't have hurt the movie to do that and it would have make it uh
broadened the audience that it could have been targeted for i thought
but i um i'm i'm clearly enough you know i'm i'm clearly an intellectual snob to be going to these kinds of movies i realize that
i mean to go to these movies and expect them to be you know other than just just good entertainment kind of thing
[silence]
yeah yeah i i i i'm very i'm very critical [noise] i i i'm actually originally from Hollywood and then then then and my father works in films and such and i tend to
tend to be hypercritical of these things and then perhaps perhaps it's unfair because i i i must admit i enjoy these movies um
and th[at]- that's what they're for
but i don't don't remember them
and i think it's i think i can think of movies i have less fun during and then after the movie's over i remember it so terribly well because it it had some some meaning to me or something
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
yeah yeah they leave the
yeah they leave they leave some songs with you they leave i don't know what it is
but it just
i mean i don't know if this is old fart talking here or something because_1 i'm not that old [laughter] [laughter-i] [laughter-look] you know those old movies seemed to have had something that uh that was memorable somehow i don't know what it was
[silence]
okay well um [laughter] thanks for hearing me ramp i guess [laughter] all right nice talking with you
okay
no i'm in California
so they're paying the phone bill
yeah there must be Texas people as near as i can tell no okay i'm from the other coast all right bye bye

[noise]
[silence]
[laughter]
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah right uh-huh
[silence]
[laughter]
yeah i uh i i i feel that way when movies are like blown up out of proportion you know usually people tell you how good they are and you always
you know end up with expectations too high or whatever
right
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah uh-huh
[silence]
right
[silence]
yeah [laughter]
[silence]
yeah i was very surprised that did do a slapstick movie because that's uh not really the way comedies are right now
you know a lot of the comedies are more like jokes and you know gags and stuff like that there's not as much slapstick anymore
[silence]
uh-huh
yeah that well that's true it's very cheap to make a slapstick movie
[silence]
excuse me
no not really the last movie i saw i guess uh was uh
uh the one about the the French the Frenchman that leaves and comes back and he's someone different um
he's uh uh well it's about a man uh
that uh leaves his home and comes back to his wife and his wife's all excited but the guy that comes back is not her original husband
but um
[vocalized-noise] Gear um i'm sure you've heard of it it was a very famous uh popular movie Norman Gray Norman Gear
um
oh shoot i'm going to hit myself after i hang up i'll remember the name
but uh anyway that was a French movie it was um that was the last one i saw downtown but i i live in DC well actually Falls Church Virginia outside the city
and uh so a lot of times they the the the international films downtown
but uh so this uh French i guess are into the slapsti[ck]- i guess so they would like Jerry Lewis yeah [laughter]
[noise]
right
[silence]
oh uh-huh
[silence]
right
[silence]
um-hum
right
yeah uh-huh
yeah i see what you're saying there is less character development rather just the the the funniness of the gag rather than
and how it fits with the character right
[noise] excuse me
no we went uh without the kids it's was a a night out
away from the children
[silence]
oh
[silence]
[laughter]
[noise] oh
[silence]
uh-huh
yeah that that's true i i was thinking about that too i saw that um
that's why i watched another silly movie um [noise] um with my my cousin was uh uh the one about the um the turtles
[silence]
right yeah i saw that with my cousin just to see what you know what the kids are into
and that is yeah he's a little yeah he's anyway and that was just
excessively violent i was [laughter-worried] it's like golly if kids start imitating that
they'll knock each others blocks off
uh-huh
[silence]
um-hum 
yeah
[silence]
right
[noise]
[silence]
[noise]
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
right
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
yeah right
uh-huh
yeah it's true
yeah
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
[laughter-really]
[silence]
uh-huh
[noise]
yeah right oh
[silence]
[laughter]
[silence]
right
[silence]
right
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
[laughter]
[silence]
right
that's true
yeah there's not too many that are uh that are good just on their you know that that you wouldn't want to change something and there's always something that uh
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
oh really
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah right
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
right
exactly yeah there there there are a couple movies that hit home like that most of the ones i always remember are the the older ones
i always like the musicals and uh those ones uh those stick in your head
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
no it could be
[laughter]
[silence]
uh-huh
um
okay well i guess i got to get going got to go take care of the children
[laughter]
yeah nice talking with you are you calling from Texas by the way
oh okay the first person i've talked to outside of Texas
[silence]
yeah okay well thank you very much bye bye
[noise]

[noise]
okay we're rolling
i uh what what would you what would has your experience lead you to advise uh if my child were thinking of going to the Air Force Academy what would you say
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum um-hum um-hum how do you feel about it must be a somewhat different environment from a regular college how does that uh
how do you feel that is for someone at at that phase in their life
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
um-hum um-hum um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
[laughter]
[silence]
well i sort of one of the reasons it's taken so long is i've been working
uh you know it's sort of half student half working and source of income and stuff so i'm actually managing to do this with zero debt
uh i couldn't you you couldn't do it otherwise
[silence]
yeah i think if there's any major piece of advice i'd give is to find a way of getting an education that doesn't incur that kind of debt
it's not i mean i remember seeing an article one time about you know if the average person who spent that much money going to college just took the same amount of money and put it in a a in an investment fund 
they'd be considerably wealthier than they would be from the [laughter] job they'd get after college so it's it's really kind of crazy
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
really
huh
[silence]
yes yes i know i was actually i th[ink]- i was thinking of trying to get a job there i heard of it
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
[laughter]
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
um-hum um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
yeah yeah
[silence]
well my my real feeling about
about the purpose of undergraduate education is
it's really the time yes you do get an education you do learn some things but you eventually forget most of it
but what you don't forget is the growing up it's really the period when people become adults
i mean people who don't go to college become adults in other ways but really it's the entry into adulthood i think and i think that the best way to choose a college is to decide what kind of environment you want to
be fostered in as you become
you know as you gain new social skills as you become you know more of a functioning member of society
and maybe the Air Force Academy is appropriate as you said for someone who you know a more you know who needs to learn self-discipline and so forth would be appropriate for them
[silence]
yeah and want to develop that
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum um-hum um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
um-hum
[silence]
the same patterns of behavior you mean yeah yeah
[silence]
exactly it's kind i find it kind of sad i really do
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
right
[silence]
um-hum um-hum yeah in high school everyone sort of tries to have the same opinion [laughter-it] [laughter-seems]
[laughter]
yeah the the one thing i think that's no good for anyone is these monster institutions these institutions of th[irty]- thirty thousand students
[vocalized-noise] and i see some freshmen wandering around in there and they're
they're just like you know someone from the country lost in the big city i mean they
they i don't see them getting
i mean when i was undergraduate i went to a relatively small school for my first two years and then i transferred to a very large school
and that worked out pretty well i went from a you know a second rate institution to a higher rate institution
but the first couple of years it doesn't matter to me what the quality of the education was i needed to make friends i needed to sort of learn the ropes you know there were things like that that mattered a lot more and i needed basic really simple education that you can get
pretty much anywhere for the first couple of years
yeah yeah exactly and if you're alienated
i mean i see people at supposedly really good universities who are just having such psychological problems that you think this isn't sinking in
[noise]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah yeah
[silence]
yeah it's sort of a a rare select environment [laughter]
[noise]
[laughter]
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
right right sure
[silence]
yeah it's a top rated institution and now i
[silence]
um-hum um-hum
[silence]
well i
i had known a lot of undergraduates who pick
schools because they want the best reputation for a school not realizing that the reputation for MIT is because of the of the doctorate research
and the professors who go there and you're not going to see the professors [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter-you're] [laughter-going] [laughter-to] see some TA you know uh
so they put they they want you know they want the best and they don't think they think what the best is is reputation for for research and that's a one standard but it's not relevant to what they need
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
um-hum um-hum
[silence]
right
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
hm 
yeah you won't get that at MIT or Berkeley or anything like that and you can and you know you can't blame the professors either because you look at their job description you'd see you know teaching is third down on the list of importance things and
yeah and and that's appropriate if the university is trying to do serious research because it's hard to be a researcher and a teacher at the same time
so i'd say go to a go to a college that has teachers people who really are committed to the students and can afford to be because that's their job
[silence]
but oh well [laughter]
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]

[noise]
[silence]
well i'd encourage it
it's a good general e[ducation]- ed[ucation]- education for a
a bachelor's degree
and obviously and obviously it's where they don't have a
any post graduate program there but you get a
an excellent
wide
uh basis of topics you know you get a good broad education out of it you don't they don't graduate the best engineers or the best English majors but
maybe a graduate pretty good overall students out of there
um
[silence]
well the
for some people it's good because they maybe they need a little discipline need a little reining in at that
that stage in their life uh other people it uh it's
uh suffocating you know you kind of choke on it um
it it depends on the person on the individual but uh the one factor i think
more than anything else in this day and age that's got to
be a big factor in your decision's just the the cost of
how much you're gonna pay
no matter where you go to school
and if you've been in for twelve years i'm sure you've you've got a your share of student loans that uh you're
probably going to be paying off or have been or
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
oh that's good
[silence]
oh yeah i mean i know people that graduated
or that i went to high school with that went to civilian colleges and they they've got twenty thirty thousand dollar debts i mean you could have uh
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
exactly
[silence]
it's it's staggering when you think that just
here in central New York is uh Hamilton College is just a few miles south of you know maybe about twenty miles to the south
from where i am and uh
they're looking for twenty two thousand dollars for tuition and room and board now
a year
at just a small
i mean they they they are s[elect]- it is a select college
[silence]
oh yeah but you're talking incredible tuitions now i don't know how many people actually pay the whole shot very few i would imagine but uh
i get i- i just couldn't ima[gine]- i mean it's more money than i make in a year so [laughter] you know it you know me being one person with a above the median
income for New York state you know i'm a s[econd]- i'm a second lieutenant in the Air Force now and uh
i e[ven]- even as a
somebody making twice what i was making how could you
put half of that into
to your child's education and then just when they make made make it to the college years it's
my God i can't imagine
[silence]
yes
[silence]
i'd
[silence]
or
or it's also a good environment it may be good for someone who already has self-discipline who has a certain amount of
leadership quality in their own
and that yeah the s[ame]- it's the same it can benefit different people different ways but uh
you know i- i agree with that because_1 i see people
that i know a again from high school that i still keep in touch with that didn't go to college and 
they do the same old things they did in high school
and
same patterns of behavior same
uh same socializing same exact crowd that they hang with and it's like it's like frozen time [laughter-you] [laughter-know]
[silence]
it is it really is that they haven't found anything anything better that
um or their experiences haven't been broadened at all that you know its a
[silence]
it's a tremendous thing when you sit in a in a college environment and discuss some issues and really sit there with people with disagreeing opinions and you hear
all these different sides of the story
that you never thought of
and uh that's another big thing i think people get out of college is the appreciation for
different point differing points of view you know or different opinions
[silence]
yeah exactly
yeah
[silence]
oh i
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
right
[silence]
well your education's a lot what you make of it too so
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
well i i've seen more graduates from MIT and that being
i work in a in a labora[tory]- an Air Force laboratory and so we've got a lot of uh
MIT graduates that are in there
and they are the biggest collection of screwed up people that [laughter-i] [laughter-think] [laughter-i've] [laughter-ever] [laughter-run] [laughter-into] even even more so
uh like military academy grads are a strange lot too i- i mean i have to ad[mit]- confess to that
yeah and they they have their own quirks and tolerances and
you know
certain things that don't bother us at all that would drive other people nuts and then certain things that ways things we do the way we do it that drive other people nuts that
but these MIT grads are off in their absolute own world it it's a
i- i have more re[spect]- i have a lot of respect for MIT master's and doctorate uh
degrees but but their undergrads are like
i i'm amazed at at that's a lot of them_1 even graduated
but uh
i don't know
[silence]
right
[silence]
right
[silence]
nope
[silence]
the [vocalized-noise]
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
no
it's interesting that you mention that i didn't think about that before when you were talking but the service academies have all
all the faculty uh for the most part is is military with a few exchange
instruct professors from other
schools but
uh having the military faculty is really beneficial because they see it as
doing their job and spending time with the cadets there uh is investing in the Air Force and it or the the military itself it's the future officer corps and so
i hear horr[or]- horror stories from 
friends of mine that they could never see their instructors they could never get extra help
for me any time i needed extra help any time of the day
i had all my instructors home phone numbers and could call them you go to their office anytime i had some instructors that uh
would invite me over to their house for extended
study things on weekends when i was having trouble with something and
[silence]
no no and that
[silence]
no
[laughter-right] right publish first and then [laughter]
[silence]
right
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah it's there's a lot of factors that people
don't ever ever consider
in in their selection of a college and uh i don't know maybe
i wonder if if they enter these conversations that people have been having um that

[noise]
so i guess a good question to ask is do you do your own work or do you do you like to do it
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah so do you have a do you have a garden or do you just do your landscaping now and your lawn
[silence]
well that's pretty good my my sister is very over zealous too she's got
some really nice flowerbeds she puts a lot of time into them_1 this is my first year in a in a house where i
thinking about doing some flowerbeds and stuff
oh we i've always had crude ones at my father's but this is the first time that i really have to landscape a house his house is more like a farmhouse its not on a main road
my house is on a main road and it has nothing [laughter] i mean nothing [laughter] but uh what i do do is now i've always done it at my father's house
we have my sister and i have a couple of gardens i think we figured out total
um
this is for vegetables about two thirds of an acre so we each have a third of an acre we do
that's a lot
[laughter]
[silence]
yeah well it's my dad's and we've had it for ov[er]- he's been there for a long time so
um it just happens they built a shopping center next to it [laughter] but um they put up a nice fence so we still have a lot of privacy
and we grow a lot of food
uh i enjoy it
um the gardens are kind of old you have to step down in them_1 now that the
and we've tilled them_1 so much but they're still
we we my sister uses plenty of fertilizer i don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing
boy i wish this phone would stop screeching
yes
i'm trying i don't know if it's my phone
this is bad it's not getting any better
[silence]
oh okay
i don't see i don't think my phone really does that
but every time i have this phone is a little weird i mean it's been dropped on the floor a hundred times
[silence]
yeah i was beating on the phone going can you hear me so
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah we we grow a lot of um the basic c[orn]- corn potatoes [vocalized-noise]
she likes to really get into her pumpkins and see how many she can grow ba[sic]- corn potatoes and uh
acorn squash are good winter keepers
i mean things the way we grow are carrots and uh cabbage that sort of more less goes to waste you know we eat it we just too much she she starts her own plants she plants a lot of tomatoes
i let her do a lot of the planting and putting and i- i do a lot of the uh
a lot of the the ba[ck]- the back work and stuff but she does she helps me a lot too she puts a lot of financial she plans it all out
beans like to be near certain types of plants now they they find that tomatoes don't do well if you put them next to something like uh peas i don't know something
[silence]
no it's just like something like an onion and a tomato would go together but you're not supposed to put your onions near your beans i guess it's
it it's just what scents it gives off they just don't like each other
i mean [laughter] she she reads all kinds of books so i wish i knew more to tell you why but
[silence]
they
yeah [laughter]
[silence]
oh that's really weird
[silence]
i will put i've put my uh
cucumbers are down at one end of the garden and like
like i'll make an L shape i've put cantaloupe so they've been pretty close together
but i don't think the vines they don't really they don't have to be touching or anything like you say they cross pollinate just by bees 
[silence]
oh
i know
[silence]
some something weird
this year we didn't this last season it was it was too wet up here
we lost a lot of oh uh root things our oh uh our squash and our potatoes and we got half our yield it was really bad because_1 of the water
[silence]
y[eah]- yeah
[silence]
yeah i- i have to do that i want to make some flowerbeds and i'm going to have a seven yard truck come in
with some topsoil
and i'm going to a my problem is i want to use those railroad ties to build up a planter but i don't know if the creosote in the railroad ties is going to do something 
to uh you know if i want to grow a tomato or something in there [laughter] i- i mean i guess it'd go for my flowers but
[silence]
yeah i don't i don't i just don't think you i always thought i'd put a tomato plant in there or something weird but i don't think i could really eat the fruit off it without wondering
and i don't know if they make landscape ties that aren't treated
[silence]
yeah but they put some kind of
chemicals in there too
[silence]
yeah well i'm not really worried about it it's mainly for flower bed so i'm not going to not goi[ng]- i'm just not going to put that tomato plant in there 
but i yeah i do want to have a raised bed i've never i my flower gardens have always been like on the ground
they don't
it just looks so much better when it's up against the house tiered up
[silence]
yeah this house that i have is just a three bedroom ranch and i can tell you there's nothing around it cement foundation all the way round it not a shrub not a bush
there was a lilac tree and the landlord cut it down and
said yep that's one thing you have to do summer keep that lilac bush cut down so it doesn't rub up against the siding and i'm looking at him like jeez people would kill to have a lilac bush
and he's cutting it down [laughter] so that's all right flower beds are all right anything as long as it doesn't rub up against the siding
yep that's what he's worried about the trees or a bush because lilac bushes they they grow fast
some people uh would really like to have them_1 and then the people that do have them_1 they spread and they sprout all over th[eir]- their lawn
so they're kind of a pain but you know people who don't have them_1 think they're great and people who do have them_1
cur[se]- curse
another thing i have that um is weird is these a locus tree in the backyard as a matter of fact there's three of them very badly trimmed they aren't trimmed at all
and i can imagine if i had to mow the lawn in the back which we said we'd do
if the trees hang down so low and the locus trees have like three quarters of an inch thorns [laughter-on] [laughter-it] so
[silence]
they're a pretty tree but you just when you walk up to them_1 they're covered with thorns so we're going to get a chain saw and we're going to limb limb it extensively so it the trees up overhead
[silence]
yeah [laughter] because i can just see brushing up against it that it would rip your skin it's worse than a r[ose]- a rose bush
many times worse because_1 of course it's a tree
[silence]
yep my uh dad used to work on them_1 so i don't think i'll have a problem my husband will have problem borrowing one
[laughter] even
[silence]
well if that's not the problem it


[noise]
[silence]
yeah well i um
about a or just over a year ago i bought my
my own house so this has been the first opportunity i've had to uh be working on my own lawn and garden and uh you know
back when i was a kid you know mom would send me out to weed the garden i i'd hate it you know now i sort of take pride in uh in the yard and you know how the how the place looks and uh so i don't mind doing it so much anymore
[silence]
well it's yeah it's it's primarily just uh like landscaping a little bit you know i've got some uh bushes around the fou[ndation]- you know the foundation planting things like that and then there's some uh
uh just some little flowerbeds and my mom grows she's an avid gardener and she starts her own stuff from seed now and uh
she gets a little over zealous when she is planting these seeds in the winter time and and starting them_1 uh
she ends up with so many plants that she can't fit them_1 all in her garden they have a huge yard and a huge house and so she brings them_1 up here from Philadelphia and gives me all her extras
yeah
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
jeez that's a that's more than 
that's more than than the property i have right here that you've got as a uh a garden that's amazing
[silence]
right
[silence]
oh jeez 
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[noise]
are you getting a lot of static on your end of the line
[silence]
yeah i can't even hear what you're
jeez it's gone 
[silence]
well i- i don't know there was well whatever it was there was a second there i couldn't even hear what you were saying but um
[silence]
yeah i guess i was having a hard time there too i thought it sounded well
guess we better stick to the subject for the benefit of the people uh uh doing this work but um
yeah i mean that's a uh heck of a plot you must have uh a lot of different stuff you get out of it especially up in Vermont there you should have uh some really nice soil
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
oh really is because_1 of like the cross pollination or 
[silence]
huh
[silence]
what
[silence]
huh my mom uh
put uh cantaloupes and cucumbers
near each other once and they got cross pollinated by the bees 
and we ended up with these these like
things on the cantaloupe vines that i mean were looked like round big huge round cucumbers
and
and yeah i mean there these were like some mutant [laughter]
[silence]
huh
[silence]
no it's just the like the bees and insects will do it
um either that or my mom just had some bad seed or something
yeah
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
oh well
[silence]
yeah when i uh
my family used to live in Littleton Massachusetts and when we moved in there we had a uh really wet
backyard and uh my mom wanted a vegetable garden so we trucked in uh
i think it was seven
what was it cubic seven yards cubic yards i think that's how they measure dirt but
yeah seven yards of sand i got to shovel it all
lots of fun [laughter]
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
sure
[silence]
right
well it seems
i've seen a lot of people use them_1 you know for flowerbeds but i don't know what whether they'd have creosote would
do anything i mean
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
well you can get um you can get pressurized lumber
oh that's right there's even there's bad chemicals in those too
[silence]
all right [laughter] 
[silence]
right
[silence]
well not that you can see it a little better and it stands out
[silence]
[laughter]
[silence]
oh jeez 
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
rub up against the siding uh
[silence]
um-hum [laughter]
[silence]
right [laughter]
right
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah because_1 it like i- i think i've seen those before but i don't remember what they look like
[silence]
so it'll give you room to get under it sure
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
hm 
[silence]
oh a chainsaw is always something very nice to have
[silence]
[laughter]
then you got to get him to if he's going to do it you've got to twist his arm to get him to go do it
[silence]


[noise]
okay have you ever served as a juror
[silence]
uh-huh
i never have either
[silence]
well i think it's a good idea i think our justice system needs a major overhaul and i'm not sure what needs to be done to fix it but i think they've got a lot of problems
[silence]
true
[silence]
yeah i think that's true
[silence]
[laughter]
yeah do you would you prefer all trials by a judge
[silence]
yeah i would agree with that i think you're right i think they sometimes get carried away by the circumstances and make huge settlements thinking well it's only going to cost the insurance company and
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
if they give them_1 all the information i don't know when it comes to sentencing phase i guess they tell them_1 if a guy if the person has a previous record and stuff
sometimes it seems like during the trial part the jury's not you know misses some of the best evidence because they make them_1 leave and
the judge decides whether or not they should hear it
[silence]
right
[silence]
yeah
do you think the verdict should be completely unanimous by the jury
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
oh
some of them_1 disagree i mean some of them_1 said one way and some the other
[silence]
i think it does have to be unanimous
[silence]
i know they can poll a jury make sure everybody agrees with what they said the verdict was but
i thought that they all had to [laughter-agree] or else they it was a hung jury
and
yeah i thi[nk]- i don't know how i feel about that i think maybe uh
majority might be sufficient
it's hard to say though i
[silence]
oh
yeah i hadn't thought about international trials at all
[silence]
right
[silence]
yeah
yeah
[silence]
yeah i think maybe they'd need to be more knowledgeable though than just your average Joe off the street
for something like that because of the cultural differences
things like that
[silence]
yeah what about uniform sentencing
[silence]
right yeah like if you're convicted of a certain crime you automatically get so many years it's not a discretionary thing
[silence]
[vocalized-noise]
[silence]
yeah
i wish that when they sentence someone if they're going to sentence him to five years then make him serve five years
you know
[silence]
yeah i
[silence]
yeah and sometimes those people are are young enough they can still get out and cause a lot of trouble
[silence]
yeah i don't believe that [laughter-very] [laughter-often] [laughter-happens]
[silence]
i don't think so either In fact i think they end up worse because the conditions are so bad
yeah
[silence]
i think i think maybe they ought to just be punished with some some kind of real punishment like hard labor for a shorter length of time you know actually make them_1 do something that's not pleasant
and do it and get it over with and get back in the you know world and not spend so much time sitting around letting the bad influences of the other ones rub off on them_1 and
yeah
[silence]
yeah something besides license plates and [laughter-tiddlywinks]
yeah
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
well i think that covers it
it was nice talking to you
um bye
you too [noise] bye
[noise]


[silence]
never i've never been served on the jury never been called up in a jury although some of my friends have been jurors
[silence]
you haven't huh if you were uh what do you think about the whole concept of a trial by your peers
[silence]
i think the major thing they need to [noise] correct is how long it takes something to get to jury and to get to trial
and i don't know if that's just a pure volumes number or or what but uh
sometimes i think the jury is ignorant in the facts of law and how things should be determined and they're too easily swayed by their emotion
hence is possible error as you can see in all the ironsides
TV shows
[silence]
no i think there are certain things that uh the jury can determine as far as uh guilty or not guilty but as far as the aff[ixing]- aff[ixing]- affixing of punishment and fines and things of that nature 
[noise] i don't know if that is best left up to the jury to de[cide]- to award you know two point two million dollar kind of settlement versus a judge knowing you know it's true that you know this may be sad and all that thing but uh
the jury i think is best in most cases suited for determination of guilt and innocence but not the award of of penalties and fines and punishment
[silence]
um-hum
that's true but uh i do like the idea of the jury being the the the people who decide in the matter of uh if it's a jail term versus life and death
you know the death penalty and such
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
right
[silence]
yeah uh it it it's kind of difficult and i guess the whole system is set up to rather let uh some guilty people go free than to put an innocent person in in jail
although you still hear about those occasionally
[silence]
um i don't know i you know i heard a very interesting and maybe it's just the TV show or movie i was watching they were going through a trial
and i think it was like on one of the the documentary TV shows where they ask for the the verdict by the jury
and they went by each one saying guilty or innocent guilty or innocent
and they took it more as just like a majority
so i- i
[silence]
exactly but they took you know whatever the majority was so i didn't know if that was just something for drama or that's truly the way it is i always thought it had to be unanimous
[silence]
but uh
rather interesting
[silence]
uh-huh i did i did also
[silence]
[noise]
uh-huh
[silence]
what about in international
trials do you think they should have a jury there i think that would be kind of interesting
[silence]
i guess the the problem with that is there's no true authority in any kind of international verdicts
like you know the old day with the rack we they're going to say okay you're guilty and you have to pay Kuwait four million dollars well whose going to really make them_1
nobody
[silence]
so
but i think it would be kind of interesting to incorporate that concept of you know [vocalized-noise] people from different countries
uh in as international law also
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
right
[silence]
i don't know how what it would take to be come up with a true perfect
system or if one exists but
[silence]
uh is that the crime and it's already [vocalized-noise] false due to some chart and determine the punishment or
[silence]
um-hum [noise] i think there should be a core minimum that they get but uh
i guess there should be some flexibility because_1 every situation may be unique that the judge can either increase that or keep it just at its minimum things of that nature
i
[silence]
yeah that serves a kind of if they're i guess uh if you sentence someone to life life is only forty nine years something like that 
and i guess you're eligible after twenty seven for parole even though you're in for life 
[silence]
yeah although i guess it's you you want them_1 to rehabilitate and become better rather than sitting in there and being a drain all the time
[silence]
no because uh inside the jail there i don't think there's no real rehabilitation it just
[silence]
yes it's another war zone
but
who knows
[silence]
i agree get them_1 out there
[silence]
sure they should have them_1 go out and doing stuff cleaning up or picking up dirt or weeds or who knows what something for the for the state since the state is paying for them_1 they should get some kind of kind of work out of them
[silence]
exactly
trading their lives for cigarettes
those kinds of things
well good
[silence]
i think so
nice talking to you also
have a wonderful Easter
bye
[noise]


[noise]
[silence]
well i guess i'm maybe naive but i never did feel that Russia was a big threat to us i mean obviously there's the the the possibility of or was the possibility of war
uh but i somehow think that war is one of those things that maybe is inevitable but uh
i don't look at it as a threat in the same sense that that i think this question was meant what about you
[silence]
yes
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]

uh-huh uh-huh
[silence]
right
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
but i guess there was concern uh that I[raq]- Iraq would use
you know nonconventional warheads with with the chemical weapons and things but yet it didn't happen i mean why not
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
oh so you think it was fear that kept Iraq from using it but yet the
[silence]
[noise]
[silence]
uh-huh uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
right
[silence]
right i don't think we've done that to Saddam Hussein yet
[laughter] i think that's that's that's not very likely
but yet you know as as the parallel Russia is that Saddam Hussein is using the chemical warfare on his own people and i guess that makes sense what you said that
uh within their own borders they feel freer to do what what they feel necessary
yeah
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
right
[silence]
uh-huh
uh-huh uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
well or that that it resolves anything in the end that that negotiations couldn't resolve
[silence]
uh-huh uh-huh
uh-huh
well it sounds like neither one of us thinks that the Soviet Union is a real threat to the US
[silence]
right
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
right right
[silence]
okay well thanks bye-bye
[noise]


[noise]
all righty so uh do you think Russia's still a threat
[silence]
[noise] there you go
[silence]
well i think h[ave]- have you ever read the book Nineteen Eighty Four 
okay you know like how uh these two there was like three continents that were always fighting with each other
right and you could picture it as being Russia versus the US d[uring]- during the whole time and what they would do is they would get their prisoners and kill them as soon as they got them
because the people there could realize that they were the same as as themselves you know the prisoners of wars were were the same as the people living in that country
and you didn't want that to happen and to me it had always been that way i mean what happens is you have a government right and this government controls everything right
and then you have the people inhabiting the country and these people have nothing to do with the government itself and these people are the same as you are
and what goes on is that every time somebody attacks a country supposedly US or Russia attacks a country it's not going to be within the borders of the US or Russia itself
like i was telling people i'm really mad because the whole thing in the Middle East this was going on in Lith[uania]- in Lithuania
they they were announced to be a separate country
but yet the the government that's in Moscow told its army to go in there and get those people and the US didn't go in there and try to save those people
you know it's like you're not going to go in there and say no listen there's a separate country why because you're going into the border
right once you get into the border then there's a threat but what happens is you don't mess with us we won't mess with you but let's mess with the neutral countries
you know and now it's like you know they're saying other people were were i guess other leaders were still crazier about it you know like other people
you could think that they might use a bomb here and a bomb there
but Russia has never been known for throwing an atomic bomb anywhere
and the US has
you know it's like they it seems like they can their their army or whatever can can go in there quicker than an atomic bomb can and do do the job with uh you know less suffering
you know but i think i think the thing is is that
there the thing like they were saying they go you know like Libya could start a nuclear war because of whoever is behind the button
but not the USSR the USSR wouldn't do it
because they got too much at stake
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
well
my my point of view to that is is that it would have had so much i mean the attack would have been so complete on Iraq if they had i mean the first you can imagine the first uh chemical weapon used
that would have meant a total attack of the Iraq country within you know three hours of when the weapon was shot
[silence]
right and what happens is what happens is suppose they get Saddam Hussein which they eventually will he's got one less thing to go against him
i mean if he were to use that he might as well commit suicide because he's going to be captured and you know
but the US also makes a lot of uh you know treaties with other people like saying okay if you give up then you can come live in our country and we'll take care of you like Marcos right
we'll overthrow you but yet you can still come live here you know
[silence]
uh [laughter] no
no
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
right
[silence]
right
and uh you know there's there's just
you know like people will go like they like the U S goes and goes into Panama and what see i don't believe in war that's my thing i don't believe that anybody should die
you know and so then you know you have because what happens is suppose i'm i go to war and i'm holding a gun and i'm just looking at myself holding a gun and whoever shoots first survives you know
but that same person also has a family and you know his parents are going to cry and you know life ends there and to me that's ridiculous
you know i mean i just don't believe it i think there are other ways to fix it even though sometimes there aren't but
it's pretty hard to think that you know people are just going to shoot each other down and it's legal in a situation like that you know
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah i mean i mean Saddam Hussein lost so much money during the war that it was ridiculous and he all he was trying to do was make money at the beginning so
and keep his power but well
[silence]
no i i don't think so i think uh they're getting they're especially getting their life back together now because a lot of things that you saw on TV a lot of uh inhabitants of Russia
would love to stay in their country just as long as they were able to express what they wanted to a lot of like dancers and stuff like that
they said that they wouldn't leave Russia unless Russia told them that they couldn't travel anymore and compete
so it must be a beautiful country it's just that you know
they won't let you get out and when you want to get out of the country that's what you want to do
so oh well i got to go to class now
nice talking to you bye-bye
[noise]


[silence]
so what do you think about a year or two of public service
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yes yeah
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
you know i- i really agree with you um i uh though i've never done that myself i i'm was a basically an education major when i graduated from college and i accepted a job that at the time was just slightly above the poverty level to teach
to um very rural children in a very low income district and i spent a year teaching there and i think it was probably one of my largest eye opening experiences because i come from nice 
middle class white suburban home and i did it um
for one reason i wanted i was working on a masters degree so i wanted to stay close to where i was working on a masters degree but also because i just thought that it would be interesting to live someplace else so totally different than my own upbringing and i it changed
it probably changed my political views it changed my understanding of the world around me
and i think um in fact if if i had to do it all again i you know i- i after that you know you never think of it because i guess because i paid for all of my college education myself i never thought about
doing that because i had all these college loans i'd started paying back
um becau[se]- so that was that was one reason why i never considered it but now that i'm further along and i'm still paying these college loans 
i- i think realistically you know you can have your college loans delayed now because_1 i had them delayed because i'm back in graduate school at thirty years old
um i had them delayed because i'm back in graduate school and on that form it says if your joining the Peace Corps you can have them delayed
uh and i thought that was you know very interesting and i- i would have thought of that earlier i probably would have done you know just like is that is this is that the Mormon church
that does that um-hum because_1 one of my neighbors uh did that in Pittsburgh from Pittsburgh and i thought you know that really now that i'm thirty years old i think that one or two years out of my life would've probably like you said
to be able to travel someplace else whether it be the United States or outside the country i think would've been a very good um experience for me
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
yes
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
yeah
and i think you know we have such a need now you know i taught you know i- i think i was paid
uh about nine thousand dollars to teach for the year and i worked in a very rural school district and i- i one of the things i taught was a computer class and these kids
um you know every girl i taught except for one was pregnant many of the boys in the room had children and they were they were high school juniors
and i and i just there you know they came from poverty they were going to continue in poverty
and it was it was the school district couldn't hire many people it was very difficult for them to hire and i think you know in the sense that aspect of public service for education in some of the inner cities
for um just social workers in some of the inner cities and some of the rural areas where they just need advice on medical um
things i think it's a really good idea and even if it is overseas see i never i- i tell you sometimes i worry about things overseas because we have such problems right here in our own country
um-hum
yeah
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
right um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
yeah i think it would also help them_1 if they then went on to college i know that my first couple of years of college were um
uh probably too carefree at the beginning and then at the end i had to be too serious [vocalized-noise]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
yeah that's true
[silence]
um-hum that's right
i yeah i think i think this was this was a very interesting topic
uh because it's something that you know we don't talk about in this country probably enough
uh you know
[silence]
um-hum
yep that's true
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
oh i think it is
i really think i think um people you should i you know the kids today i teach i spend a lot of my time teaching college students
and um i find great disgust in them in their in their um [laughter] their self-centeredness
and their inability to understand um multicultural or multiracial situations and i really you know they don't understand uh how other people live um they don't understand
[silence]
um-hum
yep i think that's uh j[ust]- just having a good time 
i uh a friend of mine is a psychologist and he always refers to it as uh short-term pleasure oriented i guess he's a technical aspect he likes to apply to it
you know today's young people are short-term pleasure oriented and everything has to be an immediate reward and it has to be fun
um-hum yeah 
[silence]
well they say i think i um have read recently that uh the Bush Administration has increased the funding for the Peace Corps
uh-huh because i guess because_1 of the changes in Eastern Europe
uh they've increased funding for the Peace Corps some of the i guess it's some of the peace dividend in the sense you known when they're decreasing some of the military spending some of that money has gone into the Peace Corps and some of the other overseas programs uh
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
yes yeah that's true
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
yeah that's very true you know how many is it they say we have so many lawyers in this country and i guess i- i live near Washington being in in Baltimore it's something like one in four people in the Washington
area are lawyers
and and i- i just sort of think that's ridiculous yeah with
you know with the great needs that we need today in science and biology and uh you know the the problems we have with AIDS and cancer and and that how come everybody is a lawyer you know you know
[laughter]
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
right um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
yeah you saw statistics that lawyers and doctors make the most money in the long run yeah that's true
[silence]
that's interesting um-hum
[silence]
okay hey thanks so much for the conversation
well thank you very much bye-bye
[noise]


[silence]
well i know it's hard for young people to think about giving up their years you know free their carefree years but people that i have known that have done that i like from other countries especially Germany and Finland 
they are just they have such a better more mature outlook on life and i think they're better people because of it they're much more responsible i know um
the church that i go to um the young men give two years of their life when they turn nineteen you know they're encouraged to do that missionary work and i be[lieve]- i really believe that the people that do that 
are better people and uh make our society better
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
hm 
[silence]
[laughter]
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
hm 
[silence]
yes yes but if
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
well i think so it puts you out on your own and and in a time after high school um
there's kind of a selfishness i mean teenagers in our country are kind of
kind of a year that parents don't look forward to and and things like that and i think that it would help people to become less self-centered and to be more responsible when you're out on your own trying to um
thinking less of your own needs but of other people
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
oh no
um-hum
right
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
yes
it would really um and i don't [laughter] the people that i've known like from Germany and Finland that have done that are they do military service which you know i don't exactly recommend but still
they have benefited from it and um you know although i wouldn't want
m[ilitary]- mil[itary]- to make people to go off to the military voluntarily but it's it has helped them and they are just a lot more mature than the average student and 
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
well that's right a lot of people they flunk out or they get they just
are so excited to be away from home they just spend all there time partying and they do a lot of things to themselves and that we don't really want our young people to be doing and
[silence]
um
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
um-hum
be[cause]- because we're so 
we love our freedom and our freedom of choice
and um having people but you know our like in our church it it is you're free to do that or not you're encouraged to do it because um you know it it helps you and
of course we think it's helping other people and so
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
and they're preoccupied with drinking
[silence]
uh-huh and
[silence]
[laughter]
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
that's true
[silence]
that's really true
yes well i- i don't know how that would ever happen here but at least um
[silence]
oh really
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
hm 
[silence]
well i have seen a big change i think in high school kids that my relatives and friends that um i know when i was in high school i had an idea of what i really wanted to do with
what my what i was going to study and at least i had some interest in a lot of the youth that i come in contact with are they say oh i want to be a doctor i want to be a lawyer why because they make a lot of money
and they don't have a goal they don't have a goal they don't have an interest in their own field of study they're just looking what's going to pay the biggest cash
[silence]
um-hum
area yes
[silence]
yes there's too many people
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
that's right and not enough people want to do that to for
uh because of a service that they could provide you know if you want to be a lawyer because you know that you can provide a service that people need because you have to have lawyers in this country um but if you're just doing it because_1 you think that's the best way to be rich
[silence]
um-hum
that's kind of sad well anyway well i guess i better go
[silence]
well good luck to you i enjoyed it
thanks bye-bye
[noise]


[noise]
okay [laughter]
[silence]
oh i think i think that the um woman's role has come a long way we've gone more into the business aspect of uh
like i say of i don't know working more and then and we i think we've even gone into more of the labor aspect of it also
uh with the pay and everything you know
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
[laughter-oh] and a lot of times you can't yeah
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
yeah my mom um she's a housewife and well there's twelve kids in my family so my mom never could really work you know because_1 she was kind of pregnant from day one she never really had a chance to work
uh she worked before she got married but um she um she doesn't believe in she's very old fashioned she doesn't believe in the woman working unless she has to
yeah
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah uh-huh
yeah um and also like my mom my mom thinks and i mean she she's kind of right with it when both
um partners of of the marriage work she feels that that's taking more away f[rom]- that's that's increasing more unemployment for people that need to work
you know like for for the men that don't have jobs if you know she feels that if those women weren't out there just because they want to do it she said that you know they could stay at home and wi[th]- yeah
um-hum
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
well w[hat]- what do you think about that do you think that um
wh[at]- d[o]- what do you think about the women that are not having families because they want to continue their business
[silence]
i
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
um-hum
or they won't be as good as they could be
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
[laughter]
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
exactly
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
oh my
[laughter] bless you [laughter]
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
yeah i i agree
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
and they just enjoyed the income the extra
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
exactly
[silence]
oh i [laughter-know]
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
exactly
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
see yeah see now um my parents there's no way they could afford to send twelve kids to college and um
so far there's only two of us that have gone and my older brother has paid his entire way and i'm on my i have six weeks left f[or]- and i'll you know i'll graduate and i paid my entire way and that's the way it'll go down the line and
like w[e]- i don't have a car because i'm paying for college and if i want a car my parents always said if we wanted a car we paid for the car and we paid for our own insurance and and i think that's right because
[silence]
um-hum
yeah
[silence]
um-hum like i've had my you know like um like i know kids up here that have their own cars their money's just given to them_1 like they still get their allowance they're twenty years old and they still get an allowance
well i've held a summer job since i you know i was in the eleventh grade
and i have had to take care of my own money i have my own checking account i pay for my own life insurance and i know a lot of kids that don't even know wh[at]- i mean i tell them i pay for my own life insurance and their mouths just drop to the floor
you know
[laughter] well if they do they don't know of it you know [laughter]
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
oh i know
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
[laughter]
uh-huh
[silence]
um
[silence]
actually i think abortion's going to take a turn where there's not going to be as many
because i think contraceptives are going to be more popular i mean i realize that they are popular now but i think
i i r[eally]- i really think people are going to start using more contraceptives and with the abortion it
i i don't think there's going to be many abortions but i don't know what women will do when they get into politics you know about abortion
i think it'll be freedom of choice
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
exa[ctly]- yeah
um-hum
[silence]
yeah
i think if a woman would get into politics or enough women get into politics i d[efinitely]- i think it'll definitely be freedom of choice
um-hum
i i do i'm Catholic and i we we're not supposed to you know say that that's okay but i really feel that it's freedom of choice
i do
[silence]
um-hum
and and different circumstances call for different things
[noise]


[noise]
[silence]
if you want to go first go ahead
[silence]
yes definitely
[silence]
well i feel that uh i we've missed as far as the top jobs go you know the the higher echelon
because_1 if you look at most corporations there isn't a woman
you know that's on the board of directors or that type of thing they're mostly all men there there may be a few but very incidental [laughter] and uh i i really think that it'll be a long time probably before we see that
in one sense um i['m]- i'm an older person in my fifties so i feel that we've lost some things in the sense that women have to work today
you know that that they're not in the home by choice anymore
i[t's]- most of the ti[me]- you know e[ven]- even if you want to say home you c[an't]- you really can't
i[t's]- i[t's]- i[t's]-
y[ou]- you know it's it's gotten to be a two income family to just survive today between taxes and the cost of living and i don't think raises have kept up with you know a lot of the stuff
uh you know as far as your medical insurance and uh just groceries and gasoline and all this you know
so i think that we we did come a long way in the sense that we ha[ve]- we're allowed to vote in you know like you say we're out in the labor force but i think we've lost something too
[silence]
oh God love her
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
that's what i mean and and you know there's a lot of truth to that if you're not going to have a family then that's fine then y[ou]- you know a career is is a smart choice and i think it's great
but if you you have a family i think you owe the family a responsibility
and to have children and just get a daycare or someone to take care of it and not really have the bonding process that takes place with babies and stuff you know
uh i think that both the mother and the child lose and i think that's why there's so many problems you know with kids today because_1 they don't have the family roots anymore
you know i'm not saying that that it's totally gone but it's nothing like what it used to be
you know in that sense
[silence]
oh definitely
[silence]
that's right
they don't want to take care of the kids and the house and that kind of thing that's very true but then they shouldn't have a family
that's what i'm saying you know i i think it's great that women have a choice today
that there are ways to prevent families you know like those basically there's contraceptives and all kinds of ways to prevent pregnancies there's no need to have children if you don't want them
[silence]
that's fine that that's the freedom of choice and i i agree with that because anyone who has children that doesn't really want them isn't going to be a good parent
uh well i shouldn't say they're not going to be a good parent they won't be a caring parent like they won't have that uh
right tha[t's]- that's what i mean it they'll feel like it's uh a job
i[t's]- it's not like something that they really wanted
like i had three children and i mean i i i wanted every one of them
i'm not sorry i had any of them_1 and i worked third shift for a good part of my life just so i would be home with them
you know i had to work but i tried to make it as painless as possible
in fact at one time i worked as a second shift and uh uh one Saturday morning we were all sitting at the breakfast table and the kids were talking daddy this daddy that daddy this daddy that and i was sitting there it was like i didn't belong anymore
and it was because i had worked for about nine months
and when they were coming home i was going to work
and i wasn't there at supper time or bed time or they couldn't tell me what went on at school because they'd be coming in the door i'd be going out
so we were i i felt i was losing my family
and that's why i said that's it i either have to quit or you know try something else so i went on third shift
and i worked that shift for eleven years
yeah
yeah just so that my kids would would have me at home
you know and i feel that's very important it really is and it's too bad be[cause]- because mothers miss out on so much too so i mean in the sense that we've come a long way yes but we've sacrificed a lot to get there
and uh i really think that if uh like after second World War when women went to work in factories and all that that was like out of necessity because_1 the men weren't here anymore
but then it got to be a point where they got some independence
[silence]
exactly a man can afford the necessities a woman affords the luxuries
and i notice today's uh kids you know like we had apartments before we had homes
and we had to walk before we had a car
and now kids at sixteen years old they have their birthday what what do they get they get a car
and uh it to me it's like we've lost our values in this country
we really have and i i'm not trying to be uh you know a prude or old fashioned or anything but
i i don't think if you unless you earn something and you've worked for it and you have a sense of pride about it because while i did this in uh you know no one gave it to me
you'll take better care of that and you'll prize that possession more than someone handing something to you
and it's just like college too i think that if a kid goes to college and you can help them fine but i don't think you should pay the whole way
[silence]
of course
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
sure
[silence]
but i'll bet your values are a lot higher
you know y[our]- y[our]- and your self esteem and the w[ay]- the way you uh you know think about things is probably a lot more common sense
than these kids that don't have that responsibility
[silence]
you that that [vocalized-noise]
[silence]
sure yeah
[silence]
sure they probably don't even have any
or yeah exactly
and that's what i say y[ou]- you'll b[e]- you'll be so much better off for it as you get older because you know a lot of kids resent things that parents tell them and and stuff but it's because you've been there
and no one can tell anyone anything any[thing]- you know you're going to find out for yourself but i mean i don't think you should just not listen to advice even if you don't take it just listen
you know there's there's no harm in that whereas sometimes you can't even get that from a kid you know
[laughter] just attention you know
but really uh wh[at]- what do you feel the changes in the future like with the abortions and that type of thing
women in politics and
president someday maybe [laughter]
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah yeah
well i i still think people have a choice i you know if you can live with it and it's not you know your conscience is clear
then i mean a[ll]- all of us are going to answer to it one day maybe or maybe not i don't know i mean no one's said for sure you know
but uh
[silence]
yes yes
which i mean i think it should be anyway
[silence]
no
[silence]
yeah because_1 i mean you as an individual what you would do that that to me is your business
and uh
[silence]
exactly exactly that's


[silence]
well i haven't uh you know when the war was on i watched um CNN and um Nightline
pretty regularly and read the paper and all but when uh lately like the last week or two i guess with Easter [laughter] and spring break with the kids i um
i hadn't been thinking much about the Middle East and what's going on over there have you been keeping up
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh
[silence]
hum
[silence]
start it
[silence]
there's no official document signed or anything
well i um when the when the crisis began last August i began to think well i i um couldn't remember things that i had studied in the past in school and all so i got out like my encyclopedias and
tried to read about the history and it was really what i felt was kind of cynical because it there just hasn't been any peace over there
ever in thousands of years of history
[silence]
yeah
that's right and it just it's just not people they
and it's not uh you know there isn't any real Arab coalition because they do fight among themselves
and they fight with each other and they have such hatred for
Israel and
[silence]
oh yes
[silence]
hum
[silence]
oh no
he
[silence]
and got it over with [noise] well i just [noise] there's just no way for us to be involved over there and hope that there will be much peace
and um with and that i'm afraid that we would have to stay
[silence]
um-hum 
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
right
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yes
[silence]
yes
[silence]
right
[silence]
right right
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
right
[silence]
right
[noise] well i just uh i'm not interested in keeping big military over there and having to go in and call the shots like you say an[d]- and i just would prefer that i mean sometimes we've said let's keep we
we're not interested in what other countries do and then other times we jump in and do things and while i'm really glad that they
uh i it was important de[militarize]- demilitarize that area because of all the build up armaments
i don't ho[pe]- [laughter-i'd] i hope we don't try to keep uh
in there and try to
keep our fingers in the pot and try to
stay over there because we just don't want to send our people there and make them stay
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah and
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
uh-huh i noticed that
well i don't think there's much hope for a lasting peace over there like they
[laughter]
yeah
history
[silence]
um-hum 
no
[silence]
no
well i guess i better go i have a repairman just came for my refrigerator
but yes well i enjoyed the topic i hope you ha[ve]- have a good day okay bye-bye
[noise]


[silence]
okay
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh well [noise] uh just really the last couple of days since this uh the UN
debate or whatever you want to call it that uh
voted on whether there was going to be a cease fire i guess
you know the thing really isn't over they uh
they had uh kind of uh i don't know if you call it standout or whatever but anyway they stopped
and wait to see if Iraq would accept a permanent cease fire situation though
as i understand it from the Iraqi point of view this current cease fire thing that the UN uh
had set up you know the Iraqis are probably not going to go for at all unless they're just absolutely forced to
so i guess from what i understand the thing could just
they could take off at any moment without uh
you know any
uh-huh you know any local um
you know congressional effort or anything else because you know it's not really settled yet
[silence]
not yet not yet at all
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
no
yeah i don't know why they expect it's going to start this week you know
[laughter]
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah the uh the thing that's kind of interesting uh about this my sons in the Air Force
and uh he came within about a quarter of an inch of going uh to Saudi he ended up in Korea instead and because of the way they split a transportation group out in Lubbock
so he ended up going to Korea but his buddies ended up going to Saudi
well he's still in Korea and his buddies home now [laughter] he he almost wishes that that he could have gone home
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah
the thing uh the other thing too when this all started if you you know if you did much reading on the thing you know Kuwait
the country of Kuwait was just you know somebody's
uh you go back to World War i when the uh Ottoman empire broke up
and the British and the French and the Eng[lish]- yeah the British and the French mostly 
decided to carve up that part of the world and call part of it Persia and part of it uh Iraq and part of it something else you know and they they split things along um
geographical lines but they didn't take any kind of consideration into uh
social or cultural
things at all so the country of Kuwait really doesn't make just a whole lot of sense
except that it is an accepted
place you know it's like any other country you know for whatever reason it's
it's actually there well Iraq has had uh designs on that place since nineteen twenty two 
so you know it wasn't like something that just suddenly popped up
and it's just that this was an excuse
you know to make some noise now something that i read in the paper the other day that i thought was kind of interesting was that the Arab
uh
uh their version or vision or whatever the United States now is somewhat changed in that we won you know now now we are a uh a legitimate player in the game over there you know the
we i don't think we can really understand their attitude because their culture's just so much different
uh we are now a legitimate player in the
in the in the game because we came in with a certain amount of force and we
you know we defeated
you know Iran couldn't do it in seven years and we went in and did in seven days what Iran couldn't do in seven years you know so
that kind of ups our stock in there just a little bit it makes us more legitimate
so now what they're saying is that well since we won whatever we say goes because it's a kind of a might makes right attitude about it and you know we've got the power
yeah
which is why for centuries you know hundreds of years the British and the French had so much influence in there because they'd go in and they'd win something
and then and then they could call the shots for the next
you know period of time until the next strong man came up and you know and
and caused problems so
[silence]
yeah yeah
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah that's that's the uh
that's that's the big thing you know we still got a little bit of the old
you know Vietnam um
problem in you know in the back of our minds we we got this we're we're used to wars where you can get in do the job and get out
Vietnam we never did get out you know never did get the job done because they were too ham strung
uh this thing they they gave the guys uh the power and the material and the
told them to go do it and they did it you know got in and got out i'm not sure the the big fuss that we're going to see now for the next few weeks i would think
is uh you know the uh the business with the uh the Shiites of all people you know in the southern part of the country and also the Kurds because these people evidently are you know being killed off by the thousands
and whether the the United Nations i don't think the US will do it on their own but whether the United Nations comes around and says hey wait a minute we know this thing isn't
uh all that much over we've got to go back in there and and be sure that this large population isn't just wiped out
which is seems to be exactly what's happening right at the moment
but uh you know
[silence]
oh well no no there there never will be i mean uh uh the only way that you're going to have peace over there if if we determine that we want to go in and wipe out every last one of them
you know until we make a decision to do that there won't be peace but i don't think we want to make that decision either
so that's that's a little rough you know we're not we're not quite up to that sort of thing
so
[silence]
oh
[laughter]
oh well that's fun
[silence]
you too bye bye
[noise]


[noise]
[silence]
good morning
[silence]
[vocalized-noise]
no no go ahead [laughter]
[silence]
oh very good because actually um when i was in college i visited Mexico several times i was in the Peace Corps and um Peru but but recently i have been following the Middle East rather than 
[silence]
Central America
[silence]
right
[silence]
right
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
did that have
[silence]
um so you don't you don't feel that that we were um
exploiting in the sense of we were benefiting and they weren't
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh di[d]- did we tend to um change their attitu[des]- attitudes like
some times when Americans go into foreign countries they tend to flaunt American things Americanism um consumer products TV the whole works
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
right
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah i was in Peru
Peru but um
i there weren't as i recall or at least i wasn't aware of that many Americans there except for a very heavy concentration of Peace Corps volunteers this was when the Peace Corps first are started and it was one of the big targets
and um i don't i don't think at that time at least Peace Corps was
uh
an obnoxious group in the sense that that we were very controlled regarding number of days off and and you couldn't just take up take off and leave your group and go explore and and things like that
but and i was working actually in the savings and loan program so that was quite specialized although i was living in the slums i was really working with the middle class
[silence]
i was up in Arequipa
[silence]
and um
uh-huh
so
[silence]
i don't have any idea um probably not i mean there were thir[teen]- i was uh Per[u]- Peru thirteen which meant there were twelve groups before mine
that had gone in and and some of them were quite big in the sense they were community development and they were building schools and doing coops and things like that health um inoculation and and things 
[silence]
no no i believe they did because um some of some of the the Peace Corps uh that i knew of did marry Peruvians
and have been back and every now and then some news filters in that they went to see some of the old things and of course the savings and loan program um
that was that you know that that just continued to grow in fact after my group i mean we were just a very small specialized group too to get that going and spread and then of course Peace Corps bowed out of that because that's uh uh
something that nationalized very quickly and the same with the coops 
[silence]
right
[silence]
uh-huh
yeah i've you know some of the programs i would have concern about like um the language teaching you know i mean
why should we push English and a lot of people were down there teaching English and when they talked about Hungary or someplace one of the eastern law countries requesting Peace Corps to teach 
language you know to me that's a little bit marginal i did teach economics at the university one night a week and the textbook was in English but basically i taught it in Spanish because i mean
i really didn't see the point in their knowing stuff rotely and writing it on a test 
[silence]


[noise]
good morning
uh okay go ahead yeah i understand the topic this morning is uh our policy in Latin America and you know what we've been doing down there so i don't know
as you indicated you don't have too much input into the area it it just so happens that uh our daughter-in-law is Panamanian
and uh we have been in Panama and i have worked in El Salvador and
we visit Mexico occasionally so [laughter] yeah we we do have a little information on it here but uh
[silence]
oh uh-huh
[silence]
yeah
it does seem to have quieted down there just a little bit that's that's for sure
no i the US policy uh towards Central America as far as uh well i kind of go back to to the El Salvador thing because Texas Instruments had a
a plant down there for a while and i worked in there for a little while and at that particular time let's let's see that was seventy three seventy four kind of before the the uh the
the uh Civil War really picked up down there and US policy at that particular time there was of course military assistance to uh to the government itself you know anything that's
that's {anticommunist} you know we kind of had a tendency to be pro [laughter] it don't matter what their excesses were and i believe at the time that i was down there 
that uh the government uh the Salvadorian government you know really gotten out of hand yet the uh right wing death squad type situation i believe that that was beginning to form but i don't
i i wasn't really aware of it's being you know terribly uh you know rapid at the time that that i was down there i think that really kind of developed a little bit later on 
but uh our policies seem to be pretty much one of uh you know trying to setup businesses
down there and use the one resource anyway that Salvador had [noise] plenty of and that was people we didn't seem to be going in and taking anything out of the country other than just it's it's labor
because everything that TI did anyway we we shipped in and it was worked on down there assembled and then sent back here so i didn't feel that we really ex[ploiting]- exploiting them any
[silence]
no uh in the particular incidence that i was aware of now TI wasn't the only ones in there Playtex was in there was uh several other companies and uh
of course we kind of concentrate on there wasn't much to take out of the country i felt like we're going in and taken all their um their gold or oil or bananas or coffee or anything like that because uh it just
the only thing that they had a great abundance of was uh you know human beings [laughter]
[silence]
[vocalized-noise]
yeah i understand what you say there was a uh [noise]
the time that i was down there i stayed quite a a bit at the uh uh one of the big hotels San Salvador and at the time i thought there ought to be a law against American tourists
because they for the most part tend to be the most obnoxious
as a as a group and i saw this in Panama so uh oh you know it's it's the uh the almost stereotype
you know flowery shirt shorts camera hanging around their neck you know demanding this that and the other thing you know we're we're here and we want this and we want that and that sort of thing that's
that's the stereotype that's very strong down there you know that uh
the you know that sort of thing
i i i believe those of us who were working down there got a little bit more appreciation for
you know the local
uh culture i really don't believe that we were
quite that bad but yet they were having to deal directly with uh you know with the uh the local people
and uh
but boy there is a there is a bad uh uh you know the old brash or ugly American type 
situation and i saw incidences in the hotel where i just wanted to go over and crawl in the corner and say oh my God those are those are not Americans [laughter] they can't be but they are
and uh of course now i i do have to i remember one case where we had some Canadians in there who were every bit as bad but i mean it i think it's just kind of the North American
situation uh in Panama they've been used to Americans down there for so darn long
but i didn't see quite as much of that sort of thing as Panamanians are just about as [laughter] as uh as as Americans as far as uh creature comforts you know they're uh they're they're every bit uh
i i know when my my son was in the Air Force and he was stationed in Panama and he married a Panamanian girl and when she came up here uh you know she's
y[ou]- kn[ow]- except for the language situation some of the cultures she's just about an American you know is as far as TV and
and you know the the moneymaking part of it and all that matter of fact if anything she's worse [laughter] but uh uh it it just there's little enclaves down there where you know Americans have a lot of influence
and the local population kind of
[silence]
um you know sort of accepts that but i've also seen the other side of it too
[silence]
well you were in Peru
[silence]
uh-huh
uh-huh
[silence]
oh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh What uh what area did you live in
[silence]
oh okay yeah
i've heard of it
[silence]
well
well is are they is Peace Corps still active down in there
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
oh has those influences lasted do you know whether the the things that that you and your groups before you
did did those
did those live on or were they reabsorbed or how
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
well that's that was kind of the the aim wasn't it to get it started and then have it
taken up by the oh okay oh so you know well that's
i had wondered sometimes i knew that there was a lot of a lot of effort and a lot of work went into a lot of that and i just wondered if if it lasted and if it took you know like
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
oh
[silence]
yeah
yeah my brother-in-law teaches at uh Northern Illinois University and they were in China here a couple of years ago and he was over there
at uh the University of Shah and and teaching


[silence]
so uh describe your family budget
[silence]
well yeah and to some extent uh utilities i imagine
[silence]
uh they have that to some extent here but it's not quite as good
[silence]
and
uh transportation expenses i guess you own a car
[silence]
and you know how much you're going to drive every week
[silence]
huh
[silence]
uh
[silence]
yeah i understand that we we have a real similar situation ours uh
quintupled at least uh
so there is a real family budget
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
if you're lucky
[silence]
exempt or nonexempt
[silence]
wow must be nice
[silence]
part of the high price spread uh
no uh
[silence]
well we don't
we do but we don't have a family budget
we have the fixed things that we have to pay
[silence]
and
we have the things that are extras but it seems that by and large the extras just don't exist
[silence]
and
well you know the auto budget
[silence]
car payment sucks a hell of a lot of it dry
[silence]
and insurance is insurance bad there
[silence]
well we've got one eighty nine 
[silence]
wow that's that's not bad four hundred and something a year that's that's
[silence]
that's cheaper than we pay
[silence]
well here in Colorado it's even worse because_1 we have uh no fault
[silence]
do you have that there
[silence]
well no fault's rather funny in Colorado because uh it seems that 
[silence]
everyone pays all the time
instead of just the guilty party pays
[silence]
you're kidding
[silence]
God
[silence]
not at all
[silence]
they don't even try to keep up with it
God
so you lived in Texas for a while
huh
[silence]
are where you from originally
[silence]
huh so you just basically went home when you had a chance
[silence]
uh that's nice
[silence]
God that's great uh no i'm a native Texan
[silence]
west Texan
there is a difference
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
well i'm i'm a west Texan Lubbock Midland Odessa
[silence]
Amarillo Dumas Panhandle 
a different world from down there
[silence]
so uh
Colorado's been fun
but they have a real problem
[silence]
next to every window the state
seems to have put up a turnstile
and every time you
look at a look at the mountains
[silence]
or think about looking at the mountains
you got to throw in a dollar
[silence]
or or so it seems i- i may just be paranoid but that state income tax is just eating me alive
[silence]
yeah yeah property taxes and
yeah well Colorado
[silence]
insp[ection]-
you know they have the state income tax
but then they also have property taxes
and they also have sales taxes and they just
[silence]
and they just get you every direction they can
[silence]
and i just don't know sir but they it seems like they trying to get you every which way
[silence]
oh yeah
[silence]
i've heard of the book
[silence]
legally
[silence]
legally cut money on your taxes huh
[silence]
and that includes everyone at TI
[silence]
well even the you know the non exempts 
technically yet we haven't had our salary frozen
yet
[silence]
but when you're only at living wage it doesn't matter
[silence]
you know survival is a funny state
[silence]
yes
[silence]
did
well i've been with the company sixteen years now i was a WF for several years 
[silence]
it just n[ever]- never seems to improve
[silence]
it
it and it doesn't seem to get much better for the exempts either unless you're twenty eight or above 
[silence]
it's really a shame
[silence]
oh
[silence]


[silence]
well i've uh
for a lot of years i i've pretty much flied without one and uh just recently uh we we set up a budget and and we're trying to stick to it we just bought a new house so we've got everything you know pretty much we know what our uh
our fixed expenses are per month and then we've got some ones that are variable that that pretty much stay within a certain range and then uh then there's the ones that you never know anything about and that's the the food budget
but that
[silence]
yeah well the utilities they're pretty much uh
uh you can pretty much uh figure what they're going to be and one of the nice things here is the electric company has a plan where they'll average them out for you
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
yes sir
[silence]
well i used to um i used to know uh fairly close to exactly how many miles i drove because i- i was very convenient i lived uh
uh nine tenths of a mile from work
so so it was you know two miles a day [laughter] to and from work [laughter] so it kind of cut my transportation costs a lot but now i've just bought a new house and i'm a half hour
and so my uh transportation costs have gone up by uh five times [laughter]
[silence]
yeah pretty much um the problem is there never seems to be enough money
uh i have three children and it seems like the more money you make the more money you have the more things that they seem to need
and uh of course nothing ever goes down i mean uh i remember you know i have five children total i have three left in the house
and i can remember years ago when uh school would start and i'd go buy all five kids you know shoes and i could get out of the out of the uh shoe store without spending more than thirty five dollars nowadays thirty five dollars buys about one pair of shoes 
[laughter-yeah] so i mean things have just really gone out of sight in the last uh i guess about the last ten years
i'm exempt
[silence]
[laughter]
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um
i've got uh two older cars there both one's a seventy seven and one's a seventy eight 
and uh my insurance is about uh
it was running about four hundred dollars a year but when i moved to the new town i live in because it's a different county
which has less crime and uh less you know less highways and so it's a cheaper place to live as far as the insurance company's concerned so my my
i think my insurance dropped about uh sixty dollars a year
[silence]
well it's actually three hundred and forty for each one of the cars so [noise]
[silence]
yeah yeah i was down in Texas for two years and i was paying unbelievable rates for both car insurance and for home insurance um they
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
uh in Maryland they uh they have no fault in Maryland also
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
um-hum
yeah
it's kind of it's kind of strange here the way things go uh here if you have an accident and no one's injured the police won't even show up
nope
they tell you if nobody's injured you all exchange names and take it up with your insurance company
[silence]
[vocalized-noise] well if you i don't know how familiar you are with Maryland but uh especially the the center part of Maryland where i ninety five runs through it is really heavily populated 
[silence]
and there's just so many people and so many accidents every single day
[silence]
that it take another police force just to answer the traffic
[silence]
no
[silence]
not a bit
[silence]
yes sir
i spent uh
couple of years down there moved down there in eighty seven and moved out in eighty nine 
[silence]
uh right here in Maryland
and my family
[silence]
yeah my family uh didn't like Texas and i had a chance to uh transfer up TI bought a company about seven months after i moved to Texas right here in Hunt Valley
so i got an opportunity to transfer back and i took it
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
um-hum
yeah
[laughter-yeah] believe me i know there is i lived in Plano and i don't know if you're familiar with Plano but Plano maybe five percent of the Plano actually were from Texas
everybody else was an import
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
yes
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
um
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
[laughter]
[silence]
yeah
yeah they have a state income tax in Maryland but i noticed when i was in the in the
in Texas they didn't have a state income tax but they sure nailed you on those darn county taxes and school taxes and property tax[es]-
oh my God ate you alive
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah it sure does um there's uh some good books that i've read um that you might be interested in
um Charles D Gibbons is the guy who runs some ads on light night TV and he's got seminars you can go to and they try to hook you into his organization which costs about four hundred bucks
but he's got a couple of books out one of them_1 is called um [noise] Wealth Without Risk
[silence]
yes it's a very good book it's tells you how to cut money on your taxes and on your insurance and then and what to do
what to do with the money that you save
[silence]
yes [noise] yes sir
legally legally cut money on your taxes and on your uh insurance and then he tells you how to invest that money in order to uh uh
[noise] you know be wealthier uh he also has a new book out that i purchased right before i moved and haven't had a chance to uh crack it open yet um
[noise] Financial Self Defense i believe is the name of it uh the man uh has a lot of good ideas some of them i already knew about some of them i had already practiced but i suggest it to anyone who wants to be better off financially to read it because uh 
[silence]
[laughter-yes] yes i'm one of the ones that had my salary frozen for ninety one yes 
[silence]
yet
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah i know what you mean i uh when i was in Dallas i was supervisor and i had uh four non exempts
[silence]
um under me
and uh i- i was appalled at what the hell they were paying them i just couldn't believe it
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
well i i've
this company that they bought they ended up buying a very high payroll
and uh the you know uh i thought i was making a good wage you know high wage till i ca[me]-


[noise]
uh so you have children i take it
[silence]
you don't
[silence]
so it's not a very valid topic
[silence]
uh yes
one
stepdaughter
ten
[silence]
and uh
[silence]
you know how they are at that age i guess
you having been ten once
yourself
[silence]
oh we have one
[silence]
uh Keeshonden
[silence]
yeah fuzzy little thing
[silence]
a fuzzy little dog
rather
rather odd personality he he he's fun
anyway uh
[silence]
time we spend with our children
[silence]
it seems almost as though children hate it
[laughter] yes
[silence]
time spent with mom and dad is uh 
[silence]
next is that's probably one of the worst punishments on earth to them
an[d]-
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
i
[silence]
they
you know
parents are a curse that they just have to live with
[silence]
so it it's interesting
we do spend time driving in the mountains
[silence]
no
[silence]
do you work for TI
[silence]
you're working then
[silence]
with every passing day we wonder if we will be
[silence]
it's
[silence]
it's better to [vocalized-noise] to be employed
especially these days where there is not a job right around the corner
[silence]
and that creates family tensions
[silence]
yes
[silence]
no no i don't have any an[y]- children
[silence]
uh
well it varies what it is of course
but usually mom and dad are a curse 
you know they 
they'd much rather be with friends friends are cool parents aren't
[silence]
but i remember
[laughter]
well i'm sure part of it is a male female thing you know i- i remember whenever i was growing up
[silence]
often times spent with my Dad was oh just wonderful you know go
[silence]
go hunting or
go to the races or
[silence]
or oh any number of things
[silence]
and
we'd have
um great times
[silence]
and it seems that well now the bank's not available
[silence]
and entirely too much time is spent my wife and i were wondering what if
[silence]
and and what if's always rough
[silence]
but you know we do have our trips and we do have our fun and
[silence]
i don't know little girls aren't interested in lot of the same things little boys are or were
[silence]
hunting and and
looking for arrowheads and
[silence]
uh but they don't like it
[silence]
there there there is a difference there
[silence]
and th[e]- and
[silence]
[noise]
[silence]
well
[silence]
girls at that age
[silence]
video games boys and malls
[silence]
not necessarily in that order
and friends of course
and
[silence]
that's a little tough for fathers
[silence]
fathers don't even like malls
they despise shopping
[silence]
so is that quality time
[silence]
yeah if
but there is camping and we both enjoy that
[silence]
somewhat yeah yeah
getting up in the mountains an[d]-
and getting away from it all and
[silence]
that's somewhat fun
[silence]
it's
so what do you think about
child rearing is
how how would you spend time with kids
[silence]
oh yeah
[silence]
yeah but
[silence]
well yeah and
amazingly a lot of times it's
real easy
you know
a lot of times whenever we head out of town on a trip or something
it's real easy to swing in there for breakfast
breakfast and run and
[silence]
breakfast is a kind of a funny meal anyway
and uh
[silence]
kids eat funny
[silence]
and little girls are worse about it than little boys
they
[silence]
or or something yeah go on a diet or they
they have a
[silence]
well
to some extent the public schools or the schools in general
influence them
the eating meat kick
[silence]
you know it like it's really morally wrong to eat meat or something i- i'm not sure
[silence]
of course that's not the way i was raised being raised in West Texas
[silence]
oh yeah
born in Denton raised in Lubbock
[silence]
so i understand about bass
[silence]
but it
but it is interesting
i- i will tell you yeah
[silence]
every person out there should have kids at least once or or have some
that they can borrow for a time
[silence]
because everyone needs some torture in their lives
[silence]
uh but Jenny is a sweet kid
[silence]
and yeah we do do things and
it it's funny it's almost like a lot of things that were available to us
as children
to go do
[silence]
the money's not available
[silence]
you know
we were talking about how much it cost to go to Disney Land
golly a couple three hundred dollars
you know for just for just a day not in[cluding]- you know a day or two not including
lodging and food and all that
[silence]
it's i don't see how anyone can afford it
[silence]
and
i understand Six Flags is real expensive now
[silence]
oh yeah
[silence]
twenty bucks a whack now
[silence]
but at least once you pay your way in there at Six Flags
[silence]
yeah yeah food and
[silence]
junk to carry out
[silence]
so that's that's not as bad
[silence]
but golly
you know Disney World or Disney Land
well our problem is that you know a trip to Six Flags or Disney World or uh Disney Land or God forbid Disney World would take forever
[silence]
or you'd have to pay air fare and
oh for a fam[ily]- you know for a family it gets pretty expensive pretty quick and rent a car when you get there and all that yeah
[silence]


[noise]

[silence]
[laughter] 
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
[laughter] really 
uh-huh
[silence]
oh yeah
[silence]
that's why i lucked out my dad worked for Braniff when i was a kid so we got you know our air fare free and we got d[iscounts]- 


[silence]
so what kind of neat hobbies do you have
[silence]
i like gardening i wish i had a green thumb though
i've got a brown thumb that's what everything turns
[silence]
i keep trying uh you know you just can't can't give up on it uh i uh i bought some uh plants from Michigan Bulb Company [laughter] they send them to you all ready alive
[silence]
oh really
i guess i guess these are going to croak too since i've got cats i decided to get some catnip
lots and lots of catnip so it's it's still green and it's been two days so i'm encouraged [laughter]
[laughter]
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah there's a uh i don't know do you have Lowe's up there
its uh building uh contra[ctor]- or building supplies place
um they they also have a garden shop and they they offer just as good a guarantee if you buy it from them
yeah
[silence]
um
[silence]
hum
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah yeah
yeah something like that uh i got a whole bunch of bulbs along with this stuff so i'm going to wait on those
[silence]
uh probably Spring but uh i don't much care about things like that i'll i'll make a little sort of greenhouse a miniature greenhouse to put all this stuff in
something something to keep me occupied you see
i'll uh buy some plastic and make a little house and
yeah and watch the cats tear it up
[silence]
they they just like to get in and dig
[silence]
oh they love to dig i had i had some uh i don't know what kind they are i've already forgotten just regular old flower seeds
and i planted them and i was so i was so thrilled because they came up i mean nice green shoots coming up all over the place and then my cats got into it and started digging and that took care of that
so i have to hang these things high so they can't get to them especially the catnip
[silence]
three
[silence]
[laughter]
[silence]
um yeah yeah because they they like to get in and fertilize things too but uh why would it be illegal
[silence]
oh
[silence]
uh yeah right
[silence]
well if nobody yeah if nobody complains you're all right
[silence]
um
[silence]
um
yeah an and if somebody raises a stink about it you can always go before the association and argue your case anyway
you know you don't have to put up with all these wild critters coming into your property
[silence]
yeah right here Bambi [laughter]
uh gosh
well let's see other than gardening which i fiddle at i'm not very good at what else do i mostly just computer stuff
i just like playing with my computer and doing stuff on that uh cooking that's not really a hobby it's a necessity but but i enjoy it i like to think that i'm a very good cook
[silence]
hobbies that's about it i don't have much time for hobbies so uh
between being a student and trying to run a business on the side you don't have a lot of time
yeah and raising cats
[silence]
well it's it started out as a hobby actually uh it just it developed into sort of a business uh you know we breed them and all that
but we didn't you know we didn't really start it for the money it was just they were fun to have around and we figured if we're going to have them we might as well have some purebreds and
[silence]
and now it developed in to going to cat shows and finding studs for them and you know all this kind of stuff
uh i've got a uh a Bombay a Turkish Van and a Himalayan Persian
yeah the {himmy} is probably the sweetest one she's she's just a little sweetheart 
we uh the the Bombay had a litter uh last October and i just got her back from the vet this morning getting her spayed only going to breed them once
and uh she's not she's not feeling too great today
[silence]
no uh m[ost]- most breeders are in it for the money so they'll bree[d]- they'll breed them twice a year
and i i just think that it's kind of i don't know it's kind of cruel you know they just they just breed these they breed them before they're ready uh and
you're never you're never real and and they they do a lot of inbreeding too and so you end up with you know kind of strange kittens
and i just don't like that
[silence]
we're we sold all that litter
um
we there's not that much call to for Bombay's 
um
they're they're registered but they're not they're not uh they're not show cats
uh so all you can do is sell them as pet quality
uh so what you've got is a registered pet and not too many people want Bombay's they want things like {himmy} Persians and Turkish Vans 
Turkish Vans if you've never seen one i mean you wouldn't know that it was a pure bred it's just uh medium size short hair cat it's got he's mostly white with uh brown and black patches 
but they have nice personalities and they're very inquisitive
um now the {himmy} we'll probably breed her a couple of times and we'll we'll end up keeping one out of each litter and then breeding those 
it's just the stud fees are so much though it'll cost about three hundred dollars for a stud for her we we want to breed her with a champion so
[silence]
yeah the Persian is
and the other two are short hairs
[silence]
yeah she's uh she's sweet going to have some nice kittens i hope 
she's uh she's if you if you know what a Himalayan is generally they look something like uh well they come in a lot of different colors people don't realize it but they're sort of like uh Siamese in a way they have the uh they have the uh 
they have the gloves on the paws and they're they're usually two colored uh but this one is uh
is she's pre[dominantly]- predominantly uh black but she has chocolate uh paws chocolate stomach and silver on her hindquarters
and yeah she's she's quite attractive looking
hope hope the stud will find her attractive
and and that she has a whole bunch of kittens but we have to be careful uh you know we have to get a particular color point uh stud you can't just breed them with anything we have to get a uh we have to get a silver point {himmy} 
so that the silver will be predominate in the kittens
that's it that's the fun part trying to figure out what you've got to breed them with can't just go out there and say okay you guys breed you know [laughter]
that's right
[silence]
well actually i mean it it is a business in a way but it it's a lot of fun as a hobby especially when you go to shows and get to see all the different cats we're we're about to get another breed we're go[ing]- we're going to buy a Devon Rex
and i didn't i don't like Devon Rexes at first it's a well actually it's a mutant it it comes from England and uh fr[om]- in the county of Devon
and it's a mutant cat and they're they're pretty expensive we're going to we're going to shell out probably about a thousand bucks for one um they're
very thin they're they're they're long and lanky and skinny and they have real short hair it's curly as a matter of fact
um yeah it it it's a strange looking cat uh i didn't like them at first they've got great big ears


[silence]
well i like gardening a lot i like to be outside um
[laughter]
uh oh [laughter] is but do you tr[y]- keep trying anyway
[silence]
no no i've never had any luck with their's
right
[silence]
oh
[silence]
[laughter]
no i i haven't had had good luck with that company uh i think some of it depends how long things stay in the mail probably
but i've had to to get my money back from them and had better luck with with some of the the more expensive companies
because_1 they
[silence]
uh well
[silence]
no
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
oh that's great now our local stores don't don't offer any guarantee
but some of the the mail order ones that i've dealt with for roses and that they offer through through the first Summer
which at least if they if they take off the first year they're probably going to come up unless there's uh a terrible freeze or something
[silence]
oh they're bulbs for Spring or Fall
[silence]
[laughter]
[silence]
uh-huh uh-huh
[silence]
[laughter]
cute
[silence]
right i don't know that do cats bother bulbs i think more the mice or other rodents
[silence]
oh i see so if you have fresh dirt they'll
[laughter]
[silence]
uh gee
[silence]
how many cats do you have oh okay
actually i just put a uh little fence around my yard uh um
which is i suppose technically illegal but i had so many groundhogs last year that i think they'll let me get by with it and it it's got this one inch mesh and what i've noticed it's kept the cats out and i love it [laughter]
[silence]
well because we have these tow[n]- uh i live in a townhouse and anyway all of our areas have associations that you have to get permission
and you know they want uh privacy fences
[silence]
right right well they do walking tours too so
but at least because i back up to um a hillside where the uh wild animals are i think i can probably justify it
[silence]
right right i mean
[laughter]
right the first year the deer ate my garden and i was just astounded i'm going deer right here in the city [laughter]
[laughter]
exactly
and so
[silence]
oh
[silence]
[laughter]
[silence]
oh great
[silence]
right that keeps you busy
[silence]
[laughter] i mean that could become a hobby
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
um
[silence]
uh-huh
uh-huh what kind of cats are they
[silence]
wow [laughter]
[silence]
[laughter]
[silence]
oh okay
[silence]
um is that typical to only breed them once
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
right
[silence]
uh-huh uh-huh
so will you uh breed one of the litter then next year
[silence]
oh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
oh i see
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
oh
[silence]
right
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
right now these are long haired
uh-huh uh-huh
right
oh that's nice
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
[laughter]
[silence]
gee
[silence]
uh-huh uh-huh
[silence]
[laughter] and that she has kittens that look like her
[silence]
i see
[silence]
[laughter] you can't just tell them that anyway but [laughter] oh dear well it really sounds like uh uh a business more than a hobby
[silence]
what is it
[silence]
oh
[silence]
um
[silence]
huh interesting
[silence]


[silence]
okay well uh how do you feel about uh drug testing
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah i am too a little bit i mean i- i don't
want to be around people who are really on drugs and that sort of thing and and you know obviously they're probably not going to be doing a good job and so forth but i don't really like having to do it
it and i don't like the idea of it it's it's makes too much of a big brother type of thing
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
hum-um
[silence]
yeah yeah i think so too but you know it's one of those things
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
plus i guess if they are in trouble enough to be jailed or something of that nature for any length of time then the company has lost what they've put into that employee and their expertise or whatever
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
well do you think that um it should be like we have this sort of random spot testing type of thing or
do you think it would be more palatable if we had some sort of regular schedule or would that just allow everybody a chance to get out of it
[silence]
well you know if if they have time enough they can
stay off of it
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
i think so too uh i know the the group i was in at the time this all came up they uh were quite vocal about it uh through electronic mail boy they just really
you know [laughter] let them_1 have it from one end to the other vehemently but uh it has quieted down but i don't think they probably feel any differently and some some of them_1 did quit the company
[silence]
true
[silence]
um-hum
yeah i wouldn't like anything of that [laughter-nature] you know don't tell me what to do [laughter-you] [laughter-know] 
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah well i guess too if i thought that this would help really and truly do away with the drug problem
then that would be one thing but i think it's too minor and too
you know in in the whole scope of things this isn't going to to have any real affect on what's going on on the street
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
well yes that yes i- i think that could be a big problem you know i would just be irate if they said it was [laughter-positive] [laughter-and] i knew it wasn't you know that just really rub me the wrong way 
[silence]
yeah
yeah
[silence]
right
[silence]
no
[silence]
i guess the one that really got me too was that uh let's say your spouse is on a particular drug and you know what that is and then you end up with the same problem and you take their leftover medicine that's not allowed
[laughter-you] know that's that's totally [laughter-out] 
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
oh that's interesting
well
well i guess we've exhausted that one [laughter]
enjoyed talking to you good-bye 
[noise]


[silence]
um personally i don't have a problem with it uh i think uh
as far as uh protecting fellow employees protecting their reputation of the company
and the quality of work that the people do um it's justified on the other hand um i do agree that it's it's a it's an invasion of privacy as far as a person's
involvement outside of work um i would never i would never have a problem with anyone testing me but i can understand why people would object so i guess uh i guess uh i'm kind of mixed on it still at this point
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
that's right
[silence]
that's absolutely right it it uh i guess it all comes down to uh you know a a definition of uh how much out outside activities affect your work and uh
uh granted you know any any kind of drug use on on company property and whatnot is is definitely not acceptable uh uh i don't think anybody would ever argue that or uh
any any after affects carrying over into the workday but um
you know i- i don't i'm not particularly concerned with what people do um after they leave for the day especially if i don't if i don't uh see any results of it the next day
[silence]
well it it is it you know on the other hand you you've got uh you've got the uh the possibility of people
oh you've got some people could be arrested for uh drug use drug dealings and things like that and uh if their if their employers
name hits the papers and that it's it's it's a mark against them the company and uh you know what kind of people work there what uh
[silence]
that's right that's right
right e[ven]- even if it is you know a company policy of uh 
immediate termination or whatever they still have to replace them
and uh there's there's a lot involved there
[silence]
i think i think the regular schedule stuff
um that when you say everybody get out of it that's a good point i never really thought of it that way
yeah they really can um i think the big the biggest problem i've got is is forcing it on someone after they've already
agreed to the terms of employment um as far as the new hires i- i hired on just early enough that i- i missed it um where the new hires were concerned but uh
not nobody no i don't think anybody questions that um testing someone as a as a as a pre condition to being hired but um for the conditions of employment to change while you're on the job that's 
i- i don't know that that's where i think that most people get upset it's uh yeah it it's changing the rules in the middle of the game basically and uh
it's just it it's a really tough question and it you know it people have have really quieted down after everything started but i still think there's a lot of there's a lot of resentment
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
you bet
[silence]
no that's right
yeah i- i know of some people who did uh it was it was indirectly related you know they could always come up with other reasons but it it had a lot to do with it just uh the the whole attitude because_1 it's really uh
it's just really it it seems so {unTI} you know with the the whole relaxed atmosphere that we have um to all of a sudden 
uh start forcing attitudes and whatnot you know there's not a lot of pressure to to vote the right way or anything else around TI like there like there is in some companies or at least you know from what i've heard but uh
yeah [laughter] um-hum no ab[solutely]- absolutely not you know it's it's it's if 
you know if you hired me i'll be you know supposedly you agreed with a majority of my views and my qualifications to begin with so uh you know let's let's stick with that original trust i guess huh
but uh it's it's still it it still remains a tough question and it's there's a lot of you know the whole the whole department of defense uh
reasoning behind the original plan and whatnot there's a lot of different things that uh come into play but that was i think everybody everybody pretty much knows that that was kind of a smoke screen to implement it throughout the whole company
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
i really don't think so yeah i really don't because some people are going to are are going to risk it um it may prevent
[silence]
[laughter] i- i guess i guess what i'm trying to get at is if it if it if it does help
a few individuals maybe maybe it's worth it um you know it may prevent somebody who was was teetering on the edge of experimenting or whatnot but uh
i don't know if you know the it's it's a needs of the few and the needs of the many type situation i don't know if everybody should have to sacrifice quite as much
there there's still a big question in my mind that the the absolute
refusal to accept the possibility of of mistakes on the testing is something that still bothers me it it's
[silence]
um-hum
um-hum absolutely and that i- i don't know if uh i don't know if everybody understands all the implications on that too e[ven]- even if you 
you know if you take uh a a drug that was presc[ribed]- prescribed for you but the the prescription has run out you still had some left and you happen to take an extra 
penicillin well penicillin's not on the list but you know yeah i- i think you understand what i'm getting at it it can still show up and it can still flag as a positive and and those kinds of things obviously that's not the intent
and uh those are the kinds of things that still can show up
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
that's right
[silence]
that's right i even had friends when i was going to college who were in uh
who are in pharmacy school and they could legally um provide medicine to their family mens fa[mily]- family members and friends certain medicines were were legal now i- i- i believe 
you know any of the any of the ones we would we would be tested for wouldn't be on those lists but uh um there were certain things that they could provide without a doctors prescription based on their qualifications and that can happen but uh
[silence]
yeah yeah i think so [laughter] you too good-bye 
[noise]


[silence]
well what's your views on it
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
sure
sure
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
uh-huh
yeah
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah we're not too far [noise] behind i graduated in seventy one so i'm i'm same generation
i i'm it's going to be a short conversation because i agree with you i i think uh [noise] i don't i don't even think it ought to be uh voluntary i think it ought to be mandatory
uh for kids to either either do military service or public service one of the two uh a lot of reasons for that not not just because i'm a i'm a hard ass or anything it's just that
like you say kids are getting out of high school not knowing what in the heck they're going to do
and either the military or public service organization can give them a lot of focus
and i think that it might stop us some problems later on i mean you know y[ou]- these kids will get their their heads on straight and and figure out what they want to do instead of hanging around street corners selling drugs or something
uh it's i think it would be good for them uh
it helps mature them a little bit and helps them understand the world the way it really is
[silence]
oh yeah
[silence]
oh yeah
year
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah
and and most of them aren't i mean you look you look at the number of marriages that are occurring right ou[t]- i mean even in high school
and you know y[ou]- you wonder where are the parents in all of this
you know why isn't somebody stepping in and and sto[p]- putting a stop to this
kids in high school are just too young to be married
they ha[ve]- they have no idea what the world is like they don't how tough it is out there to make a living
uh i mean i was in the same boat when i left high school i my parents wanted me to go straight to college and i didn't
you know i was ready i was ready i had wanderlust i wanted to get out and see some things
so i joined the Air Force and ended up staying there for thirteen years
um but i had lived in my own little bubble up until that time and and after traveling around the world a few times i realized that things ain't the way they seem
and i i did a lot of growing up there uh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah
that's right
[silence]
that's right
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
well you know it's just like you say there's so much stuff that needs to be done here in this country and uh you know if if you could have a thought of something like uh
like a uh uh a Peace Corps sort of organization i mean this would be so useful just in uh for instance just helping old folks
you know they you know they need help they don't have anybody to depend on and it would be nice to have somebody come over and cut their yard or paint their house or do minor repairs or something like that
and
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
uh
yeah
[silence]
yeah
yeah my mom's in the same position late sixties and and it got to the got to the point where i mean me and my brother both were were gone
and she couldn't maintain the house without large expenditures of money you know it finally got to a point where she just had to sell it and move into an apartment
and uh
i i'm not i'm not saying that that wouldn't have happened anyway but it would have been nice if there had been somebody to come around and take care of the little things
you know like the like the yard work and little repairs and
painting and stuff like that
[silence]
oh yeah
sure
[silence]
sure i mean i mean the kids who would be giving the service are going to get a lot more out of it than just money
you know that i i remember when i was a kid i used to do little little things for the old folks around the neighborhood and uh i know how it made me feel
you know you s[o]-
uh peo[ple]- people just don't help people anymore they're they're out for themselves 
[silence]
yeah
well that's that's the that's the point we've gotten to you know every time somebody wants something they always turn to the government
and y[ou]- the government's going to be limited i where are they going to get the money they're going to get it from us and we can do it a lot more efficiently than the government we don't need to add fourteen layers of bureaucracy to a program
[silence]
um the thing that Carter works on uh Habitat For Humanity i was involved in that w[as]- uh in Montgomery before i came up to North Carolina 
and uh it was it was a pretty neat little program we'd just go out and they would buy a plot of land and contractors and builders and everybody else would donate their their time
and uh the materials were at cost and we'd put up houses and that was kind that was kind of neat
i uh in a way i think it's a little bit inefficient but but it's better than nothing
and and at least i had the opportunity of seeing two families move into decent housing
um course on the other hand i can start complaining very loudly about people on public assistance who are quite capable of doing something for themselves but just won't
because it's far more advantageous for them to sit there and just draw uh welfare money than it is to work
uh we did a uh a cost comparison in one of my courses
and we took all the benefits that a family that a a married couple with two kids would get under welfare and what they would be making at minimum wage and they came out four thousand dollars better a year by taking welfare
so there's no incentive for them to do anything
far better for them to sit on their butts and draw the money
[silence]
you had to do something
yeah a[nd]- an[d]- and that's been tried that was tried in Alabama too and it got shot down
i d[on't]- and i don't understand the reasoning for it i really don't it it seems perfectly logical that if somebody's going to take public money
then they should return something to the public i mean if nothing else go out along an interstate and pick up garbage
[silence]
yeah what do they what do they do in Maryland do they use highway people or do they use prisoners
[silence]
yeah tha[t]- that's the way they did it in Alabama too
u[sually]- usually you'd see these big chain gangs out there [laughter] picking up trash
[silence]
uh-huh uh-huh yeah we have that here in North Carolina


[silence]
i think it's uh a good idea um i grew up uh my teenage years were spent during the sixties graduating uh high school in sixty eight 
um i remember when the Peace Corps movement first came about and i thought it was a very good idea at the time i was one of those uh Kennedy children if you know what i mean and uh
[silence]
right now i see a lot of kids who get out of school have no idea what they want to do
and there's a lot of things out there that we could do uh for our own country let alone other countries and i think that we've got the the people power to do it it's just uh we need
to channel it and focus it on some things that that need some fixing up um
some examples are this uh some of the things like Jimmy Carter's been involved in uh a little program to you know fix up housing for people
and there's a lot of housing ah i know in the area that i live in that's run down and beat up but it could be fixed up and used and it's just you know sitting there wasting away
[silence]
[laughter]
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah i think a lot of people grow up with uh with uh preconceived notions li[ke]- what the world's about
a lot of it has to do from too much TV
and uh you know it's there's there's a heck of a lot of difference between you know the intake that you get from TV and and movies and what you hear in school and then what reality is
uh i remember uh i've i've worked since i was well i started delivering papers when i was ten and i had a real job when i was thirteen so i've you know worked most of my life but i remember when i got out of high school
all through high school was boy i can't wait to get out of high school i can't wait to get out of high school and i wanted to go to college and i had the grades to go to college and i got accepted to college but when i got out of high school i kind of said
you know what am i going to do now you know it's like
you know when i actually started working full time and i i got married shortly after getting out of high school i uh thought i was smart ran away and got married
and uh i remember there was a time and within the first year of marriage i said boy wouldn't i give to get be back in school
and just have to do homework and and go work my part time job because life and the reality of working for a living and trying to make ends meet is just so overwhelming to someone
if they aren't prepared for it
[silence]
that's true
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah a
[silence]
um
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah i think once once kids get out and see how
other people really live and know how bad off some people really are and how good they've got it
and what it takes to have that good life a[nd]- if you're willing to work for it then they're probably be more inclined to work for it
[silence]
uh-huh exactly
[silence]
you know i've i've s[o]- i my my parents are in their late sixties now and um so many of the people that live around them are unable to do those things for themselves anymore
and it's
it's really hard on them and the you know the thought that i i see the uh the mall rats you know walking around the mall nothing better to do than just walk around the mall all day long when they could be doing something to help someone
and uh you know you there's a uh a nice warm feeling i remember getting out of doing things like that when i was younger i mean i was a Boy Scout and the whole bit and 
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah i think there'd there'd be a you know a uh economic benefit for you know everyone concerned those doing the work and those receiving the the uh the services
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah i think uh President Bush covered that in his uh State of the Union address this year when he said that you know it's time for 
you know the individuals to start thinking about what they can do to help each other out instead of counting on government to do everything
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
exactly
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
[noise]
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yes
[silence]
yes
[silence]
yes
[silence]
yeah one of the things they tried to push through in Maryland and uh weren't very successful was that if you were an able bodied person on welfare
you had to do some work and
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
that's exactly what they were trying to get them to do
[silence]
um both
[silence]
yeah they use both
[silence]
uh they have a they have another program in Maryland that's called Adopt-A-Highway 
[noise]


[silence]
so do you fish
[silence]
uh from a boat or from shore
[silence]
oh that's nice uh
mostly catfish or
[silence]
yeah a real light line real light rig well that sounds like fun
fish in Colorado s[o]- different than that mostly trout
in the mountains
yeah yeah mountain streams and rivers
uh yeah very yeah there isn't much there you know
[silence]
um by and large no but but they're big fun
[silence]
what
i i i'm a fly fisherman
yeah i i cast a ways i'm not highly proficient but it's fun
[silence]
well let me explain fly fly fishing to you then you're not casting a weight on the end of the line
you're casting the weight of the line
[silence]
yeah well the fly on the end weighs nothing it weighs less than the line
so what you do is you strip off oh four five six little rolls
coils of line into your hand
and you whip the line
as you whip it
over your head or side to side
you slowly feed out more and more
[silence]
well no no you fish upstream
right and then you let it carry it downstream
and then you reel it in and you do it again
[silence]
yeah exactly jump at it
uh
from what i'm seeing and hearing and all the the big pattern that's
really
looking forward for spring is the grub pattern
no no it it looks like a grub yeah okay whenever you yeah a lure a fly
whenever
you have a something that looks like something else
and it's a fly you call it a pattern
all right uh you know there's bumble bee patterns
there's excuse me uh there's bumble patterns there's mosquito patterns there's wasp patterns there's grub patterns uh
[silence]
uh you can buy them uh i've got some and
they seemed to have been hitting real heavy on it in Fall
[silence]
yeah yeah you know how that changes
the phase of the moon and
[silence]
yeah yeah i i
[silence]
you see i'm from west Texas
yeah
Lubbock
oh another west Texan
[silence]
yeah yeah
it
[silence]
it
it's kind of nice way to get away from everything for the day
[silence]
yeah it's
[silence]
well
there you fish mornings and evenings
and nights
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
it at times gets incredibly hot here
[silence]
June
[silence]
oh
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
fishing is not just just dragging fish out of the water it's it's a total experience you know getting out in nature and
hearing the crickets and listening to the birds and seeing the squirrels and camping out and eating out of doors and
[silence]
uh i probably ought to i just freeze
[silence]
yeah yeah well you know ankle deep or standing on the bank and slipping it out there
slipping it out there
you know i always intend to just stand on the bank and just kind of slip it out there and 
you know how it is the water's kind of
[silence]
and then you're in to it just a little bit and then you splash in and the next thing you know your knees are wet
[silence]
uh
got a stepdaughter she's real sweet and uh
at times she enjoys it at times not and
a fuzzy little dog
[silence]
oh
[silence]
yeah yeah
[silence]
yeah yeah
[silence]
yeah you guys sure want to be out of range
[silence]
it takes time yeah last year we had a oh just a wonderful trip up to Trappers Lake oh it was cold and rain the whole time and 
we still had a good time out of the deal
[silence]
uh
and Colorado is a beautiful place to live
[silence]
well and you've got to have you've got to work for a living to
[silence]
what division y'all in
[silence]
what division are y'all in
[silence]
oh
[silence]
well the only thing up here is division one
[silence]
oh yeah
[silence]
okay yeah
[silence]
oh fishing's fishing is fun up here it's not
it seems like the success ratio the success rate here is not as good as on some of the better lakes there but
it is fun you know it
the the experience is is better up here i think you know it seems more relaxing there's more to look at
[silence]
and and there's something about listening to water run that's relaxing to the soul
you know if you're if you're just sitting on a nice hot lake
[silence]
[laughter]
[silence]
yeah it it is interesting to watch that water rise all of a sudden
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah i[t]- it gets f[oamy]- foamy almost and you know it's just pure and pristine
and the froth and

[silence]
oh yeah my dad has a lake cabin and so we go there for the small lake uh
just outside of the Dallas Fort Worth area it takes us about three hours to get there and we go and we fish and we catch a bunch of junk [laughter] nothing nothing to talk about for the most part but it's fun
[silence]
from the dock from shore
[silence]
oh mostly we catch carp if we're doing good we catch a catfish or two once in a while and you know we go ahead and eat those but we've never caught enough to really have what you'd call a fish fry what we normally do is just uh go ahead and clean it up and then uh
you know put it in a bag and freeze it and and somebody takes it home and eats it then when there's just a couple people instead of a whole crowd usually there's a pretty good crowd there [laughter-so] we don't ever catch enough to eat carp is usually pretty much fun
because i've caught up to about an eight pound carp on a little you know a little pole with twenty pound test line and that that's a pretty good fight so that's a lot of fun
yeah
they fight hard
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah and in the rivers and stuff
[silence]
are they good to eat
[silence]
oh you mean size wise they're not very big
[silence]
yeah well i've been is that mostly uh fly fishing when you're doing that or are you fly fishing or are you using a bobber
yeah
[silence]
i've never even tried that my if i don't have a reel with a button on it i tend to get so much [laughter-backlash] [laughter-it's] not worth the [laughter-trouble]
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
with the little thing on the end yeah i thought it had a weight
[silence]
oh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
um
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
um
so you're fishing downstream so it will carry some
oh you fish upstream
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
you hope that they think it's a bug and
and eat it yeah
[silence]
that's a fish
[silence]
oh it's a it's a lure
[silence]
i see
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
oh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
um
did someone just come up with this design and and you're going to make one for yourself or are you going to buy it
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
oh it's just that that just happens to be what the fish like this year huh
um
[silence]
[laughter] i guess so we tend to use just bait and a few lures but bait tends to work the best just some blood bait
oh are you where are you from oh i'm from Midland
i went to college at Tech so you've been out to Buffalo Gap fishing
yeah i've been up there
i didn't catch anything but i've been up there [laughter]
[silence]
yeah it's fun it's lazy take a picnic lunch i used to do that with my dad every once in a while we'd go out on a Saturday and just spend the day before it got too hot
[silence]
yeah [laughter] yeah we do most of our fishing at night
just from the heat of it all that's one advantage you've certainly got on us
[silence]
it does i've only been up there once in the summer well no i've been up there twice in the summer but both times it was really pleasant in fact it snowed on us in in
gosh when was that we were in Mesa Verde Park and it was like the end of Ju[ne]- it was just before July fourth 
and it was twenty eight twenty nine degrees we were out in this silly tent with regular little sleeping bags not knowing any better [laughter] and here it went and it froze and it snowed on us 
we did not know what to do about it
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
do you
yeah
do you have to do you wear waders when you fish
[silence]
oh goodness it must be a little bit cold
that's cold water around there
[silence]
um
do you have any
[silence]
oh i see
[silence]
yeah and you get you get a little more carried away with it and you move a little closer
[silence]
yeah
[laughter] do you have any kids that you take fishing
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
[laughter] i have a three and a half year old and a one and a half year old and the little one of course is could care less the uh three and a half year old has just gotten to the point we got him a little pole last year and just put uh
his big thing last year was throwing it in the water and reeling it up [laughter] that was what he considered fishing [laughter] this year he's gotten to where he can we we were at a friend's uh stock pond we were out at their farm
and and they had been fishing and let him use the pole while we wal[ked]- we all walked off a healthy hundred yards or so and let him fish and he started trying to cast it
so he he was kind of getting there but he's
he's at a dangerous point [laughter-right] [laughter-now] he understands the mechanics of pushing the button and throw but not necessarily the direction it's going to go in
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah well that's good
[silence]
oh yeah my husband would like to live there but i don't know all of our family is here so
[silence]
well yeah but TI is up there so [laughter] that part of it would probably work out
i'm sorry what
we're both uh i was uh military but he's division three
it goes back and forth Division well maybe division one right now he's in computers
so and he's in school and everything else i have some friends who work up there
Kathy and Kevin Guy
yeah and they like to fish they've been inviting us to come up there in the summer her dad has a cabin and they go fishing up there
so that would be neat to try it some time
[silence]
yeah long as you have a good time that's the main point so
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
[laughter] definitely more to look at 
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah the only thing you've got to watch is when that creek comes up we camped next to one one time when we were there a couple of summers ago
and we figured we were up a long way off and then it rained that night and we thought well wonder how far off we are and we got up the next day and that creek that had been fifty or sixty feet from our site of our tent was now about
three feet away and it's like oh well maybe we ought to move just a touch so that was kind of funny
[silence]
yeah i just love the way it looks i could almost just watch the wa[ter]- we in fact we have gotten out on on trips before and just stopped and watched it because there was so much and if you were there i mean it was
one time we were there and i guess it was late May so it was really your spring almost you know at even though it was it was really summer down here and and the i guess the creek the mountains were really starting to melt and the creek was just wild just running
and and all the white water and noise and the it was just beautiful
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah
[silence]

[silence]
well thanks for being home uh on the weekend i uh i'm actually working at night and uh
there very few people that are on the list for calls uh on the weekends nights
[silence]
are are you part of the school system out there
[silence]
uh the reason i said that because i've had about uh three calls and my daughter had one too from different students out of North Carolina i guess they pass the names amongst your computer students or whatever
[silence]
oh is that ri[ght]- great great
[silence]
oh is that right that's wonderful
[silence]
oh yeah i talked to one we're not on the subject of course i talked to one i think he had a whole bunch of calls he had a roommate that had calls and everything he had way more twice as many calls as as i've made uh
and i i'm of course we at TI just hoping it works out that the new products that they come out will uh sell like gang books bu[sters]- busters really
okay you first on the subject wha[t]- what do you think about Latin America
Latin America yeah
oh really
TI had a place i'm not to sure i don't think they do anymore down i think it was Campinas i'm not sure and uh i guess we were selling parts to the automotive industry or whatever and they had quite a few
locations not quite a few several uh in Latin America i think the one in Mexico is closed and i think the one in Brazil is closed but i
i don't know why that is a problem down there and i guess the crime rate is terrible up here too and uh
and some people say go to New York but i don't i don't have an answer to the crime rate it's sad that is a sad situation i i'd like to go down to Mexico you know and i keep hearing that you know the government and and the crime rates pretty high too that that is sad
uh not that we can uh sell any great program we have with crime but uh i think uh i'm kind of like you i don't have any strong opinions on it i guess maybe that's our biggest problem we have with our our neighbors down there is that we don't have any we have more
i guess ties we in the United States have more ties to Europe and everything and we don't really aren't that close to everyone in South America i don't really know why though
[silence]
right
[silence]
right yeah i know that i saw in a book i was reading a Spanish book uh not that i read Spanish you know i just you know reading some Spanish words and there was a comment in there about
the Mexicans don't really want us to say we're Americans they would like to say that we're North Americans because they're Americans too you know and i guess that's true we don't think of
any one else but oursel[ves]- i guess we're kind of uh the smart asses in the world i suppose uh or of America anyway we think of ourselves as the only Americans when they're Americans too
[silence]
as Mexicans yes that that
[laughter]
[silence]
no no i know
[silence]
yeah no i mean they were saying that of us that we're the North Americans and they're Americans they they we always say we're Americans and they they want us to say we're the North Americans we're not Americans we're North Americans and they're South Americans yeah
whatever i i don't want to make i read it somewhere though it's not my point i guess [laughter]
[silence]
no no they they were lucky enough to have some oil what ten years ago an and they they blew all that and borrowed enou[gh]- more money than they can pay back now and uh
uh so they're not exactly business men i do think we should deal more with them i don't i do have a lot of sympathy in that we're here in Texas uh for the language you know is very foolish
i'm relative relatively familiar with Texas school system and we should teach Spanish at least in uh grammar school you know four or five grades of it so that we can speak Spanish i think that helps
when you certainly can speak their language uh and there are problems with you know the wet back problem you know for everyone knows what we're talking about when say wet back problem and then we should somehow
uh and i think the governments are working on that to try to have some uh businesses uh at the borders of both sides so that you can you don't have this problem of them trying to come up here and to to get the jobs you know there there may be some organized way to do this
i i do feel for them uh they are very envious of us or they wouldn't be coming up here you know risking a lot not that they're risking their lives of course but risking a lot uh getting thrown back i guess is all that uh happens
you probably don't see that where we see it you know once a month i'm sure in San Antonio they see it more often than that
okay well you see it saw it out there then too
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
i think a a common factor to a lot of problems both whether it be crime if if you want to jump on that is mostly uh poverty uh and i think a lot of their problems is poverty if we could
uh uh the problems we have you know in this country is is a lot of it's poverty whether it's the people aren't trying hard enough to get out of poverty i that's another story but uh uh it is sad there there's so much down in all of South America
uh so much potential you know we're TI of course is is really pushing world markets in their products and they're they're mostly in in Europe now and in in in the Orient Japan and Singapore now just announced
building a plant in Singapore uh they're in Taiwan and Japan and they're they haven't had what that much luck in South America and there's got to be a lot of potential for business down there for the products certainly that we make and everything
and there's got to be trade i guess that's some of the answer i guess is business uh uh and i try to be an optimist and say well that that's one way is to help any problem whether it be crime or certainly poverty obviously is to is to get some business going between each other
and we need we need to do more of that uh somehow and encourage more business between us
they've got to have a lot of resources i would think an enormous amount of of well potential that way a lot of it of course is hot and jungle and all that but uh there's got to be a lot of potential down there
[silence]
what are what are you taking in school i didn't ask you that
what are you taking in school
oh you you're an instructor yeah you're an instructor yeah you said
[silence]
that's great are you
teaching Computer Science wha[t]- you said what were you saying you were teaching there
great great
[silence]
right
i of course i work at TI and i'm a little puzzled as to why when they get my voice one time why that isn't enough i mean i'm i'm i'm getting a kick out of the whole program but uh
there's going to be i guess thousands i don't know how many thousands or tens of thousands of these recordings and i wonder how they're going to analyze them whether it would be
listening to them or analyzing i g[uess]- they've got to be analyzing with a a voice recorder some how
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
right
[silence]
oh yes i know they change with age i know mine changes uh has changed uh although you you never found your your voice echoes in your own head which is makes it different than what it really sounds to other people
uh i'm sure singers and professional people know that and you always hear your own voice in recordings and say my God that's that's not obviously that's not me you know
but uh i know your voice in your own head resonates a different way
[silence]
uh go ahead you you comment on it yeah i'm glad that you're in the business that i know TI's gotten with their Speak and Spell and everything i've told my wife that one of the reasons they're doing it is because eventually you'll be able to talk to your computer you wouldn't have to have a keyboard
you'll be able to just give it commands and i'm sure they have some of that now and not not in computers but a lot of potential of course for handicapped people

[silence]
uh-huh yeah well sometimes i'm home and sometimes i'm not but if i am it's always fun to talk
[silence]
i am as a matter of fact i'm at uh North Carolina State
[silence]
yeah i think i was the one who did that actually
yeah i had a uh i teach a course in Voice I O Systems
[silence]
so i know uh you know i know about this project so i got my students to sign up and uh apparently a number of them have been participating
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
uh let's see the subject is Latin America
i don't know whether i have any real profound thoughts about that i actually wa[s]- was planning a trip to Latin America and i got warned off by
some people they say Peru can't be traveled to and the crime rate in Brazil makes it not a pleasant place to go and so on and so forth
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah i i don't understand it either although i i think a lot of South Americans
regard the United States as as bullying and uh that's certainly from a historical point of view
would be true i mean certainly we took far more from Mexico than Saddam Hussein ever dreamed of taking in in his wildest dreams from his neighbors
[silence]
yeah well i think they're going to have that's a tough row for them to to hoe because i think most of the world is going to regard
uh citizens of the United States as Americans and citizens of Mexico as Mexicans and they can stand on their heads if they want too but i don't think that they're going they're going to change that and
and and really i mean North Americans i think are when you say that even i think i mean i tend to think of Americans and Canadians i just don't think of Mexicans as being North Americans although i guess strictly speaking they are
[silence]
oh i see
[silence]
i don't know
[silence]
yeah well it's it's so interesting i ju[st]- i just don't think Mexico's problems are going to be cured by semantics
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
well i grew up in Los Angeles
and uh in fact i drove a cab when i was a graduate student so i i knew uh
the Hispanic part of LA pretty well
and certainly you know knew that problem knew you know knew about apartment houses that would have eight or ten or twelve people living in them sleeping in the same bed in shifts and all that
and uh
it was
it was pretty wild
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah
i'm sorry
well i am actually
yeah i'm the
i'm the teacher i give [laughter]
as it were
[silence]
yeah i'm in Computer Science
and uh very interested in voice systems and in speech recognition but of course this project is really one to collect a data base of
of uh of casual speech uh in an attempt to get some kind of a model of what speech is like
[silence]
yeah well they record these and then somebody transcribes them so that they they have uh they have a speech signal and what and what is said
and they have a they're able to average it over a number of different occasions because peoples voices change a lot even from morning to evening and that's uh a big problem in speech recognition
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
right
[silence]

[silence]
i think we're overtaxed to the hilt [noise]
yeah i mean we're we're taxed on taxes and um
uh most all government entities are just trying to give us a state
income tax for those who don't have it that is i mean we don't have one yet but eventually they may try to push it through
[silence]
no no state income tax
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah i think what needs to be done is they need to control their spending habits
[silence]
right
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
well we're
really overburdened from federal state and local
that it takes such a size out of your paycheck that
[silence]
there's not a whole lot you can always do with your paycheck
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
well they're kind of put into a trap of being
out there to please the special interest groups as well
and uh i think the only way that can be changed for us to get a a better tax revenue
that's fairness and all is for us to limit their terms
[silence]
and by doing so they're not obligated to anybody
[silence]
and uh
[silence]
and uh i don't know how we're going to do that right away though but what what in general though that taxes are doing to us is
[silence]
it's just taking uh [noise] a bite out of our savings
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
and i believe the Social Security tax is a great {pondsy} scheme
[silence]
yeah it's uh you know right now they're robbing from it to pad the federal deficit
[silence]
and i bet that's illegal see if uh most company uh CEOs were to do that
within their private company they'd be in jail
[laughter] so how are we letting them get away with it
[silence]
right
[laughter]
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
a lot of people have become too complacent and believe everything is just the norm as to the way things are going and
feel absolutely helpless
to
to oppose a lot of the situations going on
in the taxing system
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah
hum
[silence]
well there's no quick solution or no sure fire
easy answer
it's just going to take uh
[silence]
uh really uh uh uh
a combination effort i think of the majority of the American people to
[silence]
come to a decisive answer
or
vote
to
limit
the way it's spent
see we we're we have no say so as to where the money goes in the first place that's
[silence]
right and they are controlled or
pretty much do what they want to do
[silence]
well they feel invu[lnerable]- invulnerable to uh
any wrath or uh it's it's occurred so many times that
they figure people will usually forget and
don't think about it when the election time arises
[silence]
and generally it does work out that way
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
well when you get out into the real world then you will know
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
bonus time you have a bonus
[silence]
oh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
so you're taxed on the bonuses too right
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh sales is lucrative but then you're paying really high taxes when you're doing a lucrative job
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
well i have
i guess about said what all all i can think of to say
[silence]
yeah it's re[ally]- a rather touchy topic at that but [laughter]
[silence]
well that's great
you too and uh have a good day
[noise]

[silence]
so uh what do you think [laughter]
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
oh really so they have n[o]- i didn't realize they had no state tax in Texas
[silence]
oh that's great because they don't have it in Florida in New York they have it
i mean you know like i say i'm in New York and we have a state tax as well
so that just cuts even more
[silence]
right i i think that i i mean i wouldn't be so upset about the amount of taxes paid if it weren't for the fact that they don't they don't go to any place
you know y[ou]- you don't see it going to any place where it belongs
i think if it were to be uh
if it were to be um
if it were to be hold hold on a second please someone just walked in the door
[noise]
if if it were to spent in the right way i think wouldn't be so upset about it but given that it's not spent properly i think it's a major problem
[silence]
well that's certainly true well what is it they were just talking about um
sort of middle income you know how how middle income people what winds up happening is for instance having kids you know they wind up having kids as a deduction and after
but the deduction is so little for kids that they wind up having to pay more in taxes than it costs to raise a kid for the year or something
i think tha[t]- so they want to you know try an[d]- i think they're trying i think tha[t]- i think that most of the politicians understand this
they just don't they're just not very good at doing what they're supposed to be doing
[silence]
right
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
i agree
i agree
[silence]
right exactly and then and then uh
uh i'm i'm just not sure if i see you know if i see it going like i say to the right places i mean it'd be it'd be one thing if it were taking a bite out of your savings and then you were getting it all back when you got older
you know but i'm not convinced that's a that that Social Security is doing as well as it should and
you know and and and uh and and that you know those people who need it for welfare and so forth who really need it for welfare not the eighty five to ninety percent of them who don't need it but i mean the real people who really need it
you know should be getting it but instead i think it's going to the wrong places
[silence]
you think so
[silence]
i know and that scares the hell out of me
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah i don't i don't well becau[se]- because they're the ones who make the laws [laughter] so who's going to yell at them you know it'd be nice if we sort of as one band together and and uh and an performed a citizens arrest i guess
to see if we could sort of clean them up and you know but i don't know if we can do that or not
[silence]
i agree i agree but um yeah like like you said i wonder you know if if it's certainly not going to be a slow change process and i wonder if it'll ever be a change process
i sort of i sort of get discouraged when i think about all the things that i think are wrong
you know all those things that really could be changed that
aren't you know that that aren't and taxes is one of those things that just sort of sits way up there on the list
[silence]
so i don't know i i i have no idea what to do about it
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
right we don't i mean the only say so we have is supposedly by electing people who we think are going to vote one way of another
[silence]
right
i've never quite understood that i've never uh you know even though um i i've never been
uh sort of politically minded but it's never been clear to me as to sort of
um
you know how Congressmen an can can just sort of go ahead and vote their own conscience as their own ideas
when clearly their constituency doe[s]- doesn't back them up on anything you know
and often times that will happen
[silence]
right
[silence]
right
[silence]
they do forget it's true coul[d]- because everybody think of what happens is whenever the politic[ian]- whenever th[e]- the one who made that supposed mistake turns around and uh his his or her opponent can say well look they did this and they can turn around and say well my opponent did this
so it becomes uh
a general battle of
the w[ho]- sort of the election of the lesser of two evils
i think so
i don't know
i just uh i'm unhappy with it but and well i'm i'm sort of semi fortunate right now i'm a graduate student
so i don't make that much what i make isn't taxed very highly because i'm still in school
but
it's
my my my wife has a real job and you know when i get her job um you know we we look at her paycheck i'm just floored when i see how little of it we're actually allowed to keep
[silence]
especially around bonus time
bonus she no my my wife does
my wi[fe]- i don['t]- no graduate students don't get bonuses we're lucky to get paychecks the way i figure
[silence]
my my wife is taxed on her bonus as well and that's a
that's usually a big chunk of her bonus check actually i mean her bonus isn't that much but they tax it as i i guess they tax it as if
that were her weekly check or something
so she gets destroyed on her bonus check
so she works with in in in sales
so a good portion of her you know her salary is is quarterly bonuses
[silence]
yes well yeah she's not entirely sales so it isn't it isn't as lucrative as one would hope but it it keeps us supported temporarily
until i can get a real salary and then get taxed more
so i don't know i d[on't]- i guess i guess at this point in time we're just sort of going to have to live with it
and hope that it gets better
[silence]
same here tough topic so
[silence]
i believe i i i do agree with you most most wholeheartedly it's been a pleasure talking with you
thanks for calling
you too bye-bye
[silence]

[noise] okay [laughter]
i'll let you go ahead [laughter]
[silence]
oh uh-huh
[silence]
oh
[silence]
that's great i always thought it'd be great to have twins
[silence]
well yeah [laughter]
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
your first ones you mean it was this way
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
oh
right
[silence]
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
huh
[silence]
that's difficult yeah
[silence]
uh-huh [laughter] it happens that way [laughter]
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
um uh-huh
[silence]
Texas is much worst for the drugs i mean it was bad enough every place else but drugs is in Texas are extremely bad
[silence]
uh-huh
uh-huh
well that's all you can do
[silence]
well i i was going to ask too does your wife work
[silence]
uh-huh she just recently started working then
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
huh
oh uh-huh uh-huh
so that sounds great well uh we also have five children
and but ours are all out of the nest [laughter] so uh as when they were growing up i probably we had a lot of similar things l[ike]- like you had
you know having the time when you have younger ones to take care of
you maybe sometimes do not take as much time for the older ones but uh we were we're very active of course at church and uh Boy Scouting and Girl Scouts Four H
uh and those activities helped a lot in giving us things to do with the children
and uh we try to take a vacation with them every year camping of some sort something that wasn't expensive
and uh
[silence]
our youngest is uh expecting her first baby so they're they're all out and on their own they're and we have one to get married yet [laughter] and they'll all be married
uh and they're they're all doing pretty good they uh two lives in Pittsburgh you probably don't know where that is
okay two of our children live there uh one i like i said lives near Maryl[and]- in in around Maryland DC he works right on the border of DC
and one lives in Connecticut and our baby lives just a mile over the hill [laughter] so we'll get to see her a little more than uh what we do the other ones
[silence]
uh-huh well they have to
yeah
[silence]
uh-huh uh-huh
[silence]
to go to follow uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
yeah
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
and that does make a big difference
[silence]
uh-huh
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh that's that's well none of us are let's face it you know we're not none of us like they por[tray]- portray it on those shows i mean life's much more difficult than that
and uh
[silence]
right right now our daughter our well she's our second oldest she has she's the only that other one that has children she has two boys and she works full time
and i have mixed feelings about that she's able to do that and i don't know if she'd be happy to stay at home
but yet on the other hand i i've got the mixed feelings that i think you should be at home with your children i'm kind of old fashioned i guess that way but they seem to they seem to give uh quality time
to those children when they are together and and so it seems it seems for them that it works out all right
so i don't know i i don't think i ever would have had what it would take to work full time and raise a family i
yeah
[silence]
uh-huh
uh-huh
[silence]
yes it does it it yeah
[silence]
yeah what line of work are you in now since you went to school and
[silence]
oh okay okay a lot of the people i've that's call[ed]- i've talked to work for uh
for the same
uh
[silence]
uh-huh
which your income would be a lot better now
yeah
[silence]
uh-huh uh-huh
[silence]
right
and it's kind of a waste of a person
you know
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh uh-huh and you you recognized this and was able to you know do something about it
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
well it puts a strain on everybody your wife and your family
and the only thing you can remember is to [laughter] try and stay together as much as you can because it's very easy to uh become go your own direction when you're s[o]- when you're working so hard and going to school too
[silence]
well that's wonderful
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh it sounds to me like uh you're doing well my husband's retired so uh he's been retired for three years now yeah that's quite a change
[silence]
oh well he made it at fifty [laughter] it was a magic number for him and and uh he went at fifty and he still works part time at other thing you know
same job as he was doing only he's retired and doing it independently but uh
[silence]
nevertheless retired
[silence]

[noise]
okay i uh i have five children all together
uh my oldest two are already out and about in the world and i uh have a set of twins that are fourteen and uh my youngest is twelve
[silence]
uh yeah if you like doing everything twice
uh at any rate um
my first two children uh
i didn't spend a whole lot of time with them
um and you know was a a problem with having five children needing to work a uh a full-time job that was more than a full-time job i worked about fifty one hours a week because i worked every worked eleven hours every Sunday 
and uh so i didn't get to spend as much time with them as i as i should have as i really wanted to
yeah the yeah the f[amily]- well it was with all of them but it was uh more an impact i think on the oldest two
because um
oh about the time i got out of working
that long hours was when the uh when the twins were about three years old and uh they never you know i don't think they
noticed i wasn't around that much you know with all the children around the house it's kind of hard to notice that dad isn't around very much um
so what i've tried to do uh now
that i've uh fi[nally]- went back to school and got my degree when i was thirty years old and uh so
then i came out and was making as much money forty hours a week as i did fifty one hours a week so i've tried to spend more time with uh the children since then um what i'm currently doing is uh taking a lot of time um 
helping the kids more with their homework in the evenings um we just started a thing where every other week we go to uh movies there's a movie theater that offers dollar movies on Wednesday nights
and so every couple of weeks we will go to the movies because that's how often they change the movies and
it's working out pretty well um we're spending more time together i feel like i'm a lot closer to the three that are still living at home than i ever was to the two that were living there before um 
and in fact i found that i'm a lot closer with uh i have one son who's gone and i don't even know where he's at um he's taken off for parts unknown but uh yeah a[nd]- and uh my
daughter is um
has moved out of the house her and i get along a lot better now that she's moved [laughter] out of the house [laughter]
[laughter]
and uh so it's it's it's
it's been difficult to try to find the time and i think it's important that we do because um i notice that uh when i had spent two years down in Dallas down there they all have a uh
a me kind of attitude
and i noticed parents not spending time with their children and and going out and doing things and you know i knew like the kids next door were all into cocaine and
you know it just you know i saw the family falling apart down there
[silence]
yeah and so i think it's kind of important that i that i you know nurture the relationship i have with my children now and i'm doing my best to keep that up
[silence]
yeah what's your been your experience
[silence]
um she didn't up until the last oh six months
uh
she just recently started working uh she worked a job until we moved to our new house and uh she quit that job because it was too inconvenient and uh she starts a new job tomorrow which should take her out of the house about four days a week
[silence]
huh
[silence]
[laughter]
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
certainly do
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
[laughter]
[silence]
yeah that sounds great i've i've noticed uh another thing um when i was younger my father was always working and
yeah and uh you know he uh he worked a full-time job and a part-time job and i never saw him so i didn't have much of a role model to go by
you know to learn how to be a a father and a parent
and that kind of thing because i i can't ever remember playing ball with my dad or catch with my dad or doing anything with my dad
[silence]
yeah and it if you don't have i don't i it's my feeling that if you don't have a role model to follow then it's kind of tough you know everybody's not Father Knows Best
yeah but
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah i mean the the the capability to uh create children doesn't necessarily mean you have the uh the mental capacity to raise them [laughter] and
[silence]
yes
[silence]
yes it's it's not easy i've uh you know i've helped out extremely
uh well i can't say that but i've helped out [laughter] as best i could at home and uh y[ou]- as you know with five children it takes a lot of work
even if even if someone's home all the time there's still a lot of things that have to be done
[silence]
uh well now i work for Texas Instruments so so i'm in computers
[silence]
yeah and so i've uh prior to that i uh i worked in a food store
and uh you know wor[k]-
[silence]
uh right
yeah it uh it was uh it was a a smart move to make um i was more intelligent than the position i was holding
and uh it was
[silence]
yes i i felt that it certainly was i mean i was smarter than most of the people that i was working for and uh you know every time something new came up i was explaining it to them and uh i had
[laughter] yeah i uh
yeah i uh started back to school in fact i was going to school while i was working fifty one hours a week and that's why i you know if you're working if you're taking twelve credits at night and you're working fifty one hours a week there's not much time left to spend with 
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
[laughter]
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah well it it all paid off um so uh you know i got my degree and got the better paying job and
and uh
you know we i think as a family we're a lot better off
[silence]
uh-huh
[noise]
yeah well my goal is to try to retire by the time i'm fifty five
[silence]
great
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
well i'm

[silence]
[vocalized-noise]
right um
we eat out quite a bit it's just my husband and i at home now so
[silence]
oh at least once a week
we're we're retired now when we working out we ate out more than [laughter-that] [laughter]
[laughter]
uh
[silence]
uh-huh
well what type of restaurant do you like Richard
[silence]
[laughter]
[silence]
right
[silence]
oh have you we like Chinese we eat a lot of Chinese food
[silence]
uh-huh
what do you look for in a restaurant
[silence]
you what you
oh i [laughter]
[silence]
right
[silence]
i know what you mean i like some ambience and 
i like good food i don't like fast food [laughter-hamburgers] and all of [laughter-that] [laughter]
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
right uh-huh i don't care to go to a place just
for the price of it huh
i mean it's uh continental French restaurant or something really
with high prices and seven courses isn't what i usually look [laughter-for]
[laughter]
it isn't no that isn't what i look for [laughter]
[silence]
right [laughter]
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
presentation and
[silence]
well like
we we've been eating some in a restaurant that that just changed hands recently and we're trying to give them a little patronage but
Sunday we went there and i had a
pretty good meal of grilled pork chops and a baked apple
[silence]
and potatoes
but i said if they would just add a little bit of cranberry sauce or something like that [laughter]
[laughter]
yeah that's what i mean by right uh-huh
it would mean a lot to the looks of the plate
[silence]
Tex-Mex [laughter]
[laughter]
[silence]
right i know
[silence]
uh
we have a daughter in Texas and one in New Mexico and we've really gotten to like we like the real Mexican food better than the Tex-Mex
[silence]
right
[silence]
it's all pretty good isn't it [laughter]
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
right uh-huh that's true
[silence]
i'm originally from Maine so we like seafood too and that's something we don't get here and we're in the mountains in Virginia
and most of the seafood's frozen
[silence]
right
[silence]
uh-huh true lots of shrimp
[silence]
i know [laughter-it]
[silence]
[laughter] i know the feeling [laughter]
we do the same thing my son-in-law is a Texan and when he goes to Maine he eats lobster i guess at least twice a day all the time he's up there [laughter]
[laughter]
oh yes yeah it's like
[silence]
two ninety eight a pound for a pound lobster
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
oh yeah or cheaper right yeah a lot of the restaurants you can get
two pou[nd]- two one pound lobsters for like ten ninety nine
[silence]
[laughter]
[silence]
[laughter]
yeah it's a good place to go
[silence]
lots of little restaurants too with home cooked food that up there
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
right uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
we went to Gal[veston]-
[silence]
we were in Galveston last year aft[er]- right aft[er]- well the first of this year actually
and uh ate in a restaurant and they claimed to have the best shrimp on the Gulf Coast
[silence]
no it wasn't on the way across Louisiana we pulled off we saw a billboard and just pulled off taking a chance on a place
and they had it was a small restaurant just kind of out of the way
and they were set up with two buffets one for their regular Sunday chicken and roast beef and vegetables and everything and then one complete seafood buffet
[laughter]
that was the best shrimp i have ever had in my life they had shrimp fixed probably six different ways
[silence]
uh-huh right it was wonderful
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh i tried it but i didn't care for it not there but at my brothers i tried it
[silence]
that's probably true it
[silence]
i wasn't hungry it wasn't a meal we just he went down and bought some at a local place that steams them just so we'd try them
[laughter]
[silence]
probably needed some cold beer with it and [laughter]
[silence]
quite a bit
[silence]
oh
[silence]
right
we used to do that once in a while but we don't anymore
[silence]
uh-huh it's fun but it's just so much food [laughter] hate to come away feeling uncomfortable
[laughter]
[silence]
do you well that makes a difference
[silence]
where do you go to brunches like hotels or
restaurants there
[silence]
oh yeah uh-huh
[silence]
we eat at Shoney's
[silence]
oh
[silence]
uh-huh that sounds nice
[silence]
right i imagine it is
[silence]
[vocalized-noise] 
[silence]
uh uh-huh
[silence]
whe[re]- out of which direction f[rom] out of which direction from there west uh-huh
yeah

[noise]
so eating out
what are you interested in in restaurants
[silence]
oh
uh once a week twice a week
[silence]
yeah i understand
[silence]
uh but we both work and we have a daughter and
we normally manage to eat out once a week anyway
[silence]
uh
really i'm kind of open on food i'm
what you might call a culinary adventurer i'll
[silence]
i'll try anything once 
been on a real barbecue kick lately
yeah
[silence]
[noise]
excuse me uh
yeah
we usually have Chinese once a month
[silence]
uh
i hate franchised restaurants
i despise franchised restaurants i- i
always prefer to go to
something that seems more family run uh
[silence]
some place where you
seem to have the attitude like you're going into their home for dinner almost
[silence]
i don't
[silence]
but i don't like something fake or put on either uh
you know if i could have the the good small restaurant or a good large restaurant i'd go to the good small restaurant
[silence]
and
[vocalized-noise] i don't know why that is
[silence]
i think it's probably due to
[silence]
pricing often
[silence]
well yeah yeah
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
it is what you usually look oh isn't isn't
uh
[silence]
i try to 
get my money's worth
[silence]
and uh
not just that i try to
[silence]
well that's a big part of it i try to get my money's worth
you know
and not just in quantity you know but but quality and and
flavor and texture and care
[silence]
well presentation's not always all of it either it's it's important
but
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
yeah yeah something a little extra
and just for color if nothing else
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
what i miss up here is
i'm originally a Texan
and i'm
miss
[silence]
home cooked Mexican yeah yeah home cooked Tex-Mex uh Mexican restaurants where
[silence]
it's not owned by an Anglo or a corporation
[silence]
and
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
well there's real Mexican food and there's real Tex-Mex Mexican you know by
third or fourth generation Americans
of the Hispanic heritage
[silence]
oh yes [vocalized-noise] and and there's big differences of course and
[silence]
of course when you talk about Mexican cuisine you that's kind of like talking about American food or or a Chinese food because
[silence]
its regional too
[silence]
you know
[noise]
ah [noise]
[noise]
ah yeah that's [noise] the way it is here in Colorado also
no fresh [noise] or almost no fresh seafood
and
[noise]
[noise] in Texas we got it from the Gulf [noise]
[noise] and
yeah here a couple years ago my wife and i went to Seattle on vacation
[silence]
and i think everything except breakfast was seafood for almost a week and it was
[silence]
i was like a man starving at every meal
[silence]
ha
[silence]
it's a lot cheaper there isn't it lobster
[silence]
it's like shrimp on the Gulf
[silence]
two ninety eight a pound
that's as cheap as steaks some places
i mean in a grocery store yeah
[silence]
oh my gosh [noise] i've got to go to Maine then i you may have sold a trip for some time
[silence]
uh it sounds wonderful uh so
[silence]
that sound good i
down in the Gulf i've eaten a bunch of those little
[silence]
oh seafood shacks we've called them
[silence]
and
[silence]
uh it's just it so much different than to eat something that's been frozen
[silence]
you know
[silence]
shrimp straight out of the b[ay]- bay 
[silence]
hm
[silence]
was it true
[silence]
um
[silence]
[laughter]
[laughter]
uh yes the cajuns
[silence]
they can they can do things to shrimp that that no one else can so have you eaten crawfish yet
[silence]
oh as with anything it's preparation
[silence]
uh
[silence]
uh-huh
it there's all kinds
[silence]
[laughter]
so you do eat out a lot
[silence]
uh one of our other
real problems with going out to eat Sunday morning brunches
[silence]
you know Sunday brunch all all you can eat brunches
[silence]
uh we still find it fun
but
well am
i work in machine shop and do a lot of physical labor
[silence]
and so
[silence]
uh
yeah uh actually one of our
one of our favorites is a chain
Shoney's
[silence]
and in spite of the
[noise] and in spite of the fact i've spoken so badly about chains chain restaurants uh
[noise]
we uh do like Shoney's pretty well but then there's a
[silence]
place up the pass up in the mountains
that we pretty reliably like to go to on some Sunday mornings
drive drive up to i think it's about
eight thousand foot elevation and
and
and drive through Woodland Park and
go for a short drive in the mountains and have breakfast and
it it
[silence]
it's the way to spend a a nice Sunday morning
[silence]
i think it's as much the the trip to the mountains as it is the breakfast brunch you know [vocalized-noise] and it's not that far it's thirty miles
[silence]
the Colorado Springs what
west west out of Colo[rado]-

[noise] 
um-hum
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
i think i agree with that very much i do you
[silence]
i do you think a lot of people when they are listening to a trial put themselves
in a position like that and say i would never do something like that and it's hard for them to believe that somebody else could do the things that have been done
[silence]
um-hum um-hum
[silence]
i never have either
uh-huh
uh is there a reason why you have never
uh-huh my husband works as a policeman so i always assumed that that was why i was never called uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
uh-huh uh do they have such a thing now as a six man jury
somebody told me the other day that there is wha[t]- what they call a six man jury and i had never heard of such thing and i wondered if it was true
[silence]
i never had either but i just wondered uh another question was uh should a criminal case uh should the jury be unanimous on their decision
and that i wasn't sure on either whether it should be unanimous or not
[silence]
that would mean they all would have to decide
one way or the other
uh-huh
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
yeah yeah
[silence]
um-hum um-hum um-hum
[silence]
bring some of these things out um-hum
[silence]
uh apparently there are i i i since my husband worked as a policeman i can't believe there are very many
people that come to trial that have are not guilty of something some part of whatever they're accused of i have i still have a little bit of a problem with that uh but i would suppose there are circumstances you're in the wrong place at the right time or know the per[son]- wrong person at the right time
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
ah um-hum
[silence]
um-hum um-hum
[silence]
they still found him guilty
when people said he was at work
[silence]
uh-huh
well
[silence]
uh-huh
yeah
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
oh for heaven's sake so there's nine years of that man's life gone um-hum
no huh-uh yeah i guess that's where a lot of the problem lies we're we tr[y]- bend over backwards protecting the guilty people the one's that are on trial
and yeah
and we often forget about the one that the injustice has been done to
because i bet they still say our system is the best in the world
[silence]
yeah it's the best one that exists i guess so
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
oh i think a lot of people are i think they've lost sight of some things that are very important to our country
[silence]
um-hum
yeah yeah
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
[laughter] that bad huh [laughter] i wouldn't like it but i don't know if i'd go that far
[silence]
uh-huh
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah well i think pride in our country and our flag is i[s]- so important it's important in so many facets of our life
and uh i i- i feel like if they don't people don't like what our flag stands for they're welcome to go some place else e[xactly]-
there's nobody holding them here
[silence]
right they'd soon be back i'm sure
yeah
[silence]
um-hum
yeah i don't know about the judge making the decision if that's do you think that's good you know like if a jury
uh-huh
[silence]
make a recommendation do they sometimes make a recommendation that's what i was thinking they they sometimes do
[silence]
um um-hum
[silence]
and they recommend some yeah and then the judge has the final decision on what does really happen
yeah
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
well i think that's where a lot of people think boy they're getting put away for a long time but actually their chance course when a lot of times when they come up for a parole they're denied it depends on you know what they're what they'd been guilty of and
and a lot of different things i guess
[silence]
um-hum a lot slip through the the protective whatever they have to do and and there are bad ones that do slip back out and
end up hurting somebody again
um-hum um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
um-hum i always thought there was there was wrong it seems sometimes that like somebody who is stealing a loaf of bread to feed his family
got more jail sentence than somebody maybe that killed somebody it seemed like there sometimes there's not a good the balance isn't right it doesn't make sense
[silence]
um-hum um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
yeah
[silence]
so
[silence]
yeah right so let's put up with it i guess improve it if we can if we ever get a chance so
so
well it's been nice talking to you Jack and uh i hope you have a real good day and week
[silence]
[laughter] i hope not [laughter] you too bye-bye
[noise]

[noise]
there you go
w[ell]- well Jean the subject is uh jury trials and should the jury recommend
uh sentencing
uh
now my personal opinion uh i don't know uh uh here lately it seems
well up until a few years ago i guess there there w[as]- uh there just too many liberals about and permitting too many
oh they just broaden the the human rights in to to cover just about e[verybody]- everybody and i don't think uh
those guilty of committing capital crimes should be uh permitted to go spend a few years in jail and be turned loose on parole it's just not right
[silence]
and therefore i think juries should be able to recommend sentencing
[silence]
uh yes very possibly so many of us have l[ed]- led sheltered lives that uh when we go into a sit in on a a a jury i've never done it myself unfortunately i wish i could have
i've just never been called up
[silence]
well now that's possible
but uh i was called up as an an alternate once but i never made it to the jury 
[silence]
not that i know of
[silence]
uh-huh
uh i've never heard of it
[silence]
[noise] uh well there again uh
[silence]
i suppose it should be
[silence]
e[xactly]- exactly
is it guilt or innocence but then again so many times uh you get one or two holdouts and and it permits the criminals to get a retrial
[silence]
and now tha[t]- that's not too bad in this sense because you might get someone in their that's a victim of circumstances i mean that's happened
[silence]
and uh giving them ano[ther]- a[nother]- another trial might give them additional time to uh prove their innocence
yes uh we can't overlook the fact that there are innocent people that do get involved in jury trials
[silence]
hum
um-hum
[silence]
oh that's it and you just might resemble somebody
uh
out here in Texas we had a a a a
great miscarriage of justice here it was finally after nine years it was finally uh
uh uh taken care of we had a a a black man was accused simply because he resembled uh someone who stuck who who held up a uh a a 7-Eleven i think it was 
[silence]
and even though he had witnesses that said that uh he was at work and he had all sorts of of a uh character witnesses and whatnot
th[ey]-
they found him guilty
[silence]
well they said it w[as]- that this happened during lunch time and he could have disapp[eared]- uh gotten away at lunch time and uh committed the robbery 
but after nine years well as a matter of fact they made a TV show about it after nine years they finally uh came up with evidence and prove[d]- to prove that he was innocent 
[silence]
exactly now that just was not fair
so
[silence]
yes unfortunately that's what happens
[silence]
well it's not the uh uh i[t's]- i[t's]- it's not the best system but it's the best one in the world
[silence]
uh-huh
and unfortunately we just have to put up with a lot of things and they they trying to solve them_1 and everything and but uh oh i don't know i think the Supreme Court
well i'm i'm i'm still rankled about their decision to permit burning of the flag 
[silence]
well it the the uh the first amendment definitely says freedom of speech not freedom of action
and uh uh oh that just rankles me no i swear if i ever saw somebody that 
uh b[urning]- burning a flag i'd i'd try to kill them_1 i would
[silence]
well i happen to be a flag freak i served i was in the service i was in Korea
and uh
[silence]
well i saw what the red in the flag represents
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
yeah see what they
[silence]
see wh[at]- how they like it under another flag
[silence]
um-hum
well Jean we seem to be of of uh uh
the same uh uh opinions here i hope they get something out of this
[silence]
oh passing sentence well uh uh ye[s]-
yes but i i think the jury should be able to recommend
yes
[silence]
oh yes yes
[silence]
uh i don't know if that's a regular procedure or what
[silence]
but uh i know i'm always hearing that uh well the jury came in with a g[uilty]- guilty verdict and they recommended uh twenty years or something 
[silence]
yes
[silence]
of course uh now the jury may not be completely aware of all the ramifications of a sentence uh they may not know that if you give him twenty years he can get out in five
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
yeah but too many times they they are per[mitted]- permitted to go out on parole and
[silence]
yes they just go out and repeat their crimes
well there well they say a[fter]- after three offenses why it's automatically life in prison but i think they ought to make it two offenses
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
uh yeah very true well here again now there is where race seems to rear its ugly head s[o]- so frequently
uh race or nationality even
[silence]
but uh like you said it's uh i[t's]- i[t's]- it's not the best system but it's the best one we've got
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
sure enough
Jean it's been awful nice talking to you
[silence]
well let's hope neither one of us ever have to run into th[is]- this uh with subject we've been discussing take care now bye
[noise]

are you a TIer 
oh good
yeah uh she had a hard time getting a few folks uh i thought well every all these TIers have gone home uh at one o'clock on Friday 
[laughter] 
[silence]
i i i do it a lot i have i kind of worked my way through college as a mechanic as a kid
uh
so and my father and brother were in it and and my brother's still in it and i had periods when i didn't do anything but in the last ten years i've 
uh my car doesn't go to a shop you know it it i just do it all do i uh there's hardly anything that other than putting tires on that i'll do i did take it to a transmission place to put in a new transmission but i change the oil and transmission and 
uh uh i just essentially do it all i don't know uh
uh if there's anything specific in fact i could advise people uh i happen to be a M E besides but i do it for fun really and to save money and i guess that's diversion uh 
i i've i've tried a few groups uh you know where you i can recommend it for people to take their cars Like i think Sears is probably the best place because i've heard when i used to go there
and when i i just overheard what they did for me very little because i didn't take it that much but what i heard them tell other people was always right
you know when i sat there i you know i dropped my car off for tires or something like that
and so i respect they seem to actually have mechanics there
i was pretty impressed with Western Auto
but they didn't do a great job of changing my transmission uh oil last time and when when i did it the next time i realized the filter was loose and everything and i didn't like it So i'm just doing it all myself i i 
[silence]
you had to do it yeah right 
[silence]
oh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
yeah
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
oh yeah
well you like Fords apparently huh
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
really
my goodness
[silence]
yeah i wonder always wonder when you have little things like that happen why even here at TI why we don't inspect i'm in facilities why we don't inspect areas and and guarantee it so to speak uh 
we always fix things and [vocalized-noise] put things in and walk away we there needs to be a time of inspection and check out and and some thing like that with a car there ought to be someone there 
that inspects it before it's turned there ought to be an insp[ector]- inspector or quality insurance guy after after an oil change you know just in case uh they didn't put the oil in or whatever i i always wonder about that when when someone does repairs or little things like that uh 
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
no no i don't either i don't either yeah
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
you need to really uh i i do uh a lot of the simple things i i think i do most of the things better than the average person you you have Fords and i i uh i have three Chevys which
i worked my way into having the same engine i don't know how long i'm i like a V8 and i'm i'm s[old]- sold on small block Chevy V8s and i i bought one car new and i almost accidentally 
got the next car although i was kind of looking for it when i got a u[sed]- a used car with the same engine 
well then the nex[t]- the truck i got next i definitely looked for the same engine so i buy filters you know three or four at a time and essentially the engines are different you the cars are different years but the same Chevy V8 
and the part the carburetors is the same almost everything is the same the the course is two are eighties and one eighty six you know so you can learn a lot that way i there's no way i could i could fix every car in the world you know 
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
right
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah
i think they're all bad really they're 
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
is that right
[silence]
yeah
what did they want to charge you for it
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
this is your little water uh heater in there for the uh the heat inside
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
did you get it inside or outside i i took one off my little Buick i had and i pretty much took it loose on the inside but it came out from the you know underneath the hood it came from yeah 
[silence]
maybe you're right maybe you're right i it's been a long time since i took one out
[silence]
course
i broke mine you know so i'm always very careful when i change hoses on it i don't know whether you did yours
not to really pull on those i when i take those hoses i cut them off 
very gingerly because if you you know pull on that and i've always done that as a kid you know just yanked on it and they must have been stronger and heavier copper at the time 
but i broke one on my on my Buick and i always remembered it was my own fault and i thought well i'm going to to going to carefully take those hoses off 
[silence]
oh really yeah 
[silence]
It it spread out yeah
[silence]
yeah
yeah
[silence]
yeah
sometimes if you're a tinkerer you luck out My wife's
uh Chevy uh it was a Caprice air conditioning stopped i i just heard it i realized that the air conditioning wasn't cutting in
and i went out there for five minutes and i just pushed on the wires And sure enough just pure dumb luck that the connection over by it's not the evaporator the big filter on one side
i just pushed that in and i heard it click
and so sometimes you have dumb luck i i was you know you could have taken something like that and thought well the compressor's not working or it would have taken me all day probably if i didn't do that but sometimes you have some dumb luck If you have a little curiosity 
and you have enough knowledge to check things out i know i feel bad for people who just when anything goes wrong a fuse you know they just have to take it And i know that's tough if you don't uh at least give it a shot i've got girls daughters and
i've always said i'd teach them And my my one daughter was fairly interested And i really haven't gotten around to i learned because i i just uh learned you know and i feel bad about not at least showing them some of the things And i'm going to do that i i told my daughters in college this year
i said This summer we're definitely going to spend a little more time on the car i said
so you can learn the basics you know 
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
right
[silence]
i have the there's one expression i don't like uh
the country expression you know if it ain't if it ain't broke don't fix it

[silence]
uh yeah i am yeah yeah i've been uh
[silence]
i uh it is Friday yeah that's for sure well uh i guess i'm trying to think the last thing i did to a car
[silence]
oh wow okay
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
sure
[silence]
uh-huh
right right
[silence]
yeah yeah
[silence]
right
[silence]
right
[silence]
[laughter-yeah] yeah
[silence]
really
[silence]
yeah that's that's the aggravating thing yeah i i try to do as much as i can i uh i grew up on farm so i've got that uh you know take care of yourself attitude and uh oh i've done
i've done various things i've got an i've got an eighty three T Bird and i've i've changed out uh heater core and uh oh timing belts and things like that um
um i guess the last thing i took
to anybody to have done was on my wife's car um when we went in for inspection it didn't it didn't quite pass so we had to have uh that's uh that's a Mustang with a two barrel carburetor on it
they had to do some adjustments on that and of course it had never been adjusted so they had to pull it off and pull all the plugs out to get to it and uh
yeah yeah i've uh i'm kind of stuck on them right now i guess but [laughter] you know that's it's partially because i can work on them that's uh that's that's that's a big part of my decision but uh yeah we ran into some problems with uh
having them to work on that carburetor i mean they get they got everything tuned up right you know but they we got i got it home and uh
and they had left the uh oil f[ilter]- uh cap off and it was rubbing on a belt and it rubbed a notch in that li[ttle]- little things like that that really start to aggravate you that that's a lot of the reason i do my own stuff
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
sure
[silence]
sure that's right
[silence]
sure yeah [vocalized-noise]
[silence]
any anything that gets that that's in uh
gets to be an an assembly line type operation you're you're always risking that if there's too many people that get their hands on one little project you know that things they're you get y[ou]- you miss that overlap sometimes and and they miss things yeah i've i've had a hard time
finding anybody i can trust like like you say it
my old transmissions things like that i'm obviously i'm not going to i'm not going to tear apart a
automatic transmission try rebuild it
but uh it it's it's real stressful to try to find anybody that i think's going to do me right and and uh you know have an idea of what's going on
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
okay
[silence]
yeah
oh yeah
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
sure sure
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
well yeah that that the biggest you know that's the three biggest things to me you know i- i number one you've got to have the tools around if you don't have the the special tools or
well any more the the testers that you know [laughter] i i don't have a forty thousand dollar diagnostic tester sitting in my garage you know so obviously if it starts
my car start missing or something like that th[at]- it's almost impossible to track that down any more without a diagnostics but at the tools and the space to do it that that can be a big problem if it's if it's under carriage or something like that but
then it's experience you know you can you can look through a a Chilton's book or something like and get an idea of how to go about it but
you better figure on multiplying that time out about by at least by five or so
ju[st]- just just by not knowing you know how to get to that that one bolt or that one screw or whatever to get things apart
that was that was the biggest thing when i did uh the heater core in my T Bird
that is got to be the worst location for it and and the only reason i did it i [vocalized-noise]
yeah yeah the the only ones i've ever heard good good things about are are the old Lincolns and Cadillacs where they had the little door underneath the hood You just open the door and pop it out yeah but but uh
i- i had i had taken this in to have it done originally and uh
oh it it was it was tremend[ous]- well it was about seven hours labor so it it was going to run about four hundred dollars or so
and they looked it over and they they
they thought they could patch it up a little bit you know and what not so they
[silence]
yeah ye[ah]- yeah and it was it was leaking inside the car in the condenser unit so uh they they did a little patch on it
and it l[ast]- it held for about four to six months and i finally went back in and started looking at it myself and i[t]- it's a matter of tearing all the dash out and all that kind of stuff but hey it was not
uh it was not a seven hour labor job for me it was about a week before i finally through
[silence]
yeah oh really no this this was the only thing that sticks in inside the engine compartment on this are the two uh hose fittings
[silence]
yeah it it's i i've never heard a good story about uh
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
right
[silence]
okay
yeah
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
sure
[silence]
you bet well that that's what ended up being the real problem on this was the uh it the the pipe wasn't busted
but the it wasn't soldered in good enough and it had it had broken loose enough to where
if it got hot
and and n[ot]- just normal driving didn't do it but if if if it was an especially hot day the pressure would get high enough and it would start blowing the water out inside 
it was real aggravating but uh i i couldn't
eve[n]- even a week's a week's time is is worth a whole lot less than four than four hundred dollars to me you know than to have somebody else do it
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
right
that's true
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
well yeah an[d]- and and not only from a from an economic standpoint just just pure safety you know if you can if she can get yourself out of a bad situation
without having to to go to a phone booth and stand around and wait it it it can it can save a lot of time and trouble
[silence]

about how many calls have you made on this system 
[silence]
oh okay yeah
[silence]
i uh i only started doing it after uh i started getting calls and said oh heck that's right i'm supposed to make a few calls so i started
about month ago and i this is getting close to twenty here which i think is about all
uh our little gift book goes up to but i don't really know
i've got about twelve tickets in the mail do you have you've [vocalized-noise] a few
[silence]
okay uh medical go ahead i'm i'm medical that's mine 
[silence]
yeah i i'm benefits go ahead you first
[silence]
um-hum 
[silence]
oh yeah
[silence]
the one it's kind of like uh automobile insurance the ones uh that i think are the highest and important to me 
uh i hope i never have to use them really per se although i've used medical a little bit uh
that well that one certainly is high i i worry that it's weakening rather than strengthening so i like to reverse that trend and say i'd like to get those to strengthen you know be better and better
then sal[ary]- sal[ary]- salary continuance i've never used that one i hope i never will but that's kind of like an insurance thing i sure like that one
[silence]
that's like automobile insurance you never want to get in an accident but it you like to have it there
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
right
with TI or somebody else
uh-huh
[silence]
oh right yeah
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
right
[silence]
and outside consultants didn't they have an outside consultant too
did they have an outside consultant like a
the employ[ee]-
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
right
[silence]
oh really
[silence]
yeah they seem to be do[ing]- doing a good job of that i'm in facilities an[d]- and our organization built builds those facilities over in Park Central now
and i guess they've been using them for six months now and i've known several engineers that got laid off and they said
it's like getting a PhD almost they the much they learn over there you know after they've been laid off uh one engineer said it was really an education he he just learned like you he said
he learned a tremendous amount that he never would have able to pick up on his own he was very thankful for that too
[silence]
to have an office yeah
[silence]
yeah well he said he learned so much and how he thought he thought he had a PhD in how to get a job after he was through the whole process for for several months he did eventually get a job
[silence]
yeah apparently it's very sophisticated and i guess it may be one of the best uh that anyone's doing
[silence]
right you're absolutely right that's a good one
what do you think about pensions anything on that or
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
right
[silence]
what do you think of a pension that goes from one company to the other like an account like a 401[K]- account i i've been thinking about that for years uh
i know that's what i'm saying that that pensions you see just like you were you're saying you've only got uh so many years say you work for two three companies if you take your pension with you after you're vested
and then just add the money together like you do with a 401[K]- account you know
uh it's your account period it doesn't matter where you go or anything that's your account to roll over
[silence]
no no there isn't i i'm saying that's the question what do you think could be better and i'm saying that pensions say in the year two thousand or more when social security goes away which it probably will
i think they ought to have a pension at least that you'd never lose you work for a company seven years
[silence]
uh well social security's going to go to way i think and you can or you can invest your own money you have no control over your social security and it's not paid for by the current
like when say we retire after the year two thousand
social security's paid for by the twenty five year olds you know they may rebel
and you won't have any social security where if your money was in your account i mean you can never lose it it's there you don't have to depend on anybody to be putting that money in for you you know
that's just a thought i mean i
if they say which
yeah
[silence]
yeah and instead of having a a socialized pension it just would be really money that you and your company maybe you had to put some money in it too i don't really know
but i i can see where they'd need to do something on that because
the statistics are you don't work for a company twenty years through no fault of your own you know
you work for five six seven and y[ou]- y[ou]- a lot of people i know guys
[silence]
yeah i have too but not not quite that often but uh yeah i've only got uh
i've got fourteen now here at TI and i hope to make twenty five but say if something happened to me i mean
you know they lay me off uh you have a pension but then you'd have to try to get a pension in another one it would be nice if they could get them together
i do worry about medical though again knock wood that uh
i haven't used it i guess you i'm sorry you really do use it throughout the year because you get your teeth fixed and all that i mean i but i'm not i'm talking about major items i haven't used it for anything major
i'm glad it's there though
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
i have the regular i again i ju[st]- i haven't i can't complain about it because i haven't used it and every time i needed it it it [vocalized-noise] it's uh you know
fallen right in line for the the minor things i guess i'm the one just supporting most of the others
[silence]
uh yeah yeah i think it's two seventy five for a family but the dental is right away if you exams uh
okay yeah the medical you have to have a deductible
[silence]
yeah right
[silence]
well drugs are okay now i'm on that uh
plan where i take blood pressure medicine if you take an allergy medicine so anything you need a prescription for for more than six months you get it for used to be six bucks they just raised it to twelve
[silence]
yeah that's a typical that's a typical one that's in there
the forms are right in personnel
fact you may be able to take care of take advantage of that it's through Baxter Labs
[silence]
uh
[silence]
well maybe you still can do that do you do you buy your pills one at a time
[silence]
well turn turn in your forms go right to personnel i don't know whether you have to about an HMO i don't think so
you turn you get your doctor to give you a more than six months prescription
and uh they're twelve dollars again they just were six they just raised them to twelve this year
twelve dollars for a three months supply
or whatever whatever the the amount is uh i don't want to say three months but
it's a lot cheaper allergy medicine's really uh expensive and that blood pressure medicine is fairly expensive i take two
[silence]
go right to personnel they got the forms in personnel and maybe i maybe i've told you go something you didn't know about in benefits [laughter-there]
i do it yeah i you know it's a very common thing
it's through Baxter Labs tell yeah
yeah
what else i'm sure we're getting close to our five minutes whatever here
[silence]
what other benefits
[silence]
yeah the salary continuation i think that's a great one but again a hope i never use that one that means you're really sick if you have to use that one
[silence]
i'm satisfied with the vacation i don't know what else you know you nice to say you get another week
and when i'm well i only got fourteen years so i'll get another week when i hit fifteen 
[silence]
so that's that's fair i mean it's reasonable if four weeks is a lot i think 
i know some people who have twenty five years and thirty and they want more but uh you know 
uh
[silence]
um-hum 
[silence]
well the way things go i think i'm going to have to work till i'm seventy five whether i quit and uh uh or when i retire get a part-time job 

[silence]
uh i've originated only a a few 
[silence]
but i've received quite a few
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
oh yeah
[silence]
yeah i've been getting mine
[silence]
uh you pushed the record button we're supposed to be discussing the subject 
[silence]
yeah uh well i'll tell you i've
been around for quite a few years and worked for a lot of different companies and uh it's hard to beat any of the benefits that or salaries either 
that we get from TI i'm quite pleased with it 
course there's a few things that uh i think i could do better if i was sitting up in the CEO's seat but um 
[silence]
i think Jerry's doing a pretty good job as it goes
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence] 
[noise]
[silence]
well they 
[silence]
ah yes 
[silence]
um-hum 
well uh 
like i say i worked for several different companies and there's nothing to compare with uh TI here 
now i really got caught up back in eighty five i got caught up in the oil layoff 
uh i wasn't with GSI but i was connected with uh 
uh oil
uh exploration
[silence]
no with TI 
but i say i wasn't connected with GSI 
[silence]
and i got caught up in a layoff now
uh course you get six months 
uh unemployment from the state 
[silence]
but what TI did for us is is uh i i've never heard of it before 
they fixed us up with an office with uh telephones access to long distance 
uh computers
a secretary to take messages for us or type uh letters for us 
uh they had out of town newspapers
and then the co[mpany]- 
[silence]
i beg your pardon
[silence]
uh yes they they did have uh seminars every once in a while 
uh cause that was not uh restricted just to just us 
but the most important thing was that uh they had 
made up the difference between
uh unemployment pay and seventy five percent of my net pay 
and they then TI paid me that 
so uh i was able to uh not just exist i mean i i lived just as comfortably as i did before i was laid off 
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
well this was not a learning thing by any means it was just a uh 
uh an assistance trying to find another job 
[silence]
oh uh-huh
[silence]
well course i went through this uh what about five years ago they may have improved it considerably 
[silence]
well that's one of those little uh 
uh little extras that you don't see in the uh the the the handbook you know 
[silence]
it
[silence]
well now i have uh uh i'm getting close to retirement
and of course i've been looking into it but uh 
since i'm only a yellow badger i won't be getting a whole heck of a lot from TI as far as retirement is concerned 
[silence]
i've never heard of such a thing
[silence]
um-hum 
[silence]
uh yeah
[silence]
i that that sounds like a hell of an idea i didn't know there was such a thing 
[silence]
yes by all means well what would be the difference between that and social security 
[silence]
yeah yeah 
[silence]
uh-huh no i i like the idea course that's that's some something like an IRA 
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah that that's what i've done i i've bounced around about every ten years i change 
[silence]
um-hum 
[silence]
uh-huh
well knock wood i haven't used mine any[thing]- for anything major just doctor visits and 
well i i have the uh the Homa i use Homa 
and i like that uh a lot better than Aetna
[silence]
uh-huh 
[silence]
well doesn't it work you don't see uh uh anything until you spend the minimum
don't you have to spend the minimum of two three hundred 
[silence]
yeah well now i have the same dental you have 
[silence]
uh-huh now see i don't have a deductible
i pay a straight five dollars for anything a doctor visit or drugs 
[silence]
oh that one i haven't heard about
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah i have high blood pressure problems myself
[silence]
eve[ry]- thirty days at a time 
[silence]
hum 
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
um
yeah [vocalized-noise] 
[silence]
yeah i just might do that 
[silence]
well thanks thanks for the tip Jim i i shall look into it 
[silence]
yeah [laughter] 
uh let's see we discussed uh uh medical and dental 
uh retirement 
[silence]
uh-huh
what about vacation
[silence]
uh
[silence]
uh yeah that's right
[silence]
um-hum 
well i'm uh i'm here i've got just eleven years 
and i don't think i'll ever see a a silver badge i won't i won't be around that long 
[silence] 

[noise]
okay
[silence]
[noise]
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
um i believe in it too [laughter]
uh i'm Catholic and we're not supposed to but uh i feel that it like you you know on the premeditated murders i feel if you're you know i mean if it's beyond a doubt that you did it
you know i would say go ahead and execute that person as well
but it's the cases you know like sometimes you you know you hear of people that they say they went to jail falsely you know they really didn't do it well you know
you you got you got that point well h[ow]- you know what what if a mistake is made and you put someone
you know to death that really didn't do it
[silence]
there's always that chance i don't know but
i would say that you know for that many people to all of them agree that you did it and it was premeditated it would be kind of hard for you know
you know what i'm saying like
[silence]
yeah
so uh i
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
exactly
uh i'm not sure about Pennsylvania whether we have it or not for some reason i was thinking that we do but it's you know it's not very often i think maybe last year was the first time in like eighteen years or something like that
that anyone
anyone from Pennsylvania had gotten it i don't do you know if Virginia has it
[silence]
uh-huh
i know Florida has it
[silence]
[laughter]
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
uh you know
[silence]
yeah but it's funny that uh i mean
like you know like i said i think last year was the first time in like eighteen years for Pennsylvania i'm not even sure of that but for some reason
i think that you know it was something like that and it surprised and even Florida i know they have it and you don't really hear about it real often how many people
[silence]
yeah but you you think that i mean if you think of how many premeditated murders are committed
you know compared to that and to how many people are being sent that doesn't seem like very many
[silence]
yeah
everyone would appeal
that's true too
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
yeah
[silence]
yeah uh-huh and then they get out
yeah they get out in three years on probation and they do it again you know
it's like a slap on the fingers for them
i don't i don't
uh i- i don't i think that it should be i mean if it's beyond a doubt that someone did premeditate someone a murder then i think you know that they should likewise you know someone should take their life also but uh
[silence]
but are are you would you draw the line there with just the premeditated murder
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
[laughter]
[silence]
i think some of them would rather be in jail [laughter]
[silence]
yeah they probably have it better in jail than what they would out in the streets
[silence]
i don't know uh i was just going to say something i forgot what it was
[silence]
oh i don't even remember what it was now
[silence]
in Clarion well i live in Butler but i'm at c[ollege]- i'm at college i'm at Clarion University
[silence]
yeah
[laughter]
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
see yeah okay well see i'm i'm in kind i'm in kind okay uh we only have
seven thousand students in the entire campus
yeah and that would be pushing it so i mean this is definitely a college town um we're about two hours north of Pittsburgh if that would help you out any um
north of Pittsburgh Pennsylvania
oh i've never heard of Polk but 
[silence]
oh i never heard of that
[silence]
it might have a new name
yeah yeah we're probably about an hour away from Sharon
uh-huh uh
[noise]
so i most of the kids here i you know like you know just from dorm mates and stuff they'll say that they don't believe in it but then after i would say my point of view then they'll say well yeah you know [vocalized-noise] you know
[silence]
yeah you know i think people can be persuaded one way or another i've never seriously ran into someone i mean like other than my priest you know who definitely says you can't take a you know you can't take anyone's life um
anyone that is like so against it that you couldn't persuade them in any instance
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
[laughter-exac[tly]-] yeah [laughter] uh-huh
[silence]
yeah but you know i look at that and say well they should have thought about that beforehand
you know
[silence]
uh-huh
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah
that's something you know [laughter-i] [laughter-mean] but uh [laughter] wh[ether]- whether they plea bargain or not if they're guilty of murder they're guilty of murder you know
so i don't think that they deserve anything less [laughter]
it's just i don't i don't know i just
[laughter]
[silence]
uh-huh and that costs money yeah
uh-huh
[silence]
[laughter]
[silence]
yeah
[silence]

[noise]
[silence]
okay
[silence]
well uh anyways i'm not exactly sure i i wasn't really uh paying attention as to what particular uh parts of capital punishment we're supposed to talk about but it was uh basically what's your views on whether you thought there was certain cases that should be used that sort of thing
right and uh
i don't know i've i've always thought that any uh crime that uh
that uh intentionally where someone goes out and premeditatively takes another life
would be the ones where i think that capital punishment would be necessary to keep that person from perhaps uh doing it again and even more so to get people on the outside who are professionals to realize that
you know there's a a very steep penalty to uh be paid
when that's done
and uh
[silence]
yeah how do you feel about it
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
right exactly
[silence]
uh-huh
right if if the [vocalized-noise] evidence wasn't overwhelming right
uh-huh
[silence]
well i think that should be likewise decided by the jury you know because
i don't know [noise] i think a jury would be less likely to just send a man to death just for any reason [noise] i don't know a judge might be a little more cold-blooded about it [noise]
[silence]
[noise] yeah i don't think we
[silence]
no huh-uh
no we don't
yeah
[silence]
uh-huh
oh yeah [laughter] they're always doing it in Florida Florida and Louisiana i think and uh some of the other southern states
[silence]
of course they have such a crime problem because they have such a un[employment]- unemployment rate [noise] you get that unemployment way up so then people you know tend towards crime and then they [noise] they start stiffening the penalties
[silence]
well in Florida seems like uh two or three times a year it's constantly on the
[noise]
yeah
[silence]
no that's true course they have a requirement that uh that every single appeal must be permitted
so of course the the attorneys take them through the whole chain
you know even if the case is open and closed they go all the way up to the Supreme Court you know
[silence]
they almost always get thrown right back out again but they have to have every single appeal made open to them
and you know it's sort of strange because it almost
[silence]
it almost seems like the attorneys are doing it for the money or something because i mean the guy knows that
whether it's
you know a a month or two or six years he's still going to get you know the chair when it comes around [laughter]
you know
some of these guys are
really uh
you know violent Son of Sam killers and stuff like that you know
i mean they everyone knows they're going get not going to get out
[silence]
yeah
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
i think so uh a lot of the the the other violent crimes i don't really feel that strongly about although you know stiffer sentences and lessening the effects of parole i mean
these guys are certainly not going to uh be they can't i mean they're getting into drugs and fights and all that stuff in prison i don't think the parole system is really helping that [laughter-much]
reduce the violence in the prisons i think that's its only purpose
is
is you know to reduce uh the violence in the prisons so people behave themselves a little bit better if they think they're going to get off early
off earlier but some of these guys just don't care you know
and so uh
[silence]
yeah right uh-huh
[silence]
um that's possible i guess
[silence]
um so where do you live in Pennsylvania
[silence]
oh okay [noise] i don't think i really know that
[silence]
because uh you know that all depends too on where you are at that's uh sort of interesting to get opinions as to where different parts of the country are because_1 the more grass root country uh parts of the country tend to
to support capital punishment where the places that are you know less in contact with crime you know the the more more urban i mean less
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
two hours where
oh okay near Polk
[silence]
Polk Institute
[silence]
it's uh an old uh university that turned into a place for the mentally retarded uh
[silence]
very old uh historical place there
Sharon Pennsylvania's up there
yeah
[silence]
oh okay
[silence]
in that case maybe you know
[silence]
right
that's true yeah well it it you know you get certain circumstances where you hear about these people that have you know stolen kids and
you know done terrible things to them and killed them and you know that sort of thing
you just like i don't want that person sharing the Earth with me you know i mean that is just terrible
and uh you know we had a case like that here and on the other hand you know people are saying that because the
he knows because the criminals know that the uh penalties can be very severe they uh there's less criminals that are you know turning themselves in or you know
pleading or whatever
because they know that the judge you know if they find them guilty is you know has the the opportunity to sentence them you know for for the death sentence
[silence]
yeah well i'm just saying that that that's what the the client lawyers are saying they're saying that you know you know more of my clients would have pleaded guilty if they would have gotten a light sentence instead of possibly having to
to to get a death sentence because you can't plea bargain what the sentence is going to be you can plea bargain what you're guilty of but
you know
but not how they're going to sentence it
[silence]
right uh-huh
[silence]
yeah right
[silence]
uh-huh i was just saying that way what they're saying is that they can't get people to turn themselves in then
and so we have to go through a trial then to prove the person's guilty and perhaps we can and perhaps we can't and so the guy might get off
[laughter] and uh
although usually the guys that are turning themselves in are are guys that are you know going to get caught anyways but
there's always a few of those people that are you know lost their head or whatever
[silence]
anyways
but uh
yeah we just had a terrible case in Virginia where some girl disappeared and and the guy like i said he just uh
said that he took her but he won't admit that she died or whatever and he won't say where the body is because he knows the penalty's very s[evere]- s[evere]- you know mandatory life sentences for murder

[noise]
so child care your views
[silence]
and what religious faith
[silence]
oh
[silence]
that's that's good
[silence]
uh they do seem to be at the outside edge of both extremes don't they
[silence]
and whenever
they are they seem to
[silence]
regulate the good toward the bad instead of bad toward the good
[silence]
better situations
[silence]
yeah yeah that's that's very well phrased uh
[silence]
so have you ever used outside child care
[silence]
real day care
[silence]
uh
[silence]
our step daughter's ten now
[silence]
and
most of the day care has been provide for by Grandma
[silence]
but
quite honestly what i believe to be
the best day care situation was while we lived up the pass of Woodland Park
[silence]
there was uh
[silence]
ex school teacher that uh
did
a small amount of before school and
and after school you know kindergartners or half-dayers
in her home
[silence]
and they would read and play
[silence]
seem to be
[silence]
uh yeah and uh
despite
our beliefs
she was uh
[silence]
one of the more um
[silence]
charismatic Christian faiths
[silence]
and it worked out wonderfully
[silence]
uh yeah but i don't know that it would be state approved
[silence]
i
now i don't know what the current Texas laws are
but i
[silence]
but i do know that the license doesn't seem to
[silence]
guarantee quality
[silence]
uh
now here i believe that
child care
[silence]
meets by in large certain standards for
[silence]
uh
balanced food if they provide food
cleanliness
[silence]
and
[silence]
levels of supervision
[silence]
levels being defined as
number of of working adults for
number of
children
[silence]
but
[silence]
yeah uh
my wife is uh agnostic
and i'm a
backsliding Presbyterian
[silence]
and uh
[silence]
yet
i really believe that this
charismatic
[silence]
care
[silence]
or the charismatic belief when emphasized on care
[silence]
or semi charismatic i might say
[silence]
was quite good
[silence]
yes very
[silence]
and and
[silence]
uh
[silence]
the care is what i guess you should emphasize in the term child care instead of the child
[silence]
and not have any care
[silence]
and i'm not sure that really
[silence]
child care per se should instill
any
[silence]
education per se
you know what i'm saying
[silence]
proper interface
[silence]
it's just just correctness of of
[silence]
social skills if you will
[silence]
uh yeah uh
[silence]
it's a very broad issue
[silence]
and
[silence]
you know it's a shame but most people doing child care
earn almost no money
[silence]
they operate at you know um
the owner of the chi[ld]- of a you know a large child care facility now we're not talking somebody that does six kids in their home or or three or or whatever
[silence]
right
their employees earn almost nothing
[silence]
and and that's really a a shame too because
[silence]
do you and your husband both work
[silence]
well that's wonderful if if you can make it that way
[silence]
well like i said
[silence]
that's
grand if if you can pull it off
[silence]
but
[silence]
more and more
we're being forced into a situation we as Americans are being forced into a situation
[silence]
where
[silence]
you've got to have [vocalized-noise]

[silence]
uh well we only have one child right now and another one on the way and right now i'm i'm home with her during the day
i if i was looking for outside care i probably would stay away from professional child care centers
and try to find if i was close to home relatives or people with the same values and possibly religious faith or something similar so that she would be raised in an environment that would be
similar to what we would have in our own homes as as parents
[silence]
uh Latter Day Saints
[silence]
so
[silence]
that's what i would try to do
with a teaching background i've um had a little bit of experience with the child day care type situations but i've seen some good ones and i've seen some really bad ones
[silence]
uh-huh and everything in between yeah in most states there's nothing to regulate them
and so
[silence]
right by trying to get them to conform to concern standards they uh kind of uh eliminate a lot of the
uh
[silence]
yeah the the uh what am i trying to think of tha[t]-
[silence]
not the imagination but the creativity in in the situation and so
[silence]
[laughter]
[silence]
no i haven't we've had like people come in and babysit for an hour or two but i've never had um
right she's she's not even a year yet so
we haven't been in you know a lot of need yet
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah i like that situation that's usually real good [laughter]
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
have a relative struct[ured]- a structured
activities and not just you know stick them in a corner and say you're on your own
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah i know that um that
i guess if you have the opportunity to pick and choose and you've got the time and that uh
i don't know if the resources are the proper term you know just the the know knowledge of who's a available then you could probably find some really good care
[silence]
that's true you can get somebody somebody willing to babysit but actual
you know that's sometimes different on a done on a different scale
i have even considered you know babysitting myself i have a teaching degree and uh
thought well you know i could structure and then for one reason or other decided not to
but i think if you take more than three children in well that was how it was this Virginia we've recently moved here to Texas
but in Virginia i think if you take more than three children in on more than a several hours a day bases you have to be licensed
[silence]
yeah a lot of times you might just need to go now and feel file for it just like a business you may not have to prove any type of qualification for it i don't
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
that's uh kind of a minimum there that you're getting your covering basic care there and not
all the extras that most people would like to see
done with there children you know like the educational activities the supervised play and
so forth
[silence]
i like that [laughter-term]
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah it was a good influence for your daughter uh
well that's good
[silence]
uh-huh
yeah a little bit of love and and attention is what most of them need
[silence]
you know even if it's
not a real educated program you can have good educational program and and
[silence]
right and and that's not certainly what you want for your child or what you would give your child yourself
so
[silence]
well even educated play uh supervised play can teach without and i'm not saying talking about sitting down and teaching them math or or or something like that but just kind of promoting social skills and uh
you know like my my child that she want be an only child for long but you know she was an only child or maybe your daughter not having yeah
yeah just
[silence]
uh-huh right those basic things that uh they would
[silence]
that you know maybe a little bit of uh
i don't know if manners is a is a good term or not but you know dealing with other through uh
proper mannerisms and politeness and so forth you know that sort of thing you'd want your child to learn that
from been experience with i mean someone else certainly you wouldn't want your child's day care person to yell at them and scream at them and say do this do that you know you'd want them to
promote politeness and niceness you know the things that you would want any child to learn
and -[u]sually that's done through example not an actual sit down learn situation so
[silence]
uh-huh it is [laughter]
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
who really doesn't really put a lot of overhead whatever into it you mean somebody that has an actual establishment
yeah
[silence]
yeah
i know i i did that for summer so i can i can vouch for [laughter-that]
[silence]
no just he does i'm i'm here during the day with her
[silence]
well we we decided to live with a uh uh lesser budget so that we have that that's more important to us
you know [vocalized-noise] as as uh
there may come a time when i will be working again you know but right now that's what we've chosen and we wanted to have several we got her and we've got another on the way and
may have another one soon after that so [laughter]
[silence]
right
[silence]

[noise]
we're supposed to talk about the Middle East crisis and should we be involved and uh what's it going to cost us in the long run 
[silence]
are you ready
[silence]
[noise]
the Middle East crisis should we be there 
[silence]
well you realize why we were
[silence]
in the Middle East why we invaded Iraq why we were in Saudi why we attacked Kuwait and we we're why we are still fighting Iraq
[silence]
no i really believe it's because
[silence]
i think it has something to do with oil don't get me wrong
[silence]
but Saddam is Saddam is a madman
[silence]
anyone that would
use chemical weapons to fight his own people
[silence]
and
[silence]
obviously that has something to do with it
[silence]
and
and if you know i can see that
he was in Kuwait
Kuwait was the non aggressor 
[silence]
and
the Saudis are our allies
we have several treaties and several alliances
with the Saudis that range back for probably forty years
[silence]
you know they've been our friends through thick and thin
[silence]
they were at the Saudi border
[silence]
and ready to storm into Saudi
[silence]
shouldn't we try and help our friends
[silence]
what did we lose forty one Americans lives 
[silence]
oh of course our government is full of liars thieves and crooks
[silence]
and that's our own fault because we elected them
[silence]
you know
it's uh
i went on jury duty here not long back
and uh
[silence]
one of the
guys that was on the jury they were asking him if if you could believe a lawyer or if a lawyer's reputation was so tainted that he couldn't be believed
and one guy being selected
[silence]
snickered and couldn't keep his head up you know and
[silence]
the guy said well can you share it with us what you what you find so funny he says well i already told you my sons a lawyer
he said that when he graduated the day after his bar examine there in Houston
[silence]
he told him
dad you know how to tell when a lawyers lying to you his lips are moving
[silence]
and ninety percent of all politicians are lawyers
[silence]
so by definition all lawyers and politicians are liars
[silence]
the fact that they take our money
[silence]
and don't do what we think is right makes them_1 thieves
[silence]
so what's it going to cost us in the long run there in Saudi
are we going to lose more lives there
[silence]
well we hit them
[silence]
with more
[silence]
in one month
[silence]
than we used in three years the last three years of Vietnam
[silence]
and whenever
[silence]
you strike on open terrain with that sheer volume
[silence]
there's
[silence]
nothing they can do about it
you know it's not like we
[silence]
threw
[silence]
eight aircraft over there all by ourselves and said this is wrong
[silence]
we were there the Brits were there the French were there this is with UN backing
[silence]
and to some level even Russia was behind us
[silence]
so
[silence]
honestly if
[silence]
there is was
[silence]
a well perceived war world wide this was it
[silence]
but
what i can't understand is
then many of the Kuwaiti youth
[silence]
didn't fight wouldn't fight
[silence]
it's okay for us to go expend our
[silence]
youth's
[silence]
lives like so much water in the desert
[silence]
and it's not their job to fight for their own land
[silence]
and really from all i can indica[te]- from all indications the Iraqi
[silence]
beliefs if you will
[silence]
are more similar to our own
[laughter]
and
[silence]
the Kuwaitis aren't even helping rebuild their own country
the Kuwaiti
young
[silence]
won't rebuild anything they won't work
[silence]
yeah it was on the news last night
[silence]
the uh [noise]
US Army is doing it all
[silence]
well they talked to uh one Kuwaiti woman yesterday
[silence]
and her biggest concern in life was
[silence]
that she couldn't get a housekeeper
[silence]
and do you have a housekeeper
[silence]
well i wouldn't mind having one
[silence]
but you know i'd like to uh make sure that i have a job tomorrow first
[laughter]
it it astound you realize that the Kuwaiti government gives every Kuwaiti man woman and child money
[silence]
for nothing
[silence]
for noth[ing]- f[or]- for for doing nothing for sitting on there keisters 
ooh that ought to give their programming trouble shouldn't it
uh
[silence]
they do nothing they hand them money each year and they're part of

[noise]
[silence]
okay
[silence]
[noise] okay
[silence]
i guess so
[silence]
oh dear that's a hard one that's really hard for me because
uh you know i really i have a son that's sixteen and i think you know eventually you know he'll be of of drafting age and i think gosh do i want him to go and yet i'm proud to be an American and i know that we have a
a country that you know people would give anything to live in a lot of people anyway because we have so many wonderful things that they don't have and yet i don't know whether i'd be willing to give his life for for this country and yet
[silence]
and yet i know that i that and i- i when i was in school it was always the tired the tired excuse that we went to war to save us against communism
but i'm not sure th[at]- that that's the reason anymore 
i mean not sure that communism is is as strong as it once was and i'm not sure that that that's the reason why we're like we were in Vietnam supposedly so
[silence]
well with the [vocalized-noise]
[silence]
well it's because of oil isn't it
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
oh yes i agree with that
[silence]
oh yeah well yeah he's uh a bad person very definitely
yeah
[silence]
oh sure sure
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
yeah many years
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
well
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
certainly but what at at what cost you know that's the uh the thing it came out it came out wonderfully supposedly i mean everything is and we won
yeah and that that's wonderful but what if if that wasn't the case what if we would have lost thousands of young men would that would it have been too much of a price to pay for that i don't know see and i think there are a lot of things that we don't know but
the American people
[silence]
oh sure well and there's a lot that we
[silence]
yeah i think that's true but i think there's a lot that we the public doesn't need to know i think there's some things we shouldn't know just for national national security sake
and i you know i think if we did know i think there would be a lot more chaos than there is because i don't i don't think people could handle it so i think there are things that we should not know the masses shouldn't know but i also agree that there are a lot of crooks and liars too
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
um-hum
[silence]
oh my [laughter-gosh] [laughter] oh
[silence]
oh i have a lawyer background yeah have a law background you're right
[silence]
yeah that's true [noise] yeah that's true
[silence]
see and i don't know i don't know i can't tell the future that's what scares me so much about it i mean i thought the war was going to go on and on i really was surprised when it ended so quickly and
[silence]
i know yeah
[silence]
um-hum um-hum
[silence]
right
[silence]
um-hum um-hum
[silence]
um right
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum right they were
[silence]
oh sure sure
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
yeah yeah
[silence]
yeah that is very [laughter] it's very strange uh and yet you know see that's another thing that that's difficult for Americans their culture is so much different than ours that
[vocalized-noise] you know i've heard from many people that we could not even begi[n]- begin to understand how they feel about things because their values and their perceptions are so much different than ours
and um they just don't think the same way we do their culture is completely different and almost opposite
[silence]
um-hum
yeah that's true
[silence]
huh i didn't realize that
[silence]
oh my word
[silence]
hum yeah [noise] see and that's another question you have to ask is this our job is are we should we still be there even you know
i don't know the answers to that those questions i think they're tough and i think you know it's i don't know that anybody knows the answers i think they know what they believe but i'm not sure they really are one hundred percent sure
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
you're kidding that's unreal
[silence]
no [laughter]
no and don't plan on having one either ever so
[silence]
oh i'd love to have one but you know
[silence]
sure sure that's right that's right
[silence]
uh no i wasn't i didn't wasn't aware of that no
for doing nothing yeah
[silence]
um-hum um-hum
[silence]
[laughter]
[silence]

[noise]
okay um i don't have any i guess definite views about elderly care um
the first thing that comes to mind is kind of those horror movies that you see where elderly people are abused and things like that i think that's one thing that i would look at if i was
putting my grandmother or my mother uh
in some sort of home the first thing that i would look at would be their history
as far as any court cases that came out of there um the history of you know their doctors um their nurses and things like that
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
i'm just out of curiosity what what kinds of things were they doing when they were considered a bad place
[silence]
huh uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh
[silence]
oh my goodness
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
in pain or something yeah
[silence]
huh
[silence]
yeah that's what i was going to say it sounds like to just neglect all over neglect you know to clean up and 
[silence]
right right
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
that's great
[silence]
homely yeah
[silence]
i would i would personally hate to know that my mother or grandmother or
anyone is in a home like that and my biggest fear would that they would be is that they would be lonely
and i would like to know that there are
you know just a lot of activities like you said you know just putting a plant in a room you know Just makes just brightens and and and just makes them just a little more active television
they can go outside and just to know that they're not you know laying in a room looking at gray walls you know that that would
that that's what would just really kill me i'd like to know that you know they have friends there and they you know have little conversations and things i'd like to know there's a lot of interaction and
maybe some kind of of activity little field trips or something i don't know how they would do that but
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
wow
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh i didn't realize that there were groups that go in like that that's really neat that's really neat 
[silence]
right uh-huh
[silence]
oh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
that is great for that that will be something you know they would look forward to if they knew you know that the puppy is coming on Wednesday
you know that would be something to look for that's really neat that really is
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
right
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
putting putting any of my family in an elderly 
home to me would be the very last resort you know it
um and i know it's hard for a lot of families if you're trying to to work or trying to take care of your own family it's kind of hard to
to to because an elderly person sometimes can be
totally dependent you know on you and i know that's hard sometimes and but it would really have to be a last resort because that would just i would feel so guilty
just i don't know unless i knew that they were somewhere just really
i mean just really great you know that they were really enjoying
[silence]
i don't know anyone personally that's in an elderly home
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah yeah
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
to nod their head and smile at them
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
um
[silence]
um
[silence]
right
[silence]
oh
[silence]
oh
[silence]
that's something that i mean if i had to work
in an elderly home i don't think i could do it
like i i would really like to be a teacher
but i don't think i could do it because i'm very very emotional
and the minute i mean the minute something happens i mean i cry on i mean you know Hallmark commercials but i'm just that's just the end of me
and so i mean something real life i just i'm
i uh interview a lot of children i'm an education reporter
and i always go you know everyday i'm doing an education things and
i meet these kids who are you know dropping out of school left and right and all the sudden they're in this program they're making straight A's they're going to graduate early
and i'm just i just want to hug them and go you are just fantastic and you know i could just imagine you know working in a home like that
and those people they're so sweet and and so genuine
you know and all they want is just for everything to be happy and you know
and so that would probably just tear me apart i mean in a good way but you know
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
uh-huh
i'm sure
[silence]
uh-huh uh-huh
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
right yeah
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
[laughter]
and children i mean
usually a lot of elderly people like to
they like to uh share their experiences with the younger children they'll be telling them all kinds of stories that they don't even know what they mean but
you know they feel like they've lived life so they need to share it and i'm sure i'll be like that too
yeah
[silence]
but that's great i didn't know there were such groups
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah yeah
[silence]
and i would hate it if anyone put me in one women
[silence]
yeah [laughter]
[laughter]
somebody take care of me
okay thus
okay
[silence]
okay well nice to talk to you
okay uh-huh bye-bye
[silence]

[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
right
[silence]
yeah yeah i agree with you i um a group that i'm a part of goes once a month to a um they call it the Heritage House
they call it the Heritage House it's it's a nursing home for elderly people and this particular one has people that are in pretty bad shape a lot of them have had
um limbs amputated or um have serious illnesses you know that kind of thing and
um i watched the interesting thing was i watched this particular one change hands it started out just being a terrible place for the people and then a new company bought it
and came in and remodeled the whole place hired new nurses and uh just really just redid it you know
[silence]
well to me it was dirty for one thing uh when you would walk in the smell was just awful though you know the floors you could just
if you're walking on them feel how filthy they were um there were a lot of people just kind of up and down the halls laying in their beds hollering and you know crying and
of course i don't know how many of them were you know not in their right mind or how many were
you know yeah yeah i just really don't know but i feel like they were neglected and um
[silence]
right
right
right i don't really think anyone was being you know cruel or or trying to mistreat them or anything i just think they were
just not doing anymore you know than they had to do and um just kind of letting everybody live
[laughter] in a not very good environment
but this new company came in and they like i said they remodeled the place and it smells nice when you walk in and it looks nice and
they got like several new color TV's for the people and and redid the dining room where they made it you know a lot more interesting place for them to be they made a little patio area where they can go outside and
yeah just you know small things that make it seem a lot more
yeah and it's like it's a lot more like an apartment place instead of just uh horrible
[silence]
right
[silence]
right
[silence]
right
[silence]
uh-huh uh-huh
[silence]
right
right with nothing you know
yeah
[silence]
right
[silence]
right
[silence]
um
[silence]
right
yeah
well they uh this place that we visit it's really neat they have everyday they have schedules of groups that come in and
they will do bingo our group does a church service once a month and and then other groups come in and do the services you know other Sundays so that they have at least one service every Sunday and
so there are a lot of things there are places that have a lot of things for them to do
but you really do have to kind of seek it out you know and
and make sure that it's not a place like this one was [laughter]
[silence]
yeah yeah yeah it is it's real nice and um i know our church does it and there are a lot of other churches and they are just like civic organizations that do
and uh i have other friends it's kinds of neat they take animals over and let the people pet them like they also have a dog that maybe needs a home and they will wash it all up and
make sure it's it's a friendly animal you know and take it in and let just let the old elderly people pet the dogs
yeah
[silence]
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah yeah i thought that was a real unusual thing for someone to do so
yeah there's a lot that can be done it's just a matter of people not being lazy
and you know doing the best they can again i don't know what i'd do if it was my own mother or grandmother you know uh that would be
[silence]
right yeah
[silence]
right
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah
yeah yeah i would too
[silence]
yeah right yeah
yeah i know i know what you mean
[silence]
yeah well i have interesting conversations with a lot of these people because um
um many of them of course their minds are not good
and so a lot them have told me exactly the same story you know every time i visit them
they'll tell me reminisce about childhood and tell me something that they did and then the next time i go it's the same thing you know but
just somebody to listen to them uh just seems to make them really feel good
right i'll tell you the people i feel the sorriest for there's a guy at this particular one i go to that i think that he's really an intelligent person but he has cerebral palsy so bad that he just cannot communicate
and um he's blind and he has seizures you know i mean he's just like in a world of his own and yet he wants so much to be around people
and if you come over to him if he can touch your hand he'll grab it and kiss it and oh he's always got a smile i mean he really tries to
to brighten up your life oh it's just amazing um but he can't say anything he can just kind of make noises you know
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
me too
[silence]
yeah uh-huh
i know
i know
[silence]
i know
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
um
[silence]
um
yeah yeah
[silence]
oh yeah
[silence]
uh-huh uh-huh
[silence]
yeah yeah
[silence]
oh it does yeah
yeah yeah it is it's really hard and
but one of the neatest things i think though is we always take our kids i have a three year old and a six year old and they um
have gotten comfortable being around these people because they've always gone with us
and the people love them and
they want the children you know to hug them or hold their hand and so far my kids will do it just real easily
and i think it's because they've gone since they were real little and they've never been afraid but that's something to me children
you know need to people need to take groups of children [laughter] because the kids just brighten up their lives they
as we walk through the the lobby they'll all say bring her here i want to see her [laughter] i would love to hold her
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
that's true
[silence]
yeah
yeah well me too
yeah it's quite an experience
[silence]
yeah yeah there are and and uh it really helps those people i think
but like you said i'd really have a lot of second thoughts before i put any of my own family members there
it would be a last resort
[silence]
oh i know i'm always afraid like oh no what if i lose my mind am i going to end up in a place like that [laughter]
[laughter]
yeah
yeah that's right
[silence]
well
yeah you too Tonya thanks for calling bye
[noise]

[silence]
great um currently i'm not doing a whole lot of exercise in any type of program
i'm mainly do a lot of walking um i have a son that's a little bit overweight and um the best thing we found to do with him is to walk around so my wife and i kind of take turns
um at one time i had a a fairly regular exercise program
but in the last couple of months i've changed to a a new residence
and everything has gotten kind of turned upside down all this space that uh [laughter-normally] [laughter-would] [laughter-be] [laughter-dedicated] towards the exercise area is uh covered in boxes
[silence]
well i had a a a little routine that i i did for uh warm ups and then i did some uh very
m[ild]- mild say light weight lifting
nothing and i'm not trying to make big bulging muscles just trying to try stay as firm as i can stay in my old age [laughter]
[laughter]
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
yeah that's that's that's a plus uh i have a total of five children i have three left living at home
and they do take up a big part of my uh my evening and weekend
and it's tough being a parent and trying to do all the things that you should do for yourself too [laughter]
it's uh something they don't tell you about when you're growing up
yes when you become a parent most of your life is going to be dedicated to your children
[laughter]
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
well there's you you have to
uh what i found from my experiences you have to budget time for yourself
and then uh the you you can use what ever rationale you want but basically the healthier you stay the longer you'll live
and uh you know if i spend a little bit of time each day or a little bit of time every other day doing something for me to make me live longer well then i'll be around a lot longer
those people that i'm taking the ten minutes or twenty minutes away from now well you know get the enjoyment of me years past where i would have been if i hadn't taken it
so if you kind of think of it as a rationale like that it works out fine
[silence]
um
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
oh i've done a lot of study over the years and i found that uh
probably one of the worst things that uh anybody can ingest is chlorinated water
yeah um the research i've done and uh i've actually been in the drinking watering business since eighty three and
it's it's amazing that uh you know like prior to like nineteen twenty there were n[ot]- very few heart attacks
there were none prior to nineteen hundred well in nineteen O three they started experimenting with chlorinating the water in nineteen thirteen most of the major cities had chlorinated water and after that we started having the hearts attacks
and uh Dr Price wrote a book Coronarys Cholesterol and Chlorine you can usually find it at a health food store
i know they had it in health food stores in Plano i used to live in Plano
that's
uh Dr Price yeah and it's amazing he makes the in you know it's a very small book and the guy's very opinionated
um but he makes a very good case against chlorine there were no heart attacks before we started using it and he s[ays]- points out that people in uh England and uh or eating diets
that quadrupled the amount of cholesterol that we're ingesting now
and they weren't dropping dead of heart attacks and
yeah he did some experiments on chickens whose arteries are very similar to ours
and uh proved that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis which is the clogging of the arteries and uh
you know he's uh there's been a lot of reports since then and this whole thing about you know first it was stress then they went to cholesterol and now they're saying what's cholesterol well there's good cholesterol and there's bad cholesterol and
you know it's it's it's amazing what he points out in that book and that um in fact he even uh there was a uh toxicologist for the Environmental Protection Agency
who did work back in nineteen eighty six who wrote a letter to Dr Price in nineteen eighty seven
and in this letter he praised Dr Price for the work he did back in the sixties on this
and said that the EPA had been doing experiments on non human primates and proving that injection of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis
and EPA never published that report
[silence]
uh Coronarys Cholesterol and Chlorine
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
huh
[silence]
yeah there's there's a there's a lot of good information out there
uh about health and a lot of the uh a lot of the myths they've been passing around people are
are starting to realize aren't true i mean i'm all for having a diet high in fiber and all that because_1 that's that's good for you
uh but to to believe some of the things that they you know and i don't think anybody should be going out there and eating a high high fat diet
but to think that that solely alone is going to cause something like arteriosclerosis is
it's just hard to believe
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
yeah i actually
eat pretty much anything that i want
and i've had my cholesterol checked and uh you know a few times and i've never been above uh like a hundred and fifty
never
and uh
uh i mean i
[silence]
um
[silence]
y[ou]- y[ou]-
well what they tell me but i mean you know
everything's like within uh five to ten percent and all [laughter-that] [laughter-kind] [laughter-of] [laughter-thing] [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter]
[laughter] they leave themselves wide open so they can't be sued
[laughter]
[silence]
but uh we've uh i work at the TI site in Hunt Valley Maryland
yeah and we've had a few of the health fairs up here and
you know i've always come out aces
and i'm you know i'm not really that big on on watching what i eat
i i do eat you know some health cookies that are high in fiber and
low in fat and all that kind of stuff but i mean as far as being really concerned about
ingesting too much uh chlorine i'm not or cholesterol i'm not worried about

[silence]
okay
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
um what did you do when you e[xercised]- when you did exercise regularly
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
[laughter-yeah]
um
[silence]
well right now um
i try to when it's nice out it's been raining a lot this spring but i try to i have a bicycle and i like to cycle a lot
and uh my husband and i we have entered a few rallies that's pretty popular in Texas i don't know if it's up north but
like every weekend a small town will sponsor a rally and uh thousands of people come with their bikes and ride over hilly terrain for thirty or forty miles
which that's a lot of fun um so we try to r[ide]- ride during the week to stay in shape for that
and um TI where i work has uh a fitness center so
a lot of times after work or maybe on the weekend we'd go over there and lift weights and do the treadmill and um
they have stair masters and all kinds of new machines that are fun to ride and
and workout on so
i try to i'm trying to stay in shape on a regular basis
i used to get into it and then get out of it based on my schedule so i'm trying to stay in in shape on a regular basis now
but it's a big commitment we don't have any kids yet so that's a lot of the part of it
[laughter]
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
uh-huh
that's why uh th[ey]- they uh really stress
um at TI they really stress staying in shape but like i[n]- staying fit overall fitness you know no smoking and all that but
it's it's hard to find uh a actual exercise regimen that works for you you know
because_1 like i know a lot of people that cycle they take their kids behind them_1 on the bikes and i don't know if that would work for me because
i don't know i wouldn't want to pull a kid over hilly terrain but you know it's really hard to find something that works
and i[t]- you know to find time
to do it and stay committed to it like three days a week or whatever
i think maybe walking or running would probably work because_1 you it doesn't take much time and much money or whatever
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
right
[silence]
[laughter]
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah um i've been learning a lot lately about
um i've been reading a book by Kenneth Cooper i don't know if you're f[amiliar]- are familiar with him
he was the pioneer of aerobics and all of health really he's kind of re[did]-
um uh just pretty much
the [noise] innovator of the whole exercise thing um and he was talking about the three things you could that cause
aging are smoking inactivity and <b_aside> what was the other one <e_aside>
[silence]
<b_aside> i think it was <e_aside> yeah obesity so if you can control those three areas then you are going to live longer you know
[silence]
because_1 those are risk factors so
anyway it's kind of a tip
[silence]
[laughter-really] [noise]
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
man
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
Dr Price
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
that's really interesting
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
hm
[silence]
and what's the name of this book again
[silence]
i'll have to remember that that'd be really interesting my husband wants to go into med school and be a neurosurgeon so he's really interested in the heart
[silence]
and he's in fact he's a well heart too i mean he's uh
[silence]
he's done a lot of research on
[silence]
like how your heart
[laughter-re[acts]-] [laughter-reacts] [laughter-reacts] [laughter-to] [laughter-exercise]
sorry he ju[st]- made me laugh um
[noise]
so
anyway
i have to remember that
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
hum-um
[silence]
if you get a chance read Dr Cooper's book on controlling cholesterol
that's a real good um he talks about that talks about
high risk factors and heart disease and all that
[silence]
<b_aside> that's right <e_aside>
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
you have a good ratio of good to bad cholesterol
[silence]
yeah
huh
[silence]
oh really
[silence]
that's good
[silence]
yeah
[silence]

yeah i think um this is a tough subject because uh when you come from two different parts of the country uh the political views are really different
i uh i i guess i've had to discuss a number of what might be considered controversial issues
i guess like like they're nothing i guess nothing is a[s]- as awful as abortion but like gun control 
and uh daycare and things like that and there are some very different views uh of the people connected with the program which i thought was really interesting you know 
[silence]
w[ell]- 
yeah well being i[n]- in in Baltimore see Maryland is um is sort um is prob[ably]- l[iberalism]- as a as a hub of liberalism [laughter] you know compared to the country uh you know very um 
in in many ways uh very liberal very somewhat to New England though Pennsylvania and New York uh i aren't actually as liberal Maryland is a very liberal uh
state so so wh[ere]- where here we have um we have gun control laws we probably have some of the strictest gun controls laws in the nation and most people in Maryland vote for that 
you know so it really is a different um
[silence]
yeah that's that's true i talked to a i had to talk about gun control with somebody and i talked with a woman who actually 
you know h[ad]- h[ad]- had just purchased a gun that day and was going target shooting you know and it was very different it was a whole different view it's really um 
this has opened my eyes to thinking you know at one time i just sat here and thought well how can anybody believe that because i'd really never met people that did
and now i talk to people that do so that's it's really interesting 
[silence]
um-hum 
[silence] 
um-hum 
[silence] 
yeah
[silence]
[laughter] yeah isn't it funny [laughter] 
[silence]
um-hum 
hm 
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah well you can possess them_1 here too but they have to be they're registered and uh like the the the Brady Bill that's currently being discussed nationally and whatever is very well supported here in gun control avenues and um 
[silence]
you have the seven day waiting period
yeah that's uh that's
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah that's true that's very true that's and that's the way m[ost]- i guess most of the um the 
the political organizations work you know the same i know the abortion issue with right to life and right to choose and 
and both of them are uh both want the extent of extremes so that they don't give anything for a balance you know there's there's always that difficulty 
[noise]
[silence]
um i would say i'm probably liberal yeah
yeah
sure
[silence]
well i'll tell you
i i think you know if they if they didn't give as much coverage to these idiots that burn the flag 
it would never happen do you know what i mean
it's only because they make a big stink over it but i i guess actually i believe that if somebody wants to burn the flag i guess that's their opportunity their their their right in the sense of freedom of speech but i- i would never 
yeah 
[silence]
yeah
well it's free[dom]- that they i think the idea of freedom of speech goes back to and i uh uh the the the whole aspect of being able to display your 
uh
your ideas you know the what the country stands on America stands on is that they can do that
i though i would never even consider it in a million years to do it myself i i i think uh 
you know but i i still what the stan[ds]- flag stands for i guess to me is that if somebody wants to voice their opinion or display their opinion openly and if that is a a way that they can show their opinion then they should be allowed 
uh
unless the bur[ning]- unless the actual fire hinders somebody's health and well-being you know but i i think that's i guess that's i thin[k]- that's my opinion yeah i guess you feel differently 
[silence] 
uh no but i think that's that's the it's that's taxpayer's money if somebody buys their own flag and and burns it that's fine but that that's you know that's destruction and o[f]- of uh 
public property and whatever 
[silence]
no i don't know i guess the symbolism oh i think what America stands for is the right to be able to disagree with the government
uh i think that's what's made democracy
yeah
[silence]
um-hum yeah 
[silence]
well that's that's true yeah but i think i i g[uess]- 
yeah i i g[uess]- i guess the idea you know they always keep saying like the framers um there uh of one of the Republican the appointees for the ju[dicial]- the judicial bench 
and they always talk about that they they feel that this person believes in the framing of the constitution what the original framers the ideals the original framers set down and um 
i believe that the idea of burning the flag is is in my understanding of how it was framed is that you this coun[try]- the thing about this country is that you can disagree with its government and you can display that 
uh i g[uess]- yeah i guess and and so that as a freedom of expression and speech and whatever i- i think that that's viable [noise] um 
as long as it's your flag and and you've made your your point i think yeah yeah because realistically like for you for you you don't think it's right 
and i would never do it i i love this country too much and that symbol means a lot to me 
um but i guess it's just one of those things where if they if that's what's something if a need for them 
you know
[silence]
yeah yes
no
[silence]
right
[noise]
yeah um-hum 
[silence]
um-hum 
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
i agree there too i agree with you there too i i the um 
i i it's i find it you know personally disgusting but i don't think that i don't think that uh 
we have a right to stop somebody from that you know the same i don't know i guess i get i get all all mixed up inside when 
yeah it g[ets]- when it's uh it's an emotional issue and you sit and you try and think about it logically and and and you know you try to say to yourself now emotionally this is a disgusting thing uh but logically 
um even you know for instance the pro-life pro-choice movement uh you know i don't know anybody that actually supports abortion 
but they would vote pro-choice 
because you know that's just a disgusting thing you know somebody an abortion means it's somebody's in trouble and that it's an awful thing 
you know but
[silence]
yeah
but it that's uh that's what i mean see mo[st]- but but realistically when you think of it it just sounds like such an awful thing and it evokes an emotional response i think that's the hardest thing i don't know if i could ever be a judge 
because some things emotionally just aren't you know
[silence]
no no i think the um
sometimes i guess what did i read recently the um the the uh Christian 
uh point i[s]- is always the point of well it's at conception 
but then um a friend of mine's a doctor and argues with others that conception is a biblical term and there's no concept of conception in medicine or biology 
so then that so that throws out that idea it makes it a religious discussion then so it['s]- i don't know it's very it's it's uh you know it's a it's a topsy turvy world and it's really something how 
um political ideas and viewpoints within one country can vary so much and also within um
within a
[silence]
yeah and how yeah how it'll sway from one e[xtreme]- one extreme to another 
uh i think that uh 
you know i i just read something i think in Time magazine uh ab[out]- about um protest on 

[silence] 
uh-huh 
[silence] 
well now you s[ay]- you say two different parts of the country what are are y[ou]- are you referring to yourself are you 
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
um-hum 
[silence] 
uh well of course uh you talk gun controls down here in Texas and you're asking to be lynched 
[silence]
hm um-hum 
[silence] 
well it's very true now i'm a a New Yorker by birth 
although i claim Florida as my home now
uh i have two sons living down there but 
but i also have two sons living elsewhere one in Tennessee one in Mississippi but i lived in Te[nnessee]- in Florida for ten years and i kind of like it down there but they had a gun control law which went a little bit too far 
i think uh well in your words they were a little bit too liberal
[laughter] 
i mean they p[ermitted]- they i believe if i'm correct i believe they permitted to carrying concealed weapons 
but they uh [noise] quickly did away with it i think in the next session they they uh modified it 
but it's still legal to own or possess weapons in uh uh Florida
[silence]
the the the one week uh uh seven day delay 
uh-huh
well i don't mind that too much now i'm i'm with the NRA myself and uh uh really the only objection we have 
is uh you you give a little and next thing you know uh s[omebody's]- somebody's trying to take more 
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
well the[n]- tell me do you consider yourself a liberal 
[silence]
well let me ask you this then how is your what is your feeling
about uh uh expressing yourself by burning the American flag
[silence]
um 
[silence]
well now wait a minute there there you just said it 
it's their right by f[reedom]- freedom of speech what does speech have to do with burning a flag 
[silence]
now uh well i i still go back to 
[silence]
then would you condone the burning of the capitol building
[silence]
uh then you don't draw a line between public property and uh uh uh
what a public uh 
[silence] 
[noise] symbol 
[silence]
uh yeah but here again i go back to the second amendment you can disagree by s[peech]- freedom of speech 
which has nothing to do with action
[silence] 
now i am i am adamantly against that
[silence]
um-hum 
[silence] 
yeah um-hum 
[silence]
no
[silence]
um-hum 
[silence]
well here again we uh even though you uh
physically you agree with me you you wouldn't do it yourself
but nevertheless you maintain that it's it is the right of of any citizen to burn the symbol of their country 
[silence]
uh
[silence]
um so long as it's their possession okay you're you're that's fine up to there except that uh the what that flag symbolizes is uh uh is this country 
and i used to know as a Boy Scout but all i remember was the red in the flag represented blood tha[t]- that was shed to to create this country and to maintain it 
and to me that's 
uh uh a a black eye to every man that ever [noise] uh carried a weapon or killed for his country 
[silence]
hm um-hum 
[silence]
it's very easy to do
[silence]
um-hum 
[silence]
well i think it should be permitted under certain circum[stances]- circumstances 
[silence]
um-hum 
[silence] 
well tell me has it ever been decided when when is a uh fetus a human 
[silence]
hm 
[silence] 
or they on their ow[n]- within the own uh society it can vary 
[silence]
um-hum 
[silence]

[noise]
[silence]
i'll let you go first
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
yeah i uh i spent a couple uh years down in uh Plano Texas
and uh i was one of the home owners down there that got taxed to death for the uh Plano uh school system
and uh i [vocalized-noise] you know i know that Texas doesn't have a state tax and so all the things come out of the the property taxes
and i was uh really shocked at the amount of taxes i ended up paying i was i was better off paying a state tax [vocalized-noise] back in Maryland where [laughter] than i was uh paying the uh property tax down there
uh what they did in Maryland to get around that is they uh they developed a renters tax solely for the purpose of paying for the services [noise] that the renters were getting including the uh educational services
and uh the tax was administered by um
[noise] the uh rental company that actually was managing the apartments so when uh long long time ago when i used to live in apartments i would pay a rent
payment every month and a tax payment every month
and the tax payment went to pay for the services that i was
getting as a a resident of that particular county
and uh that's the way it worked here in Maryland we have uh
a certain portion of your your property taxes uh goes to education but also a portion of the state tax that you pay
goes back into the county that you live in
to pay for the educational system
and so it it works out nice it it it makes it so that the
uh whole county now i- i know the concept of counties in Texas is quite a bit different than it is here in Maryland uh like Collin County uh would only equal about maybe an eighth the size of Baltimore County here in Maryland
i mean the the counties are much larger
you know in the the whole state of Maryland i believe there's only like uh fifteen counties
and so uh you know each county has their own school system an and it works out real nice um
the the flip side to this is are we getting what we're paying for and i don't believe so um a lot of things have come to head recently and i heard a report because of uh
uh the emphasis that the President was putting on education
you know um him running as our education president and then finally a couple of years later getting around to doing something um
[noise] they said since they imposed the federal regulations on education in other words they came up with this federalized system where everyone in the third grade would be taught basically the same thing
and then at the end of uh school year they would be tested and then they go into the fourth grade and everybody in the fourth grade's basically taught the same thing so when they came up with these this nationwide system of public schools
uh they gave some figures out and since it's inception uh they've the price has gone up per stu[dent]- the prices paid by the federal government per student has been thirty three percent
and so they're actually spending thirty three percent and that's real dollars you know adjusting it back to to the days you know when it started uh probably you know seventy years ago
and what they've said is that we haven't had a thirty three percent improvement in education
we've actually gone backwards
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah well they they've been having some problems uh even here in uh like Baltimore City which is a a pretty good ci[ty]- goo[d]- good sized city
uh they've been putting a lot of uh stress on it and of course speaking of stress the teachers are all getting stressed out from trying to you know do everything they're supposed to do and of course they've uh been cutting the teachers salaries because they say we don't have the money to do it and
all the services are costing more money and and everything uh but the uh a lot of emphas[is]- now is being put on you know when children used to be taught
you know like uh uh each child is individual you know they're not all the same
and
some students do horrible until like eighth grade some do horrible you know until they get to like tenth grade and then all of a sudden everything clicks in you know and then there are some students that you know read well at five years old
and you know seem to excel and so that the you know one of the things i heard proposed on uh one of the public radio stations up here was that we should go back to teaching children at their own speed
some kids
yeah
[silence]
and and uh
and on top of that they they make the child feel inferior
because he's not as good as another kid his same age i mean it's like
you know that's ridiculous
[silence]
yeah and uh you know i have uh i- i have five children total and i've got two out of the house already and i ha[ve]- i have two that are in uh eighth grade this year
and prior to their um
when i when they were in elementary school they were identi[fied]- identified as being slow
and so they put them into special programs and then we actually held them back in fourth grade
and
it wasn't until the last two years um last year my uh they're they're a set of twins um a boy and a girl last year the the uh boy twin started doing real well
and it it it everything started to click in for him and he knew what he needed to do um and this year it it happened for uh for the daughter
she just has been
really doing great this year and she has the right attitude towards school and everything and i think it's just a matter of everybody has to find their own path i remember when i was in school i did horrible
up until about
yeah about the seventh eighth grade i- i- i started to to come around and realize an and basically i got interested in math and uh never really did well in English but you know once you got interested in something
and things started to click in place
[vocalized-noise] then after that you take off
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
jeez
yeah it is um my children had a uh real culture shock um when we lived in Plano i guess i don't know if you've heard about the Plano school district but they're uh they really stress academics there
and uh God if your child is not an honor student well then [laughter] you're something wrong with you as a parent and tha[t]- that's kind of the way they are there
and uh when we moved back to Maryland um i moved to a uh a
[vocalized-noise] Baltimore County which is a northern county in Maryland
and it's basically a rural county once you get above about the half way point
and we lived you know in the northern part of the county uh we went from a uh
middle school in Texas that served fifty five square blocks to a uh middle school in Maryland that served fifty five square miles
and it was just a complete culture shock because i mean they they're riding on the bus in the morning with uh other kids that you know are a sleep because_1 they got up at three o'clock and were doing chores and [laughter-you] know it's
and they had uh ag[ricultural]- they had an ag[ricultural]- course uh i forget what it was called uh but it goes along the the lines of industrial arts but it's agricultural and where they had to raise a small animal
had to learn how to drive a tractor
they actually had to g[o]- take a driving test on the tractor i mean they just couldn't believe this and it was great they loved it
i mean they really enjoyed the courses
um
and it you know it made school fun for them again because prior to that school was just a big pain a drain
[silence]
yeah and it was you know it was like [laughter] kind of like the way we feel about going to work [laughter]
[laughter]
[silence]
but uh up here they seem to have made it uh a lot of fun for them_1 and they they seem to really enjoy it
[silence]

[silence]
well i think i don't know how your schools work back there but we support our schools here with property taxes
and the land owners or home owners are the ones that pay the school tax
so if you're renting a house or doing anything else you're not
actually contributing to the education of your children
and i think that's wrong i think everybody should contribute to the education of their children even if they had to raise the sales tax by one percent
then everybody going through the state would be supporting our education system
[vocalized-noise]
as it turns out we don't really have a
tremendous education system because they don't have the money they need to run it
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
no
[silence]
yeah yeah you would be
[silence]
oh
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
oh
[silence]
gee
[silence]
yeah um
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
ah
oh well that's pretty good
[silence]
oh yeah
[silence]
gee whiz
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
um-hum 
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
no huh-uh
well they say that Texas schools are some of the lowest in the nation that our high school graduates can't even match the national average 
so you know our school system down here is 
no where near perfect but they keep complaining they don't have the money to do it
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
oh yeah
yep 
[silence]
yeah
yeah they need to take things at their own speed
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
um-hum 
[silence]
yeah i think it'd be a lot better
you know each child has to learn at his own rate they can't keep force feeding things to each other and
or you know at the kids
[silence]
um-hum because_1 he can't do it 
yeah
[silence]
and it's not that he can't do it he just can't do it quite as fast or
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
all right
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
um-hum 
[silence]
all right
[silence]
huh all right 
jumped on out there
[silence]
that's good
[silence]
yeah i did too up until ninth or tenth grade
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah and see when i was a kid growing up and going to high school if i wanted to take a little electronics course i had a electronics course i could take but we lived out in the country and we didn't have all that 
fancy stuff to worry about you know we had our auto shop out there and our ag[ricultural]- shop and
you know we had just about every thing that we needed but they don't have it anymore 
there's a lot of things that they don't do in school anymore
o[ur]- our oldest boy goes to Lubbock High down here and they go to school four and half days a week 
[silence]
that's pretty weird
[silence]
no [vocalized-noise] 
[silence]
hum 
[silence]
gee
yeah
[silence]
um-hum 
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah
[laughter] 
i can imagine
[silence]
yeah
yeah that would be quite a shock
[silence]
um-hum 
[silence]
oh like Four H then
[silence]
all right
[silence]
all right
[silence]
yeah just something you do everyday
[silence]
[laughter-yeah] yeah just something i have to do everyday 
[silence]
that's good our oldest boy went into
school politics and made vice

[noise]
okay um i think that in this day and age everyone needs to have some sort of exposure to community service
because it it seems like and i'm i'm thinking of the commu[nity]- of community of people that are in jail now i think that maybe if if
if some of those people had gotten exposed to the community gotten exposed to working with other people that some of the things that they did they would not have done because they w[ould]- they understand people more they understand helping people more they understand the plight of people
[silence]
right
[silence]
um-hum um-hum
[silence]
um-hum i would think that for like people that are just filthy filthy rich
i think that they would benefit also in doing community service so that they
can see and i'm i'm speaking about people that are like born rich
and that's all they know and i'm thinking that community service would help them uh just get a feel of what else is out there how other people are living you know if they were to work in in uh uh
i don't know in a soup kitchen or something they would understand how other people live
and uh you know on the same note if poor if
poorer people [laughter] uh were working to to serve the community
i don't know they probably have a better perspective of of i don't know just life itself
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um
[silence]
um-hum demeanor yeah um-hum
[silence]
right
[silence]
that's great
[silence]
um-hum and i- i think that that you know this on the same note
being he was exposed to that and maybe he wasn't before and now he sees and i think that anybody that works
in the in some kind of service or for the community or something they can see you know you don't see what you don't you can't know what you don't see
you know so and you have to experience some things you know a lot of people know that people that other people are poor
but you they don't know what poor is
unless they actually see it and you know help or something
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
right
[silence]
there's something i i've really been skeptical of you know when you watch television you'll see the service announcement for children in other countries
and if you want to send like you know fifty cents a day
or something like that and you can help a child
it's
i don't know i guess it's just me but i don't know whether to trust that or not
i mean there are so many scams and things going on you know i would love to help somebody
you know but i just i can't bring myself to
trust
this this company who's trying to do this or whatever it is
you know just because people are [laughter-so] i don't know just today people are just so money hungry that i think they would do anything
and so i mean you don't know what they
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
right
[silence]
yeah more self-centered um
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
but you can't do that today
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
yeah even when when i first moved to Dallas from New York it seemed like Dallas was so open you know everybody left their doors open you just run in the store you leave your car running
you know and this was only uh well i guess it has been awhile it's been almost ten years since i moved here and it's amazing n[ow]- now how much it's changed i mean i don't go out i don't go outside at night you know
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
um-hum
[silence]
hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
wow
[silence]
wow
better
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
um
oh
God that would be the exact opposite here i mean if you leave something anywhere you might as well forget it
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
that is sad
[silence]
yeah yeah th[at]- that's a big that's a big thing with me i live in a one bedroom i'm single
and i've i could live in an apartment i live in Waco okay and you either live in really low priced housing or you live on the other side of town in the high price apartments
and i live i don't make a lot of money but i live in the high price apartments simply because i feel safe here
and i pay i'm paying probably the hundred or hundred and fifty dollars more
than i would be paying somewhere else but i wouldn't be able to sleep at night and that to me is worth the extra money for me to be you know i feel very safe where i am
you know instead of
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
right
[silence]

[silence]
um-hum yeah and it
[silence]
to
[silence]
yes yes i was talking to someone yesterday about that and we were saying that the basic uh the the basic family is is disrupted these days
and so i think you know before the father would work and the mother you know would stay home and having that mother there that base i think was a big part of of family a big part of
of what you know your your uh youngsters thought about what they did you know

[silence]

[silence]
[silence]
that's true um-hum i agree with you in the sense that uh i think that it's important for people to uh also share give something of themselves
and uh i think that there's too much
in the in uh a way of like self-gratification today
and there's not enough sharing
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah uh-huh
yeah
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah and i think the Peace Corps is great too because uh it you go to different countries and you see
uh you know in fact i saw an interview on TV the other night with uh Patrick Swayze and he's making a movie in
i think it's uh
Calcutta or either India somewhere where it's a it's a very poor poor country
and he said that people in the West
he said since being there and i guess he's been there about six months he said that his whole idea of what's important has changed
and he said that people have no idea he said of of what human sacrifice is you know since being there he's he's learned to what it is to be poor and have nothing and yet those people have
uh such uh a happy
uh yeah in in other words they don't dwell on on what they don't have they dwell on what they do have and they're happy with each other type of thing
and he said that out here he said that when he comes back he knows that it it's ju[st]- completely changed his life
[silence]
right
exactly
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
exactly right
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
right
[silence]
uh-huh
well i- i know that it that must be true especially if you do something along the lines of uh you know helping them learn how to survive how to plant how to find water and i've seen so many uh
extraordinary things on TV that people have done
working in the Peace Corps and how you know uh the people or the community they worked in is so much better
it's like one person can make a difference
and i- i really believe that they can in something like that
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yes
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
i know
and how do you [vocalized-noise]
yeah
[silence]
right
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
i know
it's true it really is it's the sad life i think today it's um
it's it it's not like it used to be even in in the years of my growing up i mean i'm fifty three years old and i have seen a town change from a town to a city
and it's uh people you know grow from a small town to a large town
and you would think that more people would be better you know share more do more you know be more community oriented and all but if they just get more uh
unto themselves kind of
right and and it's not the sharing of uh a neighbor to a neighbor
and we would go out and not even lock our doors
and not even worry about it
but today i mean you know it's like you wouldn't even think of doing that
if you don't have bars on the window you're not even safe you know
[silence]
uh-huh
yeah
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
in Dallas they
i was going to say because_1 i- i heard uh in fact i was talking to someone from Dallas uh just last week they was saying that uh in fact it was this one girl particularly that worked for TI and she had gone overseas to Tokyo
and she asked them there if there was some anywhere that she shouldn't go because_1 she was alone you know being a girl from another country and everything
and she said they thought for a few seconds and they said uh no there's nowhere that you can go that you would have to be afraid
they said to her that even if she left her purse
on the subway
okay that she would have that purse returned to her
this is how confident they were okay with nothing missing
okay this is a foreign country
and you would think you know uh being uh an American or whatever you know a foreigner there that that would be all the more reason that they'd take advantage of you
okay
and she told me she said she could tell them for fifteen minutes places not to go in in and around Dallas
and that's where she was from
she said even choosing her apartment she had to be so careful because of being a woman alone
you know she had there are certain
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
oh yeah
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
yeah
yeah
[silence]
yeah
[silence]
and that that's why i think if people were more exposed to
uh especially uh young kids getting out of high school
i mean at one time they would go into the service to have the same exposure and you know uh to further their worldliness so to speak
and go to see uh foreign countries that they would not necessarily be able to afford to see it was like they said join the Navy to see the world type of thing you know
but nowadays they don't do that anymore it's not uh a thing uh a lot of young men don't even uh
have the desire to go into the service
or to uh you know do something for someone else
and i don't know i- i attributed i think a lot of that to women working
you know to mothers not being at home
the bonding process yep
[silence]
it very definitely is
[silence]
that's right
[silence]
yep
and the thing is like i think a man can afford to support a woman
but the woman affords the luxuries
in in other words like anyone can live on a certain income no matter what it is you have to
so to speak okay it it's what's important to you
now a family i- i think that like girls today have children and six weeks later they're back to work
they don't even have a bonding with that child they don't eve[r]- ever see the
it's it's the most beautiful thing that happens between a mother and a child the first like say six years of life
so much happens in that period of time
and i mean once the child's in school if you had a job from say nine to three
big deal i mean th[ey're]- they're in school you're at work that's great but it's kids that come home and don't have a mother there or the kids are at home in the morning and the

[noise]
yeah i've been sitting here alternately reading and watching [laughter-television]
you were he was waiting for what again
[silence]
that's what this was yeah well let me go a head and push one okay okay
[noise]
well basically i like uh comedy shows [laughter]
uh Murphy Brown uh Designing Women that ilk
yeah what do you like
[laughter]
[silence]
oh okay
[silence]
[laughter]
that's okay we've been married eleven years and um we went through that after about five years of marriage my old TV that i had from college when we got married finally went out and we went we made it for about almost eighteen months without a television
yeah but then all of a sudden when you get one you realize um
gee [laughter] i needed that you know and then you get to remote control the stereo phonic whatever all of those things
yeah oh yeah and then you never use the VCR and now we have two of them_1 and now it's like we're just glad we never went out and bought a compact disk player cause we wouldn't use [laughter-it]
yeah i mean it's cause your never home you know you're working you're at school
well i don't know TV shows what can i tell you um basically junk that's on [laughter-television]
that's my opinion yeah um
i like things like i just mentioned have you ever seen Murphy Brown or anything like that
you don't think so uh that's the one with Candice Bergen in it um
[silence]
yeah that would do it
[silence]
right nobody does yeah then uh-huh i know
[silence]
and the uh well i don't [vocalized-noise] you're probably at least ten years younger then i am but i could tell you in school that uh the only thing that ever saw in the dorm was uh the one soap opera All My Children and until then i never paid attention to soap operas
and to this day twenty years later i'm like i'm in my thirties i'm not that old but i'm going jeez i can't believe that thing's still on [laughter-television]
[laughter]
[silence]
yeah they you know about the only other kinds of things i like um i like to watch a lot of news um don't you miss that with not having a television so far
how long has it been since you've had one
[silence]
[laughter-oh] [laughter-my] [laughter-God] yeah you've got about another six months and then you'll get one
[laughter] by then
[silence]
uh-huh
[silence]
yeah
yeah my husband is an only child too and he did miss it that's kind of why we got back after eighteen months [laughter]
and m[e]- i'm trying to think about the only other show i watch
[vocalized-noise]
[silence]
yeah i like the the Cosby LA Law is probably i've seen Cheers more then that i hate to admit but um
Cheers yeah i thought it was good i've actually been to that bar in Boston it's a ni[ce]- you know it's a pretty funny show yeah it's kind of a
it's just a you know over priced
[laughter]
downtown Boston yuppie you know tourist attraction
i'm trying to think what else is on television i know it's like
[silence]
yeah who didn't isn't that sad
[silence]
um-hum
[silence]
no no no i like the pro actually i like pro basketball as opposed to ev[en]- i watch pro football but i like the NBA playoffs
back when like the Pistons were in them_1 and now where are you calling from
oh we're
Sherman Te[xas]- oh i'm in Dallas i was just saying where am i calling you from yeah well then well i don't know if you like the the Mavericks or not or
they haven't been that good this year um we're supposed to talk about television let's stay o[n]-
[laughter] i don't have a TV
yeah i'm talking to you from Dallas uh-huh
[silence]
my voice you mean oh no that's just because i've moved around and
i'm originally from Pennsylvania so

[silence]
uh actually i'm a big Chicago Bears fan real big and um i always watch them no matter who's on of course you like them too right do you
oh okay
yeah there you go and then [laughter]
and uh i'm trying to think what else i like to watch on television {sportswise} i like i like tennis so i mean i'm not i haven't played in years but um i just like to watch you know two two players really get go at it on television
it gets boring after a while but i don't go ahead
Oprah
[silence]
uh-huh
yeah on the on the tracks yeah
[silence]
maybe cause she got chubby again or something
[laughter]
[silence]
was she was her show big when you where in school since you haven't been out that long
was her show big when you where in college since you haven't been that long
was it
[silence]
yeah i saw reruns of it i saw yeah tapes of [laughter] yeah
[silence]
gee i know isn't that terrible i know i guess with that money who cares
[laughter] i don't know
yeah let's see what all's on television oh if you don't have a VCR we just got one after nine years don't even spend your money on it yeah cause you know if you like movies like we do
you do it once in awhile and then you know you see it when it first comes out if you really want to see it and then it usually comes on television within two years you know
[silence]
yeah really that's television i don't know in general on this project we're suppose to talk about [laughter-that] so i mean i'm that's okay don't [vocalized-noise] i mean i- i always digress
[silence]
yeah oh that's okay
i had one lady one time they called in i just signed up my husband had been on this project um and i- i she called in and it was all about we don't have children and it's all about um sending your kids to college and why you would advise them
and she was from Boston and she was i shouldn't talk about that but she was [laughter] pretend she was a television show and sh[e]- she was very snooty and uh her kids were going to places like Amherst and BU and i said i didn't know what that was i she went oh and i thought um
so i know i mean it's like don't worry about it television at least you know everybody's at least seen telev[ision]- during the war did you laugh when they had that man on uh what was his name Wolf Blitzer
that guy that was a reporter for CNN
his name is Wolf Blitzer did you see it him when he was doing the coverage of The Gulf

i can't remember his [laughter-name]
yeah but just the they made jokes about him like on the Carson Show and all that Jay Leno
[silence]
huh
yeah he's funny
[silence]
yeah Saturday Night Live has changed a lot if you haven't seen it in about a year
i mean i haven't seen it in a couple of months but used to
uh yeah actually i think it has i mean they finally like Dana Carvey and some of those people they really have funny characters on there
yeah they have one character on there they just call it Pat and they you don't know if it's a man or a [laughter-woman]
and they say well they're trying to deduce what he what he or she is so to see if it's a female they say well do you carry a purse and Pat says no i carry a fanny [laughter-pack]
[laughter]
so you still don't know because a fanny pack is man or nowadays you know
[laughter] yeah it's weird [laughter]
yeah it's pre[tty]- yeah it is pretty funny i mean they do some crazy things
