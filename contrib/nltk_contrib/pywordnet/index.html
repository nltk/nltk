<H1>PyWordNet - A Python Interface to WordNet</H1><H2>Overview</H2><P>PyWordNet is a <A HREF="http://www.python.org/">Python</A> interface to the <A HREF="http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/">WordNet</A> database of word
meanings and lexical relationships.&nbsp; (A lexical relationship is a
relationship between words, such as <STRONG>synonym</STRONG>, <STRONG>antonym</STRONG>,
<STRONG>hypernym</STRONG> (<CODE>"poodle"</CODE> -> <CODE>"dog"</CODE>), and <STRONG>hyponym</STRONG>
(<CODE>"poodle"</CODE> -> <CODE>"dog"</CODE>).</P><P>PyWordNet presents a concise interface to WordNet, that allows the
user to type expressions such as <CODE>N['dog']</CODE>,
<CODE>hyponyms(N['dog'][0])</CODE>, and <CODE>closure(ADJ['red'], SYNONYM)</CODE> to
query the database.</P><P>If Python is already installed at your site, download PyWordNet from
the project home page, at
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywordnet">http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywordnet</A>. For more information, read
the documentation at the top of the source file, or skip to the
example session <A HREF="">Example Session</A> below.</P><P>PyWordNet is hosted on <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net">SourceForge</A> <IMG
