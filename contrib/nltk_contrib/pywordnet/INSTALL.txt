Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
In Brief
========
- Put the \*.py files where Python can see them.
- Download the WordNet database files from
  http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/.
- Do one of:
    - Set the WNHOME environment variable to the pathname of WordNet's
      "Dictionary" or "dict" directory.
    - Set the WNSEARCHDIR environment variable to the pathname of the
      directory that _contains_ this directory.
    - Place an alias to WordNet's "Dictionary" (Mac) or "dict" (UNIX
      or PC) directory in Python's home directory (and name the alias
      "Dictionary" or "dict", respectively);

Specific Platforms
==================
MacOS
-----
Download and decompress the zip file from http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywordnet, and copy the \*.py files to your Python
path.

Make an alias to ``<var>{Wordnet}</var>:Database`` (name the
alias "``Database``"), and place it in your
MacPython folder.&nbsp; (There are additional requirements for
getting PyWordNet to work with the UNIX download of wn1.7.&nbsp;
If you're trying to do this and have trouble, send me at
steele@cs.brandeis.edu.)

UNIX
----
Set the ``WNHOME`` environment variable to the location of
the WordNet installation (the directory that contains ``dict`` as a
subdirectory).

Download the \*.tar.gz file from http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywordnet, and install it::

  prompt> tar xfz pywordnet-1.2.1.tar.gz
  prompt> cd pywordnet-1.2.1
  prompt> python setup.py install

If you don't have permission to install the files, you can instead
add the name of the directory they're in to your Python path, or
copy the \*.py files to your working directory.

Windows
-------
Download and execute the \*.exe file from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywordnet to install the Python files.

Set the ``WNHOME`` environment variable to the location of
the WordNet installation (the directory that contains ``dict`` as a
subdirectory).

Testing
=======
Launch Python, and test the system::

  import wordnet
  wordnet._test()

Try it out by executing ``N['dog']`` to retrieve the entry for
"dog". See the `Example Session`_ or the file documentation for a
longer list of examples.
