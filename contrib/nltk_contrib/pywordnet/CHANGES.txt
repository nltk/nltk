PyWordNet Change History
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 1.4
===========
New Features
------------
- Incorporated Klaus Reis <reis@cs.cmu.edu>'s implementation of
  Lexname (not yet documented).

API Changes
-----------
- Added ``Word.getSenses()``, which will replace the deprecated
  ``Word.sense()``.  (It wasn't clear under the old naming scheme which
  were data fields and which were methods.)  Other new methods:
  ``Word.getAdjectivePositions``, ``Synset.getSenses``,
  ``Synset.getPointers``, ``Synset.getPointerTargets``,
  ``Sense.getPointers``, ``Sense.getPointerTargets``, ``Sense.getSenses``,
  ``Sense.getWord``, ``Pointer.getSource``, ``Pointer.getTarget``.
- Remove ``Word.string``, ``Sense.string``, and ``Synset.string``. (Use
  ``object.form`` instead.)
- Added ``Word.getPointers`` and ``Word.getPointerTargets``, that raise an
  error and direct the user to the corresponding methods on sense and
  synset.

Bug fixes
---------
- ``morphy('hardrock', 'adv')`` no longer goes into an infinite loop.
  (This was caused by a bug in ``binarySearchFile`` where the search
  position was at the end of the file.)

Other Changes
-------------
- Updated doctest examples to wn1.7 database. (``wordnet._test()`` is
  therefore no longer useful with a wn1.6 database, since their are
  more synsets and they're in a different order, and so on.)
- Updated comments.  ``help(wordnet)`` is now useful.

Version 1.3 (8/5/2001)
======================
- The windows version looks for unix-style names too, so that it will
  work with wn1.7

Version 1.2	(4/15/1999)
