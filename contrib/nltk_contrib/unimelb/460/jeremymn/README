Supplied files:

report.pdf : A report on the project. Read this first.

corpus.rnd : A randomly sorted corpus of document (sentence) samples from 8 
languages. One document to a line.

corr_lans : A list of the correct language of each document in corpus.rnd.
Necessary for the analysis on the main output, done by check_corr.

proj.py : A python-NLTK program for running an unsupervised language identifier.
Usage is ./proj.py ./corpus.rnd [-r] [-t Value] [-p Value] [-d]
Arguments MUST be in this order. Implementing order dependence was not useful.
First argument is the corpus of documents to be identified.
Next argument is whether relative entropy (-r) or skew divergence (default) is
   used.
Next argument is threshold value for clustering. Defaults to 350 with skew
   divergence, 3.5 with relative entropy.
Next argument is number of passes after the first. Defaults to 0 (one pass).
Next argument is whether dreaming is performed, with one extra pass.

test_suite : A bash test suite for running proj.py using a number of thresholds
for both relative entropy and skew divergence. Usage is ./test_suite.
Output files skew.200, skew.250, ... skew.700, rel.20, rel.25, ... rel.70 in
results directory.

check_corr : A perl script that loads each of the output files from the test
suite and calculates the number of correct and incorrect items, as well as the
metric. Output files skew.200.chk, skew.250.chk, etc.

README : This file.

Sample usage:
Run test_suite. Then run check_corr and sample some of the metric values after
0, 1, and 2 passes. This may take a few minutes.
Change the value of threshinc (near the top of python script) to 2.0.
Run proj.py corpus.rnd -r 3.5 -p 2 -d and examine dreaming on relative entropy
with two passes. This may take several minutes.
