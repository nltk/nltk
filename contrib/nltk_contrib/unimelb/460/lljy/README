README FOR GP-ALIGNMENT PROJECT
===============================

Required packages
-----------------
In order to run, japanese codecs are required for python. These are typically
provided by a package named python-japanesecodecs or python-cjkcodecs in most
distributions.

Data sets
---------
The Edict and evaluation data sets are available at:

        /home/pgrad/lljy/local/edict.data.bz2
        /home/pgrad/lljy/local/evaluation.data.bz2


How to run
----------
Run ./segment.py for usage information. A typical run on the evaluation data
set could be

        ./segment.py -e evaluation.data align.out

which would use the evaluation data as input and write the output alignments
to align.out.

See the report for a high-level description of the other modules, or run
epydoc on them for a low-level description.

Report peculiarities
--------------------

I had major encoding problems in trying to get latex to do CJK characters. At
the moment, only the dvi version outputs the Japanese appropriately in a
Japanese enabled xdvi. Japanese fonts are lost on conversion to ps or pdf.
Basically, despite hard work, most of the examples won't be that great to look
at. Sorry! For the not so faint of heart, the latex source with dvi output is
provided in doc.tgz.
