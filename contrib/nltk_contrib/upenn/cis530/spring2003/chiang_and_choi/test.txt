Life is all about understanding, communication and care. 
Being an individual in this nochanlant world, we have learned to be tough and stand on our own. 
How they call it? Oh, yes, competition takes the lead. 

There is no need to give others an image of how excellent you are. You are only given decades of 
life. If you choose to build up the image, it is your choice.  I rather choose to be myself and I know 
where I am from.
