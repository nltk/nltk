Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
    NLTK is a Python package that simplifies the construction of
    programs that process natural language; and defines standard
    interfaces between the different components of an NLP system.  It
    was designed primarily to help teach graduate and undergraduate
    students about computational linguistics; but it is also useful as
    a framework for implementing research projects.

Contributions Package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    This package contains third-party contributions to the NLTK.
    These Python programs are designed to work with NLTK, and perform
    a wide variety of natural language processing tasks.  While they
    are not integrated into NLTK (yet), these programs may be of
    interest to NLTK developers and to people teaching NLP using
    Python.

    Contributed modules are organized using a hierarchy of Python
    packages.  For a description of the packages and modules included
    in the contributions package, see its reference documentation:

        <http://nltk.sourceforge.net/contrib>

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    A substantial amount of documentation about how to use NLTK is
    available from the nltk home page:

        <http://nltk.sourceforge.net>

Mailing Lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    There are three mailing lists associated with NTLK:
      - nltk-announce: Public information and announcements
        about NLTK (very low volume)
      - nltk-devel: Discussions between NLTK developers
      - nltk-commits: CVS commit logs for NLTK
