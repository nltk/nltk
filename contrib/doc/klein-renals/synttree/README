      The synttree package for typesetting syntactic trees

      Version 1.4

The "synttree" package provides a simple way to typeset syntactic trees as
used in Chomsky's Generative Grammar.

To use the package, download synttree.dtx and synttree.ins. Then run

  tex synttree.ins

to generate synttree.sty. Place that file somewhere LaTeX will find it.

Documentation can be found in synttree.pdf (generated from synttree.dtx).
