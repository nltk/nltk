"""
An implementation of the Hole Semantics model, following Blackburn and Bos,
Representation and Inference for Natural Language (CSLI, 2005).

The semantic representations are built by the grammar hole.cfg.
This module contains driver code to read in sentences and parse them
according to a hole semantics grammar.

After parsing, the semantic representation is in the form of an underspecified
representation that is not easy to read.  We use a "plugging" algorithm to
convert that representation into first-order logic formulas.  These can be
displayed textually or graphically.
"""

# Note that in this code there may be multiple types of trees being referred to:
#
# 1. parse trees
# 2. the underspecified representation
# 3. first-order logic formula trees
# 4. the search space when plugging (search tree)

    and finding legal ways to plug holes with labels.
