8. Analyzing Sentence Structure
===============================

Earlier chapters focused on words: how to identify them,
analyze their structure, assign them to lexical categories,
and access their meanings.
We have also seen how to identify patterns in word sequences or n-grams.
However, these methods only scratch the surface of the complex constraints
that govern sentences.
We need a way to deal with the ambiguity that natural language is famous for.
We also need to be able to cope with the fact that there are an unlimited number
of possible sentences, and we can only write finite programs to analyze their
structures and discover their meanings.
 
The goal of this chapter is to answer the following questions:

#. How can we use a formal grammar to describe the structure of an unlimited set of sentences?
#. How do we represent the structure of sentences using syntax trees?
#. How do parsers analyze a sentence and automatically build a syntax tree?

Along the way, we will cover the fundamentals of English syntax, and
see that there are systematic aspects of meaning that are much easier
to capture once we have identified the structure of sentences.

.. _sec-dilemmas:

-------------------------
Some Grammatical Dilemmas
-------------------------


Linguistic Data and Unlimited Possibilities
-------------------------------------------

Previous chapters have shown you how to process and analyse text
corpora, and we have stressed the challenges for NLP in dealing with
the vast amount of electronic language data that is growing
daily. Let's consider this data more closely, and make the thought
experiment that we have a gigantic corpus consisting of everything
that has been either uttered or written in English over, say, the last
50 years. Would we be justified in calling this corpus "the language
of modern English"? There are a number of reasons why we might answer
No. Recall that in chap-words_, we asked you to search
the web for instances of the pattern `the of`:lx:.  Although it is
easy to find examples on the web containing this word sequence, such as
`New man at the of IMG`:lx:
(``http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2387900/New-man-at-the-of-IMG.html``),
speakers of English will say that most such examples are errors, and
therefore not part of English after all. 

Accordingly, we can argue
that the "modern English" is not equivalent to the very big
set of word sequences in our imaginary corpus. Speakers
of English can make judgements about these sequences, and will reject
some of them as being ungrammatical. 

Equally, it is easy to compose a new sentence and have speakers agree that it is perfectly
good English.  For example, sentences have an interesting property
that they can be embedded inside larger sentences.  Consider the
following sentences:

.. ex::
  .. ex:: Usain Bolt broke the 100m record
  .. ex:: The Jamaica Observer reported that Usain Bolt broke the 100m record 
  .. ex:: Andre said The Jamaica Observer reported that Usain Bolt broke the 100m record
  .. ex:: I think Andre said the Jamaica Observer reported that Usain Bolt broke the 100m record

If we replaced whole sentences with the symbol ``S``, we would see patterns like
`Andre said`:lx: ``S`` and `I think`:lx: ``S``.  These are templates for taking a sentence
and constructing a bigger sentence.  There are other templates we can use, like
``S`` `but`:lx: ``S``, and ``S`` `when`:lx: ``S``.  With a bit of ingenuity we can
construct some really long sentences using these templates.
Here's an impressive example from a Winnie the Pooh story by A.A. Milne,
*In which Piglet is Entirely Surrounded by Water*: 

   [You can imagine Piglet's joy when at last the ship came in sight of
   him.] In after-years he liked to think that he had been in Very
   Great Danger during the Terrible Flood, but the only danger he had
   really been in was the last half-hour of his imprisonment, when
   Owl, who had just flown up, sat on a branch of his tree to comfort
   him, and told him a very long story about an aunt who had once laid
   a seagull's egg by mistake, and the story went on and on, rather
   like this sentence, until Piglet who was listening out of his
   window without much hope, went to sleep quietly and naturally,
   slipping slowly out of the window towards the water until he was
   only hanging on by his toes, at which moment, luckily, a sudden
   loud squawk from Owl, which was really part of the story, being
   what his aunt said, woke the Piglet up and just gave him time to
   jerk himself back into safety and say, "How interesting, and did
   she?" when |mdash| well, you can imagine his joy when at last he saw
   the good ship, Brain of Pooh (Captain, C. Robin; 1st Mate, P. Bear)
   coming over the sea to rescue him...

This long sentence actually has a simple structure that begins
`S but S when S`:lx:.  We can see from this example that language
provides us with constructions which seem to allow us to extend
sentences indefinitely.  It is also striking that
we can understand sentences of arbitrary length
that we've never heard before:  it's not hard to concoct an
entirely novel sentence, one that has probably never been used before
in the history of the language, yet all speakers of the language
will understand it.

The purpose of a grammar is to give an explicit description of a
language. But the way in which we think of a grammar is closely
intertwined with what we consider to be a language. Is it a 
large but finite set of observed utterances and written texts? Is it
something more abstract like the implicit knowledge that competent
speakers have about grammatical sentences? Or is it some combination
of the two? We won't take a stand on this issue, but instead will
introduce the main approaches.

In this chapter, we will adopt the formal framework
of "generative grammar", in which
a "language" is considered to be nothing more than an
enormous collection of all grammatical sentences, and a
grammar is a formal notation that can be used for "generating" the
members of this set.  Grammars use recursive `productions`:dt:
of the form ``S`` |rarr| ``S`` `and`:lx: ``S``, as we will explore in
sec-context-free-grammar_.  In chap-semantics_ we will extend this,
to automatically build up the meaning of a sentence out of the meanings
of its parts.

Ubiquitous Ambiguity
--------------------

A well-known example of ambiguity is shown in ex-marx-elephant_,
from the Groucho Marx movie, *Animal Crackers* (1930):

.. _ex-marx-elephant:
.. ex::

   While hunting in Africa, I shot an elephant in my pajamas.
   How an elephant got into my pajamas I'll never know.

Let's take a closer look at the ambiguity in the phrase:
`I shot an elephant in my pajamas`:lx:.  First we
need to define a simple grammar:

    >>> groucho_grammar = nltk.parse_cfg("""
    ... S -> NP VP
    ... PP -> P NP
    ... NP -> Det N | Det N PP | 'I'
    ... VP -> V NP | VP PP
    ... Det -> 'an' | 'my'
    ... N -> 'elephant' | 'pajamas'
    ... V -> 'shot' 
    ... P -> 'in' 
    ... """)

This grammar permits the sentence to be analyzed in two ways,
depending on whether the prepositional phrase `in my pajamas`:lx:
describes the elephant or the shooting event.

    >>> sent = ['I', 'shot', 'an', 'elephant', 'in', 'my', 'pajamas']
    >>> parser = nltk.ChartParser(groucho_grammar) 
    >>> trees = parser.nbest_parse(sent)
    >>> for tree in trees:
    ...     print tree
    ... 
    (S
      (NP I)
      (VP
        (V shot)
        (NP (Det an) (N elephant) (PP (P in) (NP (Det my) (N pajamas))))))
    (S
      (NP I)
      (VP
        (VP (V shot) (NP (Det an) (N elephant)))
        (PP (P in) (NP (Det my) (N pajamas)))))

The program produces two bracketed structures, which we can depict as
trees, as shown in ex-elephant_:

.. _ex-elephant:
.. ex::

  .. ex::
    .. tree:: (S (NP I) (VP (V shot)  (NP (Det an) (N elephant) (PP (P in) (NP (Det my) (N pajamas)))))) 

  .. ex::
    .. tree:: (S (NP I) (VP (VP (V shot) (NP (Det an) (N elephant))) (PP (P in) (NP (Det my) (N pajamas))))) 

Notice that there's no ambiguity concerning the meaning of any of the words;
e.g. the word `shot`:lx: doesn't refer to the act of using a gun in the first sentence,
and using a camera in the second sentence.

.. note:: |TRY|
   Consider the following sentences and see if you can think of two quite different
   interpretations: `Fighting animals could be dangerous.`:lx:
   `Visiting relatives can be tiresome.`:lx:  Is ambiguity of the individual
   words to blame?  If not, what is the cause of the ambiguity?

This chapter presents grammars and parsing, as the formal and
computational methods for investigating and modeling the linguistic
phenomena we have been discussing.
As we shall see, patterns of well-formedness and ill-formedness in a
sequence of words can be understood with respect to the 
phrase structure and dependencies.  We can develop formal
models of these structures using grammars and parsers.
As before, a key motivation is natural language *understanding*.  How
much more of the meaning of a text can we access when we can reliably
recognize the linguistic structures it contains?  Having read in a
text, can a program "understand" it enough to be able to answer simple
questions about "what happened" or "who did what to whom"?  Also as
before, we will develop simple programs to process annotated corpora
and perform useful tasks.


.. _sec-whats-the-use-of-syntax:


-------------------------
What's the Use of Syntax?
-------------------------


Beyond n-grams
--------------

We gave an example in chap-corpora_ of how to use
the frequency information in bigrams to generate text that seems
perfectly acceptable for small sequences of words but rapidly
degenerates into nonsense. Here's another pair of examples that we created by
computing the bigrams over the text of a childrens' story, *The
Adventures of Buster Brown* (``http://www.gutenberg.org/files/22816/22816.txt``):

.. _ex-salad:
.. ex:: 
    .. ex:: He roared with me the pail slip down his back

    .. ex:: The worst part and clumsy looking for whoever heard light

You intuitively know that these sequences are "word-salad", but you
probably find it hard to pin down what's wrong with them. One
benefit of studying grammar is that it provides a conceptual framework
and vocabulary for spelling out these intuitions. Let's take a closer look
at the sequence `the worst part and clumsy looking`:lx:. This looks like a `coordinate
structure`:dt:, where two phrases are joined by a coordinating
conjunction such as `and`:lx:, `but`:lx: or `or`:lx:. Here's an
informal (and simplified) statement of how coordination works
syntactically:

Coordinate Structure:

    If *v*\ :sub:`1` and *v*\ :sub:`2` are both phrases of grammatical
    category *X*, then *v*\ :sub:`1` `and`:lx: *v*\ :sub:`2` is also a
    phrase of category  *X*.

Here are a couple of examples. In the first, two ``NP``\ s (noun
phrases) have been conjoined to make an ``NP``, while in the second,
two ``AP``\ s (adjective phrases) have been conjoined to make an
``AP``.

.. _ex-coord:
.. ex:: 
    .. ex:: The book's ending was (NP *the worst part and the best part*) for me.

    .. ex:: On land they are (AP *slow and clumsy looking*).

What we `can't`:em: do is conjoin an ``NP`` and an ``AP``, which is
why `the worst part and clumsy looking`:lx: is ungrammatical.
Before we can formalize these ideas, we need to
understand the concept of `constituent structure`:dt:.

Constituent structure is based on the observation that words combine
with other words to form units. The evidence that a sequence of words
forms such a unit is given by substitutability |mdash| that is, a
sequence of words in a well-formed sentence can be replaced by a
shorter sequence without rendering the sentence ill-formed. To clarify
this idea, consider the following sentence:

.. _ex-bb0:
.. ex:: The little bear saw the fine fat trout in the brook.

The fact that we can substitute `He`:lx: for `The little bear`:lx:
indicates that the latter sequence is a unit. By contrast, we cannot
replace  `little bear saw`:lx: in the same way.

.. explain * ?


.. ex:: 
    .. ex :: He saw the fine fat trout in the brook.
    .. ex :: \*The he the fine fat trout in the brook.

In fig-ic-diagram_, we systematically substitute longer sequences
by shorter ones in a way which preserves grammaticality. Each sequence
that forms a unit can in fact be replaced by a single word, and we end
up with just two elements.

.. _fig-ic-diagram: 
.. figure:: ../images/ic_diagram.png
   :scale: 25:100:35

   Substitution of Word Sequences: working from the top row, we can replace
   particular sequences of words (e.g. `the brook`:lx:) with individual
   words (e.g. `it`:lx:); repeating this process we arrive at a grammatical
   two-word sentence.

In fig-ic-diagram-labeled_, we have added
grammatical category labels to the words we saw in the earlier figure.
The labels ``NP``, ``VP``, and ``PP`` stand for `noun phrase`:dt:,
`verb phrase`:dt: and `prepositional phrase`:dt: respectively. 

.. _fig-ic-diagram-labeled: 
.. figure:: ../images/ic_diagram_labeled.png
   :scale: 25:100:35

   Substitution of Word Sequences Plus Grammatical Categories:
   This diagram reproduces fig-ic-diagram_ along with grammatical
   categories corresponding to noun phrases (``NP``), verb phrases (``VP``),
   prepositional phrases (``PP``), and nominals (``Nom``).

If we now strip out the words apart from the topmost row, add an
``S`` node, and flip the figure over, we end up with a standard
phrase structure tree, shown in ex-phrase-structure-tree_.
Each node in this tree (including the words) is called
a `constituent`:dt:.  The `immediate constituents`:dt: of
``S`` are ``NP`` and ``VP``.

.. _ex-phrase-structure-tree:
.. ex::
    .. tree:: (S (NP (Det the)(Nom (Adj little)(N bear)))(VP (VP (V saw) (NP (Det the)(Nom (Adj fine)(Adj fat)(N trout))))(PP (P in) (NP(Det the)(Nom (N brook))))))

As we will see in the next section, a grammar specifies how the sentence
can be subdivided into its immediate constituents, and how these can be further
subdivided until we reach the level of individual words.

.. note::
   As we saw in sec-dilemmas_, sentences can have arbitrary length.
   Consequently, phrase structure trees can have arbitrary `depth`:em:.
   The cascaded chunk parsers we saw in sec-recursion-in-linguistic-structure_
   can only produce structures of bounded depth, so chunking methods
   aren't applicable here.

.. _sec-context-free-grammar:

--------------------
Context Free Grammar
--------------------

A Simple Grammar
----------------

.. XXX say more about what "admitted by a grammar" means?

Let's start off by looking at a simple context-free grammar.  By
convention, the left-hand-side of the first production is the
`start-symbol`:dt: of the grammar, typically ``S``, and all
well-formed trees must have this symbol as their root label. In
|NLTK|, context-free grammars are defined in the ``nltk.grammar``
module.  In code-cfg1_ we define a grammar and show how to parse a
simple sentence admitted by the grammar.

.. pylisting:: code-cfg1
   :caption: A Simple Context-Free Grammar

   grammar1 = nltk.parse_cfg("""
     S -> NP VP
     VP -> V NP | V NP PP
     PP -> P NP
     V -> "saw" | "ate" | "walked"
     NP -> "John" | "Mary" | "Bob" | Det N | Det N PP
     Det -> "a" | "an" | "the" | "my"
     N -> "man" | "dog" | "cat" | "telescope" | "park"
     P -> "in" | "on" | "by" | "with"
     """)

   >>> sent = "Mary saw Bob".split()
   >>> rd_parser = nltk.RecursiveDescentParser(grammar1)
   >>> for tree in rd_parser.nbest_parse(sent):
   ...      print tree
   (S (NP Mary) (VP (V saw) (NP Bob)))


The grammar in code-cfg1_ contains productions involving various syntactic categories,
as laid out in tab-syncat_.

.. table:: tab-syncat

   ======    ====================    =====================
   Symbol    Meaning                 Example

   VP        verb phrase             `saw a park`:lx:
   PP        prepositional phrase    `with a telescope`:lx:
   Det       determiner              `the`:lx:
   N         noun                    `dog`:lx:
   V         verb                    `walked`:lx:
   P         preposition             `in`:lx:
   ======    ====================    =====================

   Syntactic Categories


A production like ``VP -> V NP | V NP PP`` has a disjunction on the
righthand side, shown by the ``|`` and is an abbreviation for the two productions 
``VP -> V NP`` and ``VP -> V NP PP``.

.. _fig-parse-rdparsewindow:
.. figure:: ../images/parse_rdparsewindow.png
   :scale: 100

   Recursive Descent Parser Demo: This tool allows you to watch the operation of
   a recursive descent parser as it grows the parse tree and matches it against
   the input words.

.. note |TRY|
   Try developing a simple grammar of your own, using the
   recursive descent parser application, ``nltk.app.rdparser()``,
   shown in fig-parse-rdparsewindow_.
   It comes already loaded with a sample grammar, but you can
   edit this as you please (using the ``Edit`` menu).
   Change the grammar, and the sentence to be parsed, and
   run the parser using the *autostep* button.

If we parse the sentence `The dog saw a man in the park` using
the grammar shown in code-cfg1_, we end up with two trees, similar to
those we saw for ex-elephant_:

.. ex::
  .. ex::
    .. tree:: (S (NP (Det the) (N dog))
                 (VP (V saw)
                     (NP (Det a) (N man))
                     (PP (P in) (NP (Det the) (N park)))))
  .. ex::
    .. tree:: (S (NP (Det the) (N dog))
                 (VP (V saw)
                     (NP (Det a)
                         (N man)
                         (PP (P in) (NP (Det the) (N park))))))

Since our grammar licenses two trees for this sentence, the sentence is
said to be :dt:`structurally ambiguous`.  The ambiguity in question is called
a `prepositional phrase attachment ambiguity`:idx:, as we saw earlier in this chapter.
As you may recall, it is an ambiguity about attachment since the
``PP`` `in the park`:lx: needs to be attached to one of two places
in the tree: either as a child of ``VP`` or else as a child of ``NP``.
When the ``PP`` is attached to ``VP``, the intended interpretation
is that the seeing event happened
in the park.  However, if the ``PP`` is attached to ``NP``,
then it was the man who was in the park, and the agent of the seeing (the dog)
might have been sitting on the balcony of an apartment overlooking the
park.


Writing Your Own Grammars
-------------------------

If you are interested in experimenting with writing CFGs, you will
find it helpful to create and edit your grammar in a text
file, say ``mygrammar.cfg``. You can then load it into |NLTK| and
parse with it as follows:

.. doctest-ignore::
    >>> grammar1 = nltk.data.load('file:mygrammar.cfg')
    >>> sent = "Mary saw Bob".split()
    >>> rd_parser = nltk.RecursiveDescentParser(grammar1)
    >>> for tree in rd_parser.nbest_parse(sent):
    ...      print tree

Make sure that you put a ``.cfg`` suffix on the filename, and that
there are no spaces in the string ``'file:mygrammar.cfg'``. If the
command ``print tree`` produces no output, this is probably because
your sentence ``sent`` is not admitted by your grammar. In this case,
call the parser with tracing set to be on: ``rd_parser =
nltk.RecursiveDescentParser(grammar1, trace=2)``. You can also check
what productions are currently in the grammar with the command ``for p
in grammar1.productions(): print p``.

When you write CFGs for parsing in |NLTK|, you cannot combine
grammatical categories with lexical items on the righthand side of the
same production. Thus, a production such as ``PP -> 'of' NP`` is disallowed. In
addition, you are not permitted to place multi-word lexical items on the
righthand side of a production. So rather than writing ``NP -> 'New
York'``, you have to resort to something like ``NP -> 'New_York'``
instead.


Recursion in Syntactic Structure
--------------------------------

A grammar is said to be :dt:`recursive` if a category occurring on the left hand
side of a production also appears on
the righthand side of a production, as illustrated in code-cfg2_.
The production ``Nom -> Adj Nom`` (where ``Nom`` is the
category of nominals) involves direct recursion on the category
``Nom``, whereas indirect recursion on ``S`` arises from the
combination of two productions, namely ``S -> NP VP`` and ``VP -> V S``.

.. pylisting:: code-cfg2
   :caption: A Recursive Context-Free Grammar

   grammar2 = nltk.parse_cfg("""
     S  -> NP VP
     NP -> Det Nom | PropN 
     Nom -> Adj Nom | N
     VP -> V Adj | V NP | V S | V NP PP
     PP -> P NP
     PropN -> 'Buster' | 'Chatterer' | 'Joe'
     Det -> 'the' | 'a'
     N -> 'bear' | 'squirrel' | 'tree' | 'fish' | 'log' 
     Adj  -> 'angry' | 'frightened' |  'little' | 'tall'
     V ->  'chased'  | 'saw' | 'said' | 'thought' | 'was' | 'put'
     P -> 'on'
     """)

To see how recursion arises from this grammar, consider the following
trees.  ex-recnominals_ involves nested nominal phrases,
while ex-recsentences_ contains nested sentences.

.. ex::
  .. _ex-recnominals:
  .. ex::
    .. tree::
     (S (NP (Det the) (Nom (Adj angry)(Nom (N bear))))
         (VP (V chased)
            (NP (Det the) (Nom (Adj frightened)(Nom (Adj little) (N squirrel))))))
  .. _ex-recsentences:
  .. ex::
    .. tree::
      (S (NP (PropN Chatterer))
         (VP (V said)
             (S (NP (PropN Buster))
                (VP (V thought)
                    (S (NP (Det the) (N tree))
                             (VP (V was)(Adj tall)))))))


We've only illustrated two levels of recursion here, but there's
no upper limit on the depth.  You can experiment with parsing
sentences that involve more deeply nested structures.
Beware that the ``RecursiveDescentParser`` is unable to handle
`left-recursive`:dt: productions of the form ``X -> X Y``; we will
return to this in sec-parsing_.

A :dt:`parser` processes input sentences according to the
productions of a grammar, and builds one or more
constituent structures that conform to the grammar.
A grammar is a declarative specification of well-formedness |mdash|
it is actually just a string, not a program.
A parser is a procedural interpretation of the grammar.
It searches through the space of trees licensed by a grammar
to find one that has the required sentence along its fringe.

.. XXX does the following read as though our audience does not consist
   of people who want to do the tasks described in this chapter?

A parser permits a grammar to be evaluated against
a collection of test sentences, helping linguists
to discover mistakes in their grammatical analysis.
A parser can serve as a model of psycholinguistic processing,
helping to explain the difficulties that humans have with processing
certain syntactic constructions.
Many natural language applications involve parsing at some point;
for example, we would expect the natural language questions
submitted to a question-answering system to undergo parsing as an initial step.

In this section we see two simple parsing algorithms,
a top-down method called recursive descent parsing,
and a bottom-up method called shift-reduce parsing.
We also see some more sophisticated algorithms,
a top-down method with bottom-up filtering called
left-corner parsing, and a dynamic programming
technique called chart parsing.

Recursive Descent Parsing 
-------------------------

The simplest kind of parser interprets a grammar as a specification
of how to break a high-level goal into several lower-level subgoals.
The top-level goal is to find an ``S``.  The ``S`` |rarr| ``NP VP``
production permits the parser to replace this goal with two subgoals:
find an ``NP``, then find a ``VP``.  Each of these subgoals can be
replaced in turn by sub-sub-goals, using productions that have ``NP``
and ``VP`` on their left-hand side.  Eventually, this expansion
process leads to subgoals such as: find the word `telescope`:lx:.  Such
subgoals can be directly compared against the input sequence, and
succeed if the next word is matched.  If there is no match the parser
must back up and try a different alternative.

The recursive descent parser builds a parse tree during the above
process.  With the initial goal (find an ``S``), the ``S`` root node
is created.  As the above process recursively expands its goals using
the productions of the grammar, the parse tree is extended downwards
(hence the name *recursive descent*).  We can see this in action using
the graphical demonstration ``nltk.app.rdparser()``.
Six stages of the execution of this parser are shown in fig-rdparser1-6_.

.. _fig-rdparser1-6:

   :scale: 50:100:35

   Six Stages of a Recursive Descent Parser: the parser begins with a
   tree consisting of the node ``S``; at each stage it consults the grammar
   to find a production that can be used to enlarge the tree; when
   a lexical production is encountered, its word is compared against the input;
   after a complete parse has been found, the parser backtracks to look for
   more parses.

During this process, the parser is often forced to choose between several
possible productions.  For example, in going from step 3 to step 4, it
tries to find productions with ``N`` on the left-hand side.  The
first of these is ``N`` |rarr| `man`:lx:.  When this does not work
it `backtracks`:idx:, and tries other ``N`` productions in order, until it
gets to ``N`` |rarr| `dog`:lx:, which matches the next word in the
input sentence.  Much later, as shown in step 5, it finds a complete
parse.  This is a tree that covers the entire sentence, without any
dangling edges.  Once a parse has been found, we can get the parser to
look for additional parses.  Again it will backtrack and explore other
choices of production in case any of them result in a parse.

NLTK provides a recursive descent parser:

    >>> rd_parser = nltk.RecursiveDescentParser(grammar1)
    >>> sent = 'Mary saw a dog'.split()
    >>> for t in rd_parser.nbest_parse(sent):
    ...     print t
    (S (NP Mary) (VP (V saw) (NP (Det a) (N dog))))

.. note::
   ``RecursiveDescentParser()`` takes an optional parameter ``trace``. 
   If ``trace`` is greater than zero, then the parser will report the steps
   that it takes as it parses a text.

Recursive descent parsing has three key shortcomings.  First,
left-recursive productions like ``NP -> NP PP`` send it
into an infinite loop.  Second, the parser wastes a lot of time
considering words and structures that do not correspond to the input
sentence.  Third, the backtracking process may discard parsed
constituents that will need to be rebuilt again later.  For example,
backtracking over ``VP -> V NP`` will discard the subtree
created for the ``NP``.  If the parser then proceeds with
``VP -> V NP PP``, then the ``NP`` subtree must be created all
over again.

Recursive descent parsing is a kind of `top-down parsing`:dt:.
Top-down parsers use a grammar to *predict* what the input will be,
before inspecting the input!  However, since the input is available to
the parser all along, it would be more sensible to consider the input
sentence from the very beginning.  This approach is called
`bottom-up parsing`:dt:, and we will see an example in the next section.

Shift-Reduce Parsing 
--------------------

A simple kind of bottom-up parser is the `shift-reduce parser`:dt:.
In common with all bottom-up parsers, a shift-reduce
parser tries to find sequences of words and phrases that correspond
to the *right hand* side of a grammar production, and replace them
with the left-hand side, until the whole sentence is reduced to
an ``S``.

.. XXX earlier section no longer talks about stacks.  Concepts of
   pushing and popping will need to be explained somewhere.

The shift-reduce parser repeatedly pushes the next input word onto a
stack (sec-back-to-the-basics_); this is the `shift`:dt: operation.
If the top *n* items on the stack match
the *n* items on the right hand side of some production,
then they are all popped off the stack, and the item on the left-hand
side of the production is pushed on the stack.  This replacement of
the top *n* items with a single item is the `reduce`:dt: operation.
This operation may only be applied to the top of the stack;
reducing items lower in the stack must be done before later items are
pushed onto the stack.  The parser finishes when all the input is
consumed and there is only one item remaining on the stack, a parse
tree with an ``S`` node as its root.
The shift-reduce parser builds a parse tree during the above process.
Each time it pops *n* items off the stack it combines them into
a partial parse tree, and pushes this back on the stack.
We can see the shift-reduce parsing algorithm in action using the
graphical demonstration ``nltk.app.srparser()``.
Six stages of the execution of this parser are shown in fig-srparser1-6_.

.. _fig-srparser1-6:
.. figure:: ../images/srparser1-6.png
   :scale: 50:100:35

   Six Stages of a Shift-Reduce Parser: the parser begins by shifting the
   first input word onto its stack; once the top items on the stack match
   the right hand side of a grammar production, they can be replaced with
   the left hand side of that production; the parser succeeds once all input
   is consumed and one ``S`` item remains on the stack.

NLTK provides ``ShiftReduceParser()``, a simple
implementation of a shift-reduce parser.  This parser does not
implement any backtracking, so it is not guaranteed to find a parse
for a text, even if one exists.  Furthermore, it will only find at
most one parse, even if more parses exist.  We can provide an
optional ``trace`` parameter that controls how verbosely the
parser reports the steps that it takes as it parses a text: 

    >>> sr_parse = nltk.ShiftReduceParser(grammar1)
    >>> sent = 'Mary saw a dog'.split()
    >>> print sr_parse.parse(sent)
      (S (NP Mary) (VP (V saw) (NP (Det a) (N dog))))

.. note:: |TRY|
   Run the above parser in tracing mode to see the sequence of shift and reduce
   operations, using ``sr_parse = nltk.ShiftReduceParser(grammar1, trace=2)``

A shift-reduce parser can reach a dead end and fail to find any parse,
even if the input sentence is well-formed according to the grammar.
When this happens, no input remains, and the stack contains items
which cannot be reduced to an ``S``.  The problem arises because
there are choices made earlier that cannot be undone by the parser
(although users of the graphical demonstration can undo their choices).
There are two kinds of choices to be made by the parser:
(a) which reduction to do when more than one is possible
(b) whether to shift or reduce when either action is possible.

A shift-reduce parser may be extended to implement policies for resolving such
conflicts.  For example, it may address shift-reduce conflicts by
shifting only when no reductions are possible, and it may address
reduce-reduce conflicts by favoring the reduction operation that removes
the most items from the stack.  (A generalization of shift-reduce
parser, a "lookahead LR parser", is commonly used in programming
language compilers.)

The advantage of shift-reduce parsers over recursive descent parsers
is that they only build structure that corresponds to the words in the
input.  Furthermore, they only build each sub-structure once,
e.g. ``NP(Det(the), N(man))`` is only built and pushed onto the stack
a single time, regardless of whether it will later be used by the
``VP -> V NP PP`` reduction or the ``NP -> NP PP`` reduction.

The Left-Corner Parser
----------------------

One of the problems with the recursive descent parser is that it
goes into an infinite loop when it encounters a left-recursive production.
This is because it applies the grammar
productions blindly, without considering the actual input sentence.
A left-corner parser is a hybrid between the bottom-up and top-down
approaches we have seen.

Grammar ``grammar1`` allows us to produce the following parse of `John saw
Mary`:lx:\ :

.. _ex-jmtree:
.. ex::
  .. tree::
   (S (NP John) 
      (VP (V saw)
         (NP Mary)))

.. XXX the following example is stale; the grammar it refers to does not
   have these productions; also the formatting with rarr is stale.

Recall that the grammar (defined in code-cfg2_) has the following productions for expanding ``NP``\ :

.. ex::
   .. _ex-r1:
   .. ex:: ``NP`` |rarr| ``dt nom``   (stale!)
   .. _ex-r2:
   .. ex:: ``NP`` |rarr| ``dt nom pp``  (stale!)
   .. _ex-r3:
   .. ex:: ``NP`` |rarr| ``propn``  (stale!)

.. XXX Following notation with DoubleRightArrow wrongly assumes
   this relation has been defined.

Suppose we ask you to first look at tree ex-jmtree_, and then decide
which of the ``NP`` productions you'd want a recursive descent parser to
apply first |mdash| obviously, ex-r3_ is the right choice! How do you
know that it would be pointless to apply ex-r1_ or ex-r2_ instead? Because
neither of these productions will derive a sequence whose first word is
`John`:lx:.  That is, we can easily tell that in a successful
parse of `John saw Mary`:lx:, the parser has to expand ``NP`` in
such a way that ``NP`` derives the sequence `John`:lx: |alpha|. More
generally, we say that a category `B`:math: is a `left-corner`:dt: of
a tree rooted in `A`:math: if  `A`:math: |DoubleRightArrow|\ *
`B`:math: |alpha|.

.. ex::
  .. tree:: <A B a>

A `left-corner parser`:dt: is a top-down parser with bottom-up filtering.
Unlike an ordinary recursive descent parser, it does not get trapped
in left recursive productions. 
Before starting its work, a left-corner parser preprocesses the
context-free grammar to build a table where each row contains two
cells, the first holding a non-terminal, and the second holding the
collection of possible left corners of that non-terminal. tab-lc_
illustrates this for the grammar from ``grammar2``.

.. table:: tab-lc

   ========  ============================
   Category  Left-Corners (pre-terminals)
   ========  ============================
   S         NP
   NP        Det, PropN
   VP        V
   PP        P
   ========  ============================

   Left-Corners in ``grammar2``

Each time a production is considered by the parser, it checks that the
next input word is compatible with at least one of the pre-terminal
categories in the left-corner table.

.. XXX explain how this effects the action of the parser, and why this solves the problem


Well-Formed Substring Tables
----------------------------

The simple parsers discussed above suffer from limitations in
both completeness and efficiency. In order to remedy these, we will
apply the algorithm design technique of `dynamic programming`:idx: to
the parsing problem.  As we saw in sec-algorithm-design_,
dynamic programming stores intermediate results and re-uses them when
appropriate, achieving significant efficiency gains. This technique
can be applied to syntactic parsing, allowing us to store
partial solutions to the parsing task and then look them up as
necessary in order to efficiently arrive at a complete solution.
This approach to parsing is known as `chart parsing`:dt:.  We introduce
the main idea in this section; see the online materials available for
this chapter for more implementation details.

Dynamic programming allows us to build the ``PP`` `in my pajamas`:lx:
just once.  The first time we build it we save it in a table, then we look it
up when we need to use it as a subconstituent of either the object ``NP`` or
the higher ``VP``. This table is known as a
`well-formed substring table`:dt:, or |WFST| for short.
(The term "substring" refers to a contiguous sequence of words within a sentence.) 
We will show how to construct the |WFST| bottom-up so as to systematically record
what syntactic constituents have been found.

Let's set our input to be the sentence in ex-marx-elephant_.  The numerically specified
spans of the |WFST| are reminiscent of Python's slice notation (sec-strings_).  Another
way to think about the data structure is shown in fig-chart-positions1_, a data
structure known as a `chart`:dt:. 

.. _fig-chart-positions1:
.. figure:: ../images/chart_positions1.png
   :scale: 25:100:100

   The Chart Data Structure: words are the edge labels of a linear graph structure.

In a |WFST|, we record the position of the words
by filling in cells in a triangular matrix:
the vertical axis will denote the start position of a substring,
while the horizontal axis will denote the end position
(thus `shot`:lx: will appear in the cell with coordinates (1, 2)).
To simplify this presentation, we will assume each word has a unique
lexical category, and we will store this (not the word) in the matrix.
So cell (1, 2) will contain the entry ``V``.
More generally, if our input string is
`a`:sub:`1`\ `a`:sub:`2` ... `a`:sub:`n`, and our grammar
contains a production of the form *A* |rarr| `a`:sub:`i`, then we add *A* to
the cell (`i`-1, `i`).

So, for every word in ``text``, we can look up in our grammar what
category it belongs to.

    >>> text = ['I', 'shot', 'an', 'elephant', 'in', 'my', 'pajamas']
    >>> groucho_grammar.productions(rhs=text[1])
    [V -> 'shot']

For our |WFST|, we create an `(n-1)`:math: |times| `(n-1)`:math: matrix
as a list of lists in Python, and initialize it
with the lexical categories of each token, in the ``init_wfst()``
function in code-wfst_.  We also define a utility function ``display()``
to pretty-print the |WFST| for us.
As expected, there is a ``V`` in cell (1, 2).

    6    .    .    .    .    .    .    N

Returning to our tabular representation, given that we have ``Det``
in cell (2, 3) for the word `an`:lx:, and ``N`` in cell (3, 4) for the
word `elephant`:lx:, what should we put into cell (2, 4) for `an elephant`:lx:?
We need to find a production of the form *A* |rarr| ``Det N``.
Consulting the grammar, we know that we can enter ``NP`` in cell (0,2).

More generally, we can enter *A* in `(i, j)`:math: if there
is a production *A* |rarr| *B* *C*, and we find
nonterminal *B* in `(i, k)`:math: and *C* in `(k, j)`:math:.
The program in code-wfst_ uses this rule to complete the |WFST|.
By setting ``trace`` to ``True`` when calling the function ``complete_wfst()``,
we see tracing output that shows the |WFST| being constructed:

    >>> wfst1 = complete_wfst(wfst0, tokens, groucho_grammar, trace=True)
    [2] Det [3]   N [4] ==> [2]  NP [4]
    [5] Det [6]   N [7] ==> [5]  NP [7]
    [1]   V [2]  NP [4] ==> [1]  VP [4]
    [4]   P [5]  NP [7] ==> [4]  PP [7]
    [0]  NP [1]  VP [4] ==> [0]   S [4]
    [1]  VP [4]  PP [7] ==> [1]  VP [7]
    [0]  NP [1]  VP [7] ==> [0]   S [7]

For example, this says that since we found ``Det`` at
``wfst[2][3]`` and ``N`` at ``wfst[3][4]``, we can add ``NP`` to
``wfst[2][4]``.

.. note::
   To help us easily retrieve productions by their right hand
   sides, we create an index for the grammar.
   This is an example of a space-time trade-off: we do a reverse lookup
   on the grammar, instead of having to check through the entire list of
   productions each time we want to look up via the right hand side.

.. _fig-chart-positions2:
.. figure:: ../images/chart_positions2.png
   :scale: 25:100:100

   The Chart Data Structure: non-terminals are represented as extra edges in the chart.

We conclude that there is a parse for the whole input string once
we have constructed an ``S`` node in cell (0, 7), showing that we
have found a sentence that covers the whole input.  The final state of
the |WFST| is depicted in fig-chart-positions2_.

Notice that we have not used any built-in parsing functions here.
We've implemented a complete, primitive chart parser from the ground up!

.. XXX distinction between recognition and parsing should be explained
   more carefully or else dropped.

|WFST|\ 's have several shortcomings.
First, as you can see, the |WFST| is not itself a parse tree, so the technique is
strictly speaking `recognizing`:dt: that a sentence is admitted by a
grammar, rather than parsing it.
Second, it requires every non-lexical grammar production to be `binary`:em:.
Although it is possible to convert an arbitrary |CFG| into this form,
we would prefer to use an approach without such a requirement.
Third, as a bottom-up approach it is potentially wasteful, being
able to propose constituents in locations that would not be licensed by
the grammar.

Finally, the |WFST| did not represent the structural ambiguity in
the sentence (i.e. the two verb phrase readings).  The ``VP``
in cell (`2,8`) was actually entered twice, once for a ``V NP``
reading, and once for a ``VP PP`` reading.  These are different
hypotheses, and the second overwrote the first (as it happens this didn't
matter since the left hand side was the same.)
Chart parsers use a slighly richer data structure and some interesting
algorithms to solve these problems (see the Further Reading section at
the end of this chapter for details).

-----------------------------------
Dependencies and Dependency Grammar
-----------------------------------

Phrase structure grammar is concerned with how words and sequences of
words `combine`:em: to form constituents. A distinct and complementary
approach, dependency grammar, focusses instead on how words
`relate`:em: to other words. Dependency is a binary asymmetric relation that
holds between a `head`:dt: and its `dependents`:dt:. 
The head of a sentence is usually taken to be the tensed verb, and every other word is
either dependent on the sentence head, or connects to it through a path of
dependencies. 

.. XXX explain concept of "head"?

A dependency representation is a labeled directed graph, where the
nodes are the lexical items and the labeled arcs represent dependency
relations from heads to dependents.  fig-depgraph0_ illustrates a
dependency graph, where arrows point from heads to their dependents.

.. _fig-depgraph0:
.. figure:: ../images/depgraph0.png
   :scale: 35

   Dependency Structure: arrows point from heads to their dependents;
   labels indicate the grammatical function of the dependent as
   subject, object or modifier. 

The arcs in fig-depgraph0_ are labeled with the grammatical
function that holds between a dependent and its head. For example,
`I`:lx: is the ``SBJ`` (subject) of `shot`:lx: (which is the head of
the whole sentence), and `in`:lx: is an ``NMOD`` (noun modifier of
`elephant`:lx:). In contrast to phrase structure grammar, therefore,
dependency grammars can be used to directly express grammatical
functions as a type of dependency.  

Here's one way of encoding a
dependency grammar in |NLTK| |mdash| note that it only captures bare
dependency information without specifying the type of dependency:

    >>> groucho_dep_grammar = nltk.parse_dependency_grammar("""
    ... 'shot' -> 'I' | 'elephant' | 'in'
    ... 'elephant' -> 'an' | 'in'
    ... 'in' -> 'pajamas'
    ... 'pajamas' -> 'my'
    ... """)
    >>> print groucho_dep_grammar
    Dependency grammar with 7 productions
      'shot' -> 'I'
      'shot' -> 'elephant'
      'shot' -> 'in'
      'elephant' -> 'an'
      'elephant' -> 'in'
      'in' -> 'pajamas'
      'pajamas' -> 'my'

A dependency graph is `projective`:dt: if, when all the words are
written in linear order, the edges can be drawn above the words
without crossing. This is equivalent to saying that a word and all its
descendents (dependents and dependents of its dependents, etc.) form a
contiguous sequence of words within the sentence. fig-depgraph0_ is
projective, and we can parse many sentences in English using a
projective dependency parser. The next example shows how
``groucho_dep_grammar`` provides an alternative approach to capturing
the attachment ambiguity that we examined earlier with phrase
structure grammar. 

    >>> pdp = nltk.ProjectiveDependencyParser(groucho_dep_grammar)
    >>> sent = 'I shot an elephant in my pajamas'.split() 
    >>> trees = pdp.parse(sent)
    >>> for tree in trees:
    ...     print tree
    (shot I (elephant an (in (pajamas my))))
    (shot I (elephant an) (in (pajamas my)))

These bracketed dependency structures can also be displayed as trees,
where dependents are shown as children of their heads.

.. _ex-depgraph1:
.. ex::
    .. tree:: (shot I (elephant (in pajamas my)))
    .. tree:: (shot I elephant (in pajamas my))

In languages with more flexible word order than English,
non-projective dependencies are more frequent.

.. give example of parsing non-projective example
.. really needs better technique for visualizing a DependencyGraph

Various criteria have been proposed for deciding what is the head *H* and
what is the dependent *D* in a construction *C*. Some of the most important
are the following:

#. *H* determines the distribution class of *C*; or alternatively, the
   external syntactic properties of *C* are due to *H*.
#. *H* determines the semantic type of *C*.
#. *H* is obligatory while *D* may be optional.
#. *H* selects *D* and determines whether it is obligatory or
   optional.
#. The morphological form of *D* is determined by *H* (e.g. agreement
   or case government).

When we say in a phrase structure grammar that the immediate
constituents of a ``PP`` are ``P`` and ``NP``, we are implicitly
appealing to the head / dependent distinction. A prepositional phrase
is a phrase whose head is a preposition; moreover, the ``NP`` is a
dependent of ``P``.  The same distinction carries over to the other
types of phrase that we have discussed. The key point to note here is
that although phrase structure grammars seem very different from
dependency grammars, they implicitly embody a recognition of
dependency relations. While CFGs are not intended to directly capture
dependencies, more recent linguistic frameworks have increasingly
adopted formalisms which combine aspects of both approaches.


Valency and the Lexicon
-----------------------

Let us take a closer look at verbs and their dependents.
The grammar in code-cfg2_ correctly generates examples like
ex-subcat1_.

.. _ex-subcat1:
.. ex::
   .. ex:: The squirrel was frightened.
   .. ex:: Chatterer saw the bear.
   .. ex:: Chatterer thought Buster was angry.
   .. ex:: Joe put the fish on the log.

.. XXX CFG productions in the DG section?

These possibilities correspond to the following productions:

.. table:: tab-subcat

    +--------------------+--------------------+
    | ``VP -> V Adj``    |  `was`:lx:         |
    +--------------------+--------------------+
    | ``VP -> V NP``     |  `saw`:lx:         |
    +--------------------+--------------------+
    | ``VP -> V S``      | `thought`:lx:      |
    +--------------------+--------------------+
    | ``VP -> V NP PP``  |  `put`:lx:         |
    +--------------------+--------------------+

    Missing Caption

.. XXX above table is missing a caption, required for formal tables

That is, `was`:lx: can occur with a following ``Adj``, `saw`:lx: can occur with a
following ``NP``, `thought`:lx: can occur with a following ``S`` and `put`:lx: can
occur with a following ``NP`` and ``PP``. The dependents ``Adj``, ``NP``, ``PP`` and
``S`` are often called :dt:`complements` of the respective verbs and there are strong
constraints on what verbs can occur with what complements. By contrast with
ex-subcat1_, the word sequences in ex-subcat2_ are ill-formed:

.. _ex-subcat2:
.. ex:: 
   .. ex:: \*The squirrel was Buster was angry.
   .. ex:: \*Chatterer saw frightened.
   .. ex:: \*Chatterer thought the bear.
   .. ex:: \*Joe put on the log.

.. note::
   With a little imagination, it is possible to
   invent contexts in which unusual combinations of verbs and
   complements are interpretable. However, we assume that the above
   examples are to be interpreted in neutral contexts.

.. XXX does the historical note matter here?  Can we just talk about
   valency without linking it to a tradition?

In the tradition of dependency grammar, the verbs in tab-subcat_ are said
to have different `valencies`:dt:. Valency restrictions are not just
applicable to verbs, but also to the other classes of heads.

.. XXX "techniques within frameworks based on PSG" overly complicated.
   This paragraph probably works just fine without this sentence.

Within frameworks based on phrase structure grammar, various
techniques have been proposed for excluding the
ungrammatical examples in ex-subcat2_. In a CFG, we need some way of constraining
grammar productions which expand ``VP`` so that verbs *only* co-occur
with their correct complements. We can do this by dividing the class of
verbs into "subcategories", each of which is associated with a
different set of complements. For example, `transitive verbs`:dt: such
as `chased`:lx: and `saw`:lx: require a following ``NP``
object complement; that is, they are `subcategorized`:dt: for ``NP``
direct objects. If we introduce a new category label for transitive verbs, namely
``TV`` (for Transitive Verb), then we can use it in the following productions:

::

     VP -> TV NP
     TV -> 'chased' | 'saw'

Now `*Joe thought the bear`:lx: is excluded since we haven't listed
`thought`:lx: as a ``TV``, but `Chatterer saw the bear`:lx: is still allowed.
tab-verbcat_ provides more examples of labels for verb subcategories.

.. table:: tab-verbcat

   ======    ====================    ========================
   Symbol    Meaning                 Example
   ======    ====================    ========================
   IV        intransitive verb       *barked*
   TV        transitive verb         *saw a man*
   DatV      dative verb             *gave a dog to a man*
   SV        sentential verb         *said that a dog barked*
   ======    ====================    ========================

   Verb Subcategories

Valency is a property of lexical items, and we will discuss it further
in chap-featgram_.

Complements are often contrasted with modifiers (or adjuncts),
although both are kinds of dependent. Prepositional phrases,
adjectives and adverbs typically function as modifiers. Unlike
complements, modifiers are optional, can often be iterated, and are
not selected for by heads in the same way as complements. For
example, the adverb `really`:lx: can be added as a modifer to all the
sentence in ex-mod_:

.. _ex-mod:
.. ex::
   .. ex:: The squirrel really was frightened.
   .. ex:: Chatterer really saw the bear.
   .. ex:: Chatterer really thought Buster was angry.
   .. ex:: Joe really put the fish on the log.

The structural ambiguity of ``PP`` attachment, which we have
illustrated in both phrase structure and dependency grammars,
corresponds semantically to an ambiguity in the scope of the modifier.


Scaling Up
----------

So far, we have only considered "toy grammars," small grammars that
illustrate the key aspects of parsing.  But there is an obvious
question as to whether the approach can be scaled up to cover
large corpora of natural languages. How hard would it be to construct
such a set of productions by hand? In general, the answer is: *very
hard*. Even if we allow ourselves to use various formal devices that
give much more succinct representations of grammar productions, it is still extremely
difficult to keep control of the complex interactions between the many
productions required to cover the major constructions of a
language. In other words, it is hard to modularize grammars so that
one portion can be developed independently of the other parts. This in
turn means that it is difficult to distribute the task of grammar
writing across a team of linguists. Another difficulty is that as the
grammar expands to cover a wider and wider range of constructions,
there is a corresponding increase in the number of analyses which are
admitted for any one sentence. In other words, ambiguity increases
with coverage.

Despite these problems, some large collaborative
projects have achieved interesting and impressive results in
developing rule-based grammars for several languages. Examples are the
Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) Pargram project,
the Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) LinGO Matrix framework,
and the Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar XTAG Project.


.. _sec-grammar-development:

-------------------
Grammar Development
-------------------

Parsing builds trees over sentences, according to a phrase
structure grammar.  Now, all the examples we gave above
only involved toy grammars containing a handful of productions.
What happens if we try to scale up this approach to deal
with realistic corpora of language?  In this section we will
see how to access treebanks, and look at the challenge of developing
broad-coverage grammars.

Treebanks and Grammars
----------------------

The ``corpus`` module defines the ``treebank`` corpus reader,
which contains a 10% sample of the Penn Treebank corpus.

    >>> from nltk.corpus import treebank
    >>> t = treebank.parsed_sents('wsj_0001.mrg')[0]
    >>> print t
    (S
      (NP-SBJ
        (NP (NNP Pierre) (NNP Vinken))
        (, ,)
        (ADJP (NP (CD 61) (NNS years)) (JJ old))
        (, ,))
      (VP
        (MD will)
        (VP
          (VB join)
          (NP (DT the) (NN board))
          (PP-CLR
            (IN as)
            (NP (DT a) (JJ nonexecutive) (NN director)))
          (NP-TMP (NNP Nov.) (CD 29))))
      (. .))


We can use this data to help develop a grammar.
For example, the program in code-sentential-complement_
uses a simple filter to find verbs that take sentential complements.
Assuming we already have a production of the form ``VP -> Vs S``,
this information enables us to identify particular verbs
that would be included in the expansion of ``Vs``.
        
.. pylisting:: code-sentential-complement
   :caption: Searching a Treebank to find Sentential Complements

   def filter(tree):
       child_nodes = [child.node for child in tree
                      if isinstance(child, nltk.Tree)]
       return  (tree.node == 'VP') and ('S' in child_nodes)

   >>> from nltk.corpus import treebank
   >>> [subtree for tree in treebank.parsed_sents()
   ...          for subtree in tree.subtrees(filter)]
    [Tree('VP', [Tree('VBN', ['named']), Tree('S', [Tree('NP-SBJ', ...]), ...]), ...]
    
The Prepositional Phrase Attachment Corpus, ``nltk.corpus.ppattach``
is another source of information about the valency of particular verbs.
Here we illustrate a technique for mining this corpus.
It finds pairs of prepositional phrases where the preposition
and noun are fixed, but where the choice of verb determines whether
the prepositional phrase is attached to the ``VP`` or to the ``NP``.

.. doctest-ignore::
    >>> entries = nltk.corpus.ppattach.attachments('training')
    >>> table = nltk.defaultdict(lambda: nltk.defaultdict(set))
    >>> for entry in entries:
    ...     key = entry.noun1 + '-' + entry.prep + '-' + entry.noun2
    ...     table[key][entry.attachment].add(entry.verb)
    ...
    >>> for key in sorted(table):
    ...     if len(table[key]) > 1:
    ...         print key, 'N:', sorted(table[key]['N']), 'V:', sorted(table[key]['V'])

Amongst the output lines of this program we find 
``offer-from-group N: ['rejected'] V: ['received']``,
which indicates that `received`:lx: expects a separate
``PP`` complement attached to the ``VP``, while `rejected`:lx: does not.
As before, we can use this information to help construct the grammar.

The |NLTK| corpus collection includes data from the PE08
Cross-Framework and Cross Domain Parser Evaluation Shared Task. 
A collection of larger grammars has been prepared for the purpose of
comparing different parsers, which can be obtained by downloading
the ``large_grammars`` package 
(e.g. ``python -m nltk.downloader large_grammars``).

The |NLTK| corpus collection also includes a sample from the *Sinica Treebank Corpus*,
consisting of 10,000 parsed sentences drawn from the
*Academia Sinica Balanced Corpus of Modern Chinese*.
Let's load and display one of the trees in this corpus.

    >>> nltk.corpus.sinica_treebank.parsed_sents()[3450].draw()               # doctest: +SKIP


.. image:: ../images/sinica-tree.png
   :scale: 60


Pernicious Ambiguity
--------------------

Unfortunately, as the coverage of
the grammar increases and the length of the input sentences grows, the
number of parse trees grows rapidly.  In fact, it grows at an
astronomical rate.

Let's explore this issue with the help of a simple example.
The word
`fish`:lx: is both a noun and a verb.  We can make up the sentence
`fish fish fish`:lx:, meaning *fish like to fish for other fish*.
(Try this with `police`:lx: if you prefer something more sensible.)
Here is a toy grammar for the "fish" sentences.

    >>> grammar = nltk.parse_cfg("""
    ... S -> NP V NP
    ... NP -> NP Sbar
    ... Sbar -> NP V 
    ... NP -> 'fish'
    ... V -> 'fish'
    ... """)

Now we can try parsing a longer sentence, `fish fish fish fish
fish`:lx:, which amongst other things, means 'fish that other fish
fish are in the habit of fishing fish themselves'. We use the |NLTK|
chart parser, which is presented later on in this chapter.  This
sentence has two readings.

    >>> tokens = ["fish"] * 5
    >>> cp = nltk.ChartParser(grammar)
    >>> for tree in cp.nbest_parse(tokens):
    ...     print tree
    (S (NP (NP fish) (Sbar (NP fish) (V fish))) (V fish) (NP fish))
    (S (NP fish) (V fish) (NP (NP fish) (Sbar (NP fish) (V fish))))

As the length of this sentence goes up (3, 5, 7, ...) we get the
following numbers of parse trees:
1; 2; 5; 14; 42; 132; 429; 1,430; 4,862; 16,796; 58,786; 208,012; ...
(These are the `Catalan numbers`:idx:, which we saw in an exercise
in chap-structured-programming_).
The last of these is for a sentence of length 23, the average length
of sentences in the  WSJ section of Penn Treebank.  For a sentence
of length 50 there would be over 10\ :superscript:`12` parses, and this
is only half the length of the Piglet sentence
(sec-dilemmas_),
which young children process effortlessly.
No practical |NLP| system could construct millions of trees for a
sentence and choose the appropriate one in the context.
It's clear that humans don't do this either!

Note that the problem is not with our choice of example. 
[Church1982CSA]_ point out that the syntactic ambiguity of ``PP``
attachment in sentences like ex-pp_ also grows in proportion to the Catalan
numbers.

.. _ex-pp:
.. ex:: Put the block in the box on the table.

So much for structural ambiguity; what about lexical ambiguity?
As soon as we try to construct a broad-coverage grammar, we
are forced to make lexical entries highly ambiguous for their part of
speech.  In a toy grammar, `a`:lx: is only a determiner, `dog`:lx: is
only a noun, and `runs`:lx: is only a verb.  However, in a
broad-coverage grammar, `a` is also a noun (e.g. `part a`:lx:),
`dog`:lx: is also a verb (meaning to follow closely), and `runs`:lx:
is also a noun (e.g. `ski runs`:lx:).  In fact, all words can be
referred to by name: e.g. `the verb 'ate' is spelled with three
letters`:lx:; in speech we do not need to supply quotation marks.
Furthermore, it is possible to *verb* most nouns.  Thus a parser for a
broad-coverage grammar will be overwhelmed with ambiguity.  Even
complete gibberish will often have a reading, e.g. `the a are of
I`:lx:.  As [Abney1996SML]_ has pointed out, this is not word salad but a
grammatical noun phrase, in which `are`:lx: is a noun meaning a
hundredth of a hectare (or 100 sq m), and `a`:lx: and `I`:lx: are
nouns designating coordinates, as shown in fig-are_.

.. _fig-are:
.. figure:: ../images/are.png
   :scale: 20

   "The a are of I": a schematic drawing of 27 paddocks, each being
   one "are" in size, and each identified using coordinates;
   the top left cell is the `a`:em: "are" of column `I`:em: (after Abney).

|nopar|
Even though this phrase is unlikely, it is still grammatical and a
a broad-coverage parser should be able to construct a parse tree
for it.  Similarly, sentences that seem to be
unambiguous, such as `John saw Mary`:lx:, turn out to have other
readings we would not have anticipated  (as Abney explains).  This
ambiguity is unavoidable, and leads to horrendous inefficiency in
parsing seemingly innocuous sentences. 
The solution to these problems is provided by
`probabilistic parsing`:em:, which allows us to `rank`:em:
the parses of an ambiguous sentence on the basis of evidence from corpora.

Weighted Grammar
----------------

.. TODO: mention interest in having weights is because they can be learned.
   Without this it is mysterious why we would want to bother.
   Technical aspects follow, but this is important motivation (Steven)

As we have just seen, dealing with ambiguity
is a key challenge in developing broad coverage parsers.
Chart parsers improve the efficiency of computing multiple
parses of the same sentences, but they are still overwhelmed by
the sheer number of possible parses.  Weighted grammars and
probabilistic parsing algorithms have provided an effective
solution to these problems.

Before looking at these, we need to understand why the notion of
grammaticality could be `gradient`:em:.  Considering the verb `give`:lx:.
This verb requires both a direct object (the thing being given)
and an indirect object (the recipient).
These complements can be given in either order, as
illustrated in ex-dative_.  In the "prepositional dative" form in
ex-dative-prepositional_, the direct object appears first, followed
by a prepositional phrase containing the indirect object.
 
.. _ex-dative:
.. ex::
   .. _ex-dative-prepositional:
   .. ex::
      Kim gave a bone to the dog
   .. _ex-dative-double-object:
   .. ex::
      Kim gave the dog a bone

In the "double object" form in ex-dative-double-object_,
the indirect object appears first, followed by the direct object.
In the above case, either order is acceptable.  However, if
the indirect object is a pronoun, there is a strong preference for
the double object construction:

.. ex::
   .. ex::
      *Kim gives the heebie-jeebies to me (*prepositional dative*)
   .. ex::
      Kim gives me the heebie-jeebies (*double object*)

Using the Penn Treebank sample, we can examine all instances of
prepositional dative and double object constructions involving
`give`:lx:, as shown in code-give_.

.. pylisting:: code-give
   :caption: Usage of Give and Gave in the Penn Treebank sample

   def give(t):
       return t.node == 'VP' and len(t) > 2 and t[1].node == 'NP'\
              and (t[2].node == 'PP-DTV' or t[2].node == 'NP')\
              and ('give' in t[0].leaves() or 'gave' in t[0].leaves())
   def sent(t):
       return ' '.join(token for token in t.leaves() if token[0] not in '*-0')
   def print_node(t, width):
           output = "%s %s: %s / %s: %s" %\
               (sent(t[0]), t[1].node, sent(t[1]), t[2].node, sent(t[2]))
           if len(output) > width:
               output = output[:width] + "..."
           print output

   >>> for tree in nltk.corpus.treebank.parsed_sents():
   ...     for t in tree.subtrees(give):
   ...         print_node(t, 72)

   gave NP: Mr. Thomas / NP: only a `` qualified '' rating , rather than ``...
   give NP: the president / NP: line-item veto power

We can observe a strong tendency for the shortest complement to appear
first.  However, this does not account for a form like
``give NP: federal judges / NP: a raise``, where animacy may
play a role.  In fact there turn out to be a large number of contributing
factors, as surveyed by [Bresnan2006GG]_.
Such preferences can be represented in a weighted grammar.

A `probabilistic context free grammar`:dt: (or *PCFG*) is a context free
grammar that associates a probability with each of its productions.
It generates the same set of parses for a text that the corresponding
context free grammar does, and assigns a probability to each parse.
The probability of a parse generated by a PCFG is simply the product
of the probabilities of the productions used to generate it.

The simplest way to define a PCFG is to load it from a specially
formatted string consisting of a sequence of weighted productions,
where weights appear in brackets, as shown in code-pcfg1_.

.. pylisting:: code-pcfg1
   :caption: Defining a Probabilistic Context Free Grammar (PCFG)

   grammar = nltk.parse_pcfg("""
       S    -> NP VP              [1.0]
       VP   -> TV NP              [0.4]
       VP   -> IV                 [0.3]
       VP   -> DatV NP NP         [0.3]
       TV   -> 'saw'              [1.0]
       IV   -> 'ate'              [1.0]
       DatV -> 'gave'             [1.0]
       NP   -> 'telescopes'       [0.8]
       NP   -> 'Jack'             [0.2]
       """)
   >>> print grammar
   Grammar with 9 productions (start state = S)
       S -> NP VP [1.0]
       VP -> TV NP [0.4]
       VP -> IV [0.3]
       VP -> DatV NP NP [0.3]
       TV -> 'saw' [1.0]
       IV -> 'ate' [1.0]
       DatV -> 'gave' [1.0]
       NP -> 'telescopes' [0.8]
       NP -> 'Jack' [0.2]
       

It is sometimes convenient to combine multiple productions into a single line,
e.g. ``VP -> TV NP [0.4] | IV [0.3] | DatV NP NP [0.3]``.
In order to ensure that the trees generated by the grammar form a
probability distribution, PCFG grammars impose the constraint
that all productions with a given left-hand side must have
probabilities that sum to one.
The grammar in code-pcfg1_ obeys this constraint: for ``S``,
there is only one production, with a probability of 1.0; for ``VP``,
0.4+0.3+0.3=1.0; and for ``NP``, 0.8+0.2=1.0.
The parse tree returned by ``parse()`` includes probabilities:

    >>> viterbi_parser = nltk.ViterbiParser(grammar)
    >>> print viterbi_parser.parse(['Jack', 'saw', 'telescopes'])
    (S (NP Jack) (VP (TV saw) (NP telescopes))) (p=0.064)

Now that parse trees are assigned probabilities, it no longer matters
that there may be a huge number of possible parses for a given sentence.
A parser will be responsible for finding the most likely parses.

Summary
-------

* Sentences have internal organization
  that can be represented using a tree. Notable features of constituent
  structure are: recursion, heads, complements and modifiers.

* A grammar is a compact characterization of a potentially infinite set of sentences;
  we say that a tree is well-formed according to a grammar, or that a grammar licenses a tree.

* A grammar is a formal model for describing whether a given phrase can be
  assigned a particular constituent or dependency structure.

* Given a set of syntactic categories, a context-free grammar
  uses a set of productions to say how a phrase of some category *A* can
  be analyzed into a sequence of smaller parts |alpha|\ :sub:`1`
  ... |alpha|\ :sub:`n`.

* A dependency grammar uses productions to specify what the dependents
  are of a given lexical head.

* Syntactic ambiguity arises when one sentence has more than one syntactic analysis
  (e.g. prepositional phrase attachment ambiguity).

* A parser is a procedure for finding one or more trees corresponding to a grammatically
  well-formed sentence.

* A simple top-down parser is the recursive descent parser, which recursively
  expands the start symbol (usually ``S``) with the help of the grammar
  productions, and tries to match the input sentence.  This parser cannot
  handle left-recursive productions (e.g., productions such as ``NP -> NP PP``).
  It is inefficient in the way it blindly expands
  categories without checking whether they are compatible with the input string, and
  in repeatedly expanding the same non-terminals and discarding the results.

* A simple bottom-up parser is the shift-reduce parser, which shifts input onto
  a stack and tries to match the items at the top of the stack with the right
  hand side of grammar productions.  This parser is not guaranteed to find
  a valid parse for the input even if one exists, and builds substructure without
  checking whether it is globally consistent with the grammar.

.. * It is difficult to develop a broad-coverage grammar ...

general introduction to linguistics, while [Radford1988TG]_ provides a
gentle introduction to transformational grammar, and can be
recommended for its coverage of transformational approaches to
unbounded dependency constructions.  The most widely used
term in linguistics for formal grammar is `generative grammar`:dt:,
though it has nothing to do with generation [Chomsky1965]_.

[BurtonRoberts1997AS]_ is practically oriented textbook on how to
analyze constituency in English, with extensive exemplification and
exercises. [Huddleston2002CGE]_ provides an up-to-date and comprehensive analysis of
syntactic phenomena in English.

Chapter 12 of [JurafskyMartin2008]_ covers formal grammars of English;
Sections 13.1-3 cover simple parsing algorithms and techniques
for dealing with ambiguity;
Chapter 14 covers statistical parsing;
Chapter 16 covers the Chomsky hierarchy and the formal complexity
of natural language. 
[Levin1993]_ has categorized English verbs into fine-grained classes,
according to their syntactic properties.

There are several ongoing efforts to build large-scale rule-based grammars,
e.g. the LFG Pargram project ``http://www2.parc.com/istl/groups/nltt/pargram/``,
the HPSG LinGO Matrix framework ``http://www.delph-in.net/matrix/``
and the XTAG Project ``http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~xtag/``.

Exercises
---------

#. |easy| Can you come up with grammatical sentences that have probably never
   been uttered before?  (Take turns with a partner.)  What does this tell you
   about human language?

#. |easy| Recall Strunk and White's prohibition against sentence-initial
   `however`:lx: used to mean "although".
   Do a web search for `however`:lx: used at the start of the sentence.
   How widely used is this construction?

#. |easy| Consider the sentence `Kim arrived or Dana left and everyone cheered`.
   Write down the parenthesized forms to show the relative scope of `and`:lx:
   and `or`:lx:.  Generate tree structures corresponding to both of these interpretations.

#. |easy| The ``Tree`` class implements a variety of other useful methods.
   See the ``Tree`` help documentation for more details, i.e. import
   the Tree class and then type ``help(Tree)``.

#. |easy| In this exercise you will manually construct some parse trees.

   a) Write code to produce two trees, one for each reading of the phrase
      `old men and women`:lx:

   #) Encode any of the trees presented in this chapter as a labeled
      bracketing and use ``nltk.Tree()`` to check that it is well-formed.
      Now use ``draw()`` to display the tree.

   #) As in (a) above, draw a tree for `The woman saw a man last Thursday`:lx:.

#. |easy| Write a recursive function to traverse a tree and return the
   depth of the tree, such that a tree with a single node would have
   depth zero.  (Hint: the depth of a subtree is the maximum depth
   of its children, plus one.)

#. |easy| Analyze the A.A. Milne sentence about Piglet, by underlining all
   of the sentences it contains then replacing these with ``S``
   (e.g. the first sentence becomes ``S`` `when`:lx` ``S``).
   Draw a tree structure for this "compressed" sentence.  What are
   the main syntactic constructions used for building such a long
   sentence?

#. |easy| In the recursive descent parser demo, experiment with changing the
   sentence to be parsed by selecting *Edit Text* in the *Edit* menu.

#. |easy| Can the grammar in ``grammar1`` be used to describe sentences that are
   more than 20 words in length?

#. |easy| Use the graphical chart-parser interface to experiment with
   different rule invocation strategies. Come up with your own strategy
   that you can execute manually using the graphical interface. Describe
   the steps, and report any efficiency improvements it has (e.g. in terms
   of the size of the resulting chart). Do these improvements depend on
   the structure of the grammar? What do you think of the prospects for
   significant performance boosts from cleverer rule invocation
   strategies?

#. |easy| With pen and paper, manually trace the execution of a recursive descent
   parser and a shift-reduce parser, for a CFG you have already seen, or one
   of your own devising.

#. |easy| We have seen that a chart parser adds but never removes edges
   from a chart.  Why?

#. |easy| Consider the sequence of words:
   `Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo`:lx:.
   This is a grammatically correct sentence, as explained at
   ``http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo.``
   Consider the tree diagram presented on this Wikipedia page, and write down a suitable
   grammar.  Normalize case to lowercase, to simulate the problem that a listener has when hearing
   this sentence.  Can you find other parses for this sentence?  
   How does the number of parse trees grow as the sentence gets longer?
   (More examples of these sentences can be found at ``http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_homophonous_phrases``).

#. |soso| You can modify the grammar in the recursive descent parser demo
   by selecting *Edit Grammar*  in the *Edit* menu. Change
   the first expansion production, namely ``NP -> Det N PP``, to ``NP -> NP
   PP``. Using the *Step* button, try to build a parse tree. What happens?

#. |soso| Extend the grammar in ``grammar2`` with productions that expand prepositions as
   intransitive, transitive and requiring a ``PP``
   complement. Based on these productions, use the method of the
   preceding exercise to draw a tree for the sentence `Lee ran away home`:lx:\.

#. |soso| Pick some common verbs and complete the following tasks:

   a) Write a program to find those verbs in the Prepositional Phrase Attachment Corpus
      ``nltk.corpus.ppattach``.  Find any cases where the same verb
      exhibits two different attachments, but where the first noun,
      or second noun, or preposition, stay unchanged (as we saw in
      our discussion of syntactic ambiguity in sec-whats-the-use-of-syntax_).

   b) Devise CFG grammar productions to cover some of these cases.

#. |soso| Write a program to compare the efficiency of a top-down chart parser
   compared with a recursive descent parser (sec-parsing_).
   Use the same grammar and input sentences for both.  Compare their performance
   using the ``timeit`` module (see sec-algorithm-design_ for an example of
   how to do this).

#. |soso| Compare the performance of the top-down, bottom-up, and left-corner
   parsers using the same grammar and three grammatical test
   sentences. Use ``timeit`` to log the amount of time each
   parser takes on the same sentence.  Write a function that runs all
   three parsers on all three sentences, and prints a 3-by-3 grid of
   times, as well as row and column totals. Discuss your findings.

#. |soso| Read up on "garden path" sentences.  How might the computational
   work of a parser relate to the difficulty humans have with
   processing these sentences?
   ``http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_path_sentence``

#. |soso| To compare multiple trees in a single window, we can use the
   ``draw_trees()`` method.  Define some trees and try it out:

    >>> from nltk.draw.tree import draw_trees
    >>> draw_trees(tree1, tree2, tree3)                    # doctest: +SKIP

#. |soso| Using tree positions, list the subjects of the first 100
   sentences in the Penn treebank; to make the results easier to view,
   limit the extracted subjects to subtrees whose height is 2.

#. |soso| Inspect the Prepositional Phrase Attachment Corpus
   and try to suggest some factors that influence ``PP`` attachment.

#. |soso| In this section we claimed that there are linguistic regularities
   that cannot be described simply in terms of n-grams.
   Consider the following sentence, particularly the position of the phrase
   `in his turn`:lx:.  Does this illustrate a problem for an approach based
   on n-grams?

     `What was more, the in his turn somewhat youngish Nikolay Parfenovich
     also turned out to be the only person in the entire world to acquire a
     sincere liking to our "discriminated-against" public procurator.`
     (Dostoevsky: The Brothers Karamazov)

#. |soso| Write a recursive function that produces a nested bracketing for
   a tree, leaving out the leaf nodes, and displaying the non-terminal
   labels after their subtrees.  So the above example about Pierre
   Vinken would produce:
   ``[[[NNP NNP]NP , [ADJP [CD NNS]NP JJ]ADJP ,]NP-SBJ MD [VB [DT NN]NP [IN [DT JJ NN]NP]PP-CLR [NNP CD]NP-TMP]VP .]S``
   Consecutive categories should be separated by space.

#. |soso| Download several electronic books from Project Gutenberg.
   Write a program to scan these texts for any extremely long sentences.
   What is the longest sentence you can find?  What syntactic construction(s)
   are responsible for such long sentences?

#. |soso| Modify the functions ``init_wfst()`` and ``complete_wfst()`` so
   that the contents of each cell in the |WFST| is a set of
   non-terminal symbols rather than a single non-terminal.

#. |soso| Consider the algorithm in code-wfst_.  Can you explain why
   parsing context-free grammar is proportional to `n`:sup:`3`\ , where *n*
   is the length of the input sentence.

#. |soso| Process each tree of the Treebank corpus sample ``nltk.corpus.treebank``
   and extract the productions with the help of ``Tree.productions()``.  Discard
   the productions that occur only once.  Productions with the same left hand side,
   and similar right hand sides can be collapsed, resulting in an equivalent but
   more compact set of rules.  Write code to output a compact grammar. 

#. |hard| One common way of defining the subject of a sentence ``S`` in
   English is as *the noun phrase that is the child of* ``S`` *and
   the sibling of* ``VP``.   Write a function that takes the tree for
   a sentence and returns the subtree corresponding to the subject of the
   sentence.  What should it do if the root node of the tree passed to
   this function is not ``S``, or it lacks a subject?

#. |hard| Write a function that takes a grammar (such as the one defined in
   code-cfg1_) and returns a random sentence generated by the grammar.
   (Use ``grammar.start()`` to find the start symbol of the grammar;
   ``grammar.productions(lhs)`` to get the list of productions from the grammar
   that have the specified left-hand side; and ``production.rhs()`` to get
   the right-hand side of a production.)

#. |hard| Implement a version of the shift-reduce parser using backtracking,
   so that it finds all possible parses for a sentence, what might be called
   a "recursive ascent parser."  Consult the Wikipedia entry for backtracking
   at ``http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking``

#. |hard|
   As we saw in chap-chunk_, it is possible 
   to collapse chunks down to their chunk label.  When we do this
   for sentences involving the word `gave`:lx:, we find patterns
   such as the following::

      gave NP
      gave up NP in NP
      gave NP up
      gave NP NP
      gave NP to NP

   a) Use this method to study the complementation patterns of a verb
      of interest, and write suitable grammar productions.  (This task
      is sometimes called `lexical acquisition`:dt:.)

   b) Identify some English verbs that are near-synonyms, such as the
      :lx:`dumped/filled/loaded` example from earlier in this chapter.
      Use the chunking method to study the complementation patterns of
      these verbs.  Create a grammar to cover these cases.  Can the verbs
      be freely substituted for each other, or are their constraints?
      Discuss your findings.

#. |hard| Develop a left-corner parser based on the
   recursive descent parser, and inheriting from ``ParseI``.

#. |hard| Extend NLTK's shift-reduce parser to incorporate backtracking, so
   that it is guaranteed to find all parses that exist (i.e. it is `complete`:dt:).

#. |hard| Modify the functions ``init_wfst()`` and ``complete_wfst()`` so
   that when a non-terminal symbol is added to a cell in the |WFST|, it includes
   a record of the cells from which it was derived. Implement a
   function that will convert a |WFST| in this form to a parse tree.

   example in chapter 1.1); (possible extension: callback function for Tree.subtrees())
