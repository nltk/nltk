=================================
1. Language Processing and Python
=================================

It is easy to get our hands on millions of words of text.
What can we do with it, assuming we can write some simple programs?
In this chapter we'll address the following questions:

#. What can we achieve by combining simple programming techniques with large quantities of text?
#. How can we automatically extract key words and phrases that sum up the style and content of a text?
#. What tools and techniques does the Python programming language provide for such work?
#. What are some of the interesting challenges of natural language processing?

This chapter is divided into sections that skip between two quite
different styles.  In the "computing with language" sections we will
take on some linguistically motivated programming tasks without necessarily
explaining how they work.  In the "closer look at Python" sections we
will systematically review key programming concepts.  We'll flag the two styles in the section titles,
but later chapters will mix both styles without being so up-front about it.
We hope this style of introduction gives you an
authentic taste of what will come later, while covering a range of
elementary concepts in linguistics and computer science.
If you have basic familiarity with both areas, you can skip to
sec-automatic-natural-language-understanding_;
we will repeat any important points in later chapters, and if you miss anything
you can easily consult the online reference material at |NLTK-URL|.
If the material is completely new to you, this chapter will raise
more questions than it answers, questions that are addressed in
the rest of this book.

.. _sec-computing-with-language-texts-and-words:

----------------------------------------
Computing with Language: Texts and Words
----------------------------------------

We're all very familiar with text, since we read and write it every day.
Here we will treat text as `raw data`:em: for the programs we write,
programs that manipulate and analyze it in a variety of interesting ways.
But before we can do this, we have to get started with the Python interpreter.

Getting Started with Python
---------------------------

One of the friendly things about Python is that it allows you
to type directly into the interactive `interpreter`:dt: |mdash|
the program that will be running your Python programs.
You can access the Python interpreter using a simple graphical interface
called the Interactive DeveLopment Environment (|IDLE|).
On a Mac you can find this under *Applications*\ |rarr|\ *MacPython*,
and on Windows under *All Programs*\ |rarr|\ *Python*.
Under Unix you can run Python from the shell by typing ``idle``
(if this is not installed, try typing ``python``).
The interpreter will print a blurb about your Python version;
simply check that you are running Python 2.4 or 2.5 (here it is 2.5.1):

.. doctest-ignore::
    Python 2.5.1 (r251:54863, Apr 15 2008, 22:57:26) 
    [GCC 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5465)] on darwin
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>>

.. note::
   If you are unable to run the Python interpreter, you probably don't
   have Python installed correctly.  Please visit |PYTHON-URL| for
   detailed instructions.

The ``>>>`` prompt indicates that the Python interpreter is now waiting
for input.  When copying examples from this book, don't type
the "``>>>``" yourself.  Now, let's begin by using Python as a calculator:

    >>> 1 + 5 * 2 - 3
    8
    >>>

Once the interpreter has finished calculating the answer and displaying it, the
prompt reappears. This means the Python interpreter is waiting for another instruction.

.. note:: |TRY|
   Enter a few more expressions of your own. You can use asterisk (``*``)
   for multiplication and slash (``/``) for division, and parentheses for
   bracketing expressions.  Note that division doesn't always behave
   as you might expect |mdash| it does integer division (with rounding
   of fractions downwards) when you type
   ``1/3`` and "floating point" (or decimal) division when you type ``1.0/3.0``.
   In order to get the expected behavior of division (standard in Python 3.0),
   you need to type: ``from __future__ import division``

.. XXX The following example currently wraps over a page boundary, which
   makes it difficult to read, esp since you can't see where the "^" is
   pointing.

The preceding examples demonstrate how you can work interactively with the
Python interpreter, experimenting with various expressions in the language
to see what they do.
Now let's try a nonsensical expression to see how the interpreter handles it:

    >>> 1 +
      File "<stdin>", line 1 
        1 +
          ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    >>>

This produced a `syntax error`:dt:.  In Python, it doesn't make sense
to end an instruction with a plus sign. The Python interpreter
indicates the line where the problem occurred (line 1 of ``<stdin>``,
which stands for "standard input").

Now that we can use the Python interpreter, we're ready to start working
with language data.

Getting Started with NLTK
-------------------------

Before going further you should install |NLTK|\ , downloadable for free from |NLTK-URL|.
Follow the instructions there to download the version required for your platform.

Once you've installed |NLTK|, start up the Python interpreter as
before, and install the data required for the book by
typing the following two commands at the Python prompt, then selecting
the ``book`` collection as shown in fig-nltk-downloader_.
   
.. doctest-ignore::
    >>> import nltk
    >>> nltk.download()
   
.. _fig-nltk-downloader:
.. figure:: ../images/nltk-downloader.png
   :scale: 100:100:100

   Downloading the NLTK Book Collection: browse the available packages
   using ``nltk.download()``.  The **Collections** tab on the downloader
   shows how the packages are grouped into sets, and you should select the line labeled
   **book** to obtain all
   data required for the examples and exercises in this book.  It consists
   of about 30 compressed files requiring about 100Mb disk space.
   The full collection of data (i.e., **all** in the downloader) is
   about five times this size (at the time 
   of writing) and continues to expand.

Once the data is downloaded to your machine, you can load some of it
using the Python interpreter.
The first step is to type a special command at the
Python prompt which tells the interpreter to load some texts for us to
explore: ``from nltk.book import *``.
This says "from NLTK's ``book`` module, load
all items."  The ``book`` module contains all the data you will need
as you read this chapter.  After printing a welcome message, it loads
the text of several books (this will take a few seconds).  Here's the
command again, together with the output that
you will see.  Take care to get spelling and punctuation right, and
remember that you don't type the ``>>>``.

    >>> from nltk.book import *
    *** Introductory Examples for the NLTK Book ***
    Loading text1, ..., text9 and sent1, ..., sent9
    Type the name of the text or sentence to view it.
    Type: 'texts()' or 'sents()' to list the materials.
    text1: Moby Dick by Herman Melville 1851
    text2: Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen 1811
    text3: The Book of Genesis
    text4: Inaugural Address Corpus
    text5: Chat Corpus
    text6: Monty Python and the Holy Grail
    text7: Wall Street Journal
    text8: Personals Corpus
    text9: The Man Who Was Thursday by G . K . Chesterton 1908
    >>>

Any time we want to find out about these texts, we just have
to enter their names at the Python prompt:

    >>> text1
    <Text: Moby Dick by Herman Melville 1851>
    >>> text2
    <Text: Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen 1811>
    >>>

Now that we can use the Python interpreter, and have some data to work with,
we're ready to get started.

Searching Text
--------------

There are many ways to examine the context of a text apart from
simply reading it.  A concordance view shows us every occurrence of a given word, together
with some context.  Here we look up the word `monstrous`:lx: in *Moby
Dick* by entering ``text1`` followed by a period, then the term
``concordance``, and then placing ``"monstrous"`` in parentheses:

    >>> text1.concordance("monstrous")
    Building index...
    Displaying 11 of 11 matches:
    ong the former , one was of a most monstrous size . ... This came towards us ,
    ON OF THE PSALMS . " Touching that monstrous bulk of the whale or ork we have r
    ll over with a heathenish array of monstrous clubs and spears . Some were thick

    >>>

.. note:: |TRY|
   Try searching for other words; to save re-typing, you might be able to
   use up-arrow, Ctrl-up-arrow or Alt-p to access the previous command and modify the word being searched.
   You can also try searches on some of the other texts we have included.
   For example, search *Sense and Sensibility* for the word
   `affection`:lx:, using ``text2.concordance("affection")``.  Search the book of Genesis
   to find out how long some people lived, using
   ``text3.concordance("lived")``.  You could look at ``text4``, the
   *Inaugural Address Corpus*, to see examples of English going
   back to 1789, and search for words like `nation`:lx:, `terror`:lx:, `god`:lx:
   to see how these words have been used differently over time.
   We've also included ``text5``, the *NPS Chat Corpus*: search this for
   unconventional words like `im`:lx:, `ur`:lx:, `lol`:lx:.
   (Note that this corpus is uncensored!)

Once you've spent a little while examining these texts, we hope you have a new
sense of the richness and diversity of language.  In the next chapter
you will learn how to access a broader range of text, including text in
languages other than English.

A concordance permits us to see words in context.  For example, we saw that
`monstrous`:lx: occurred in contexts such as `the ___ pictures`:lx:
and `the ___ size`:lx: .  What other words appear in a similar range
of contexts?  We can find out
by appending the term ``similar`` to the name of the text in
question, then inserting the relevant word in parentheses:

    >>> text1.similar("monstrous")
    Building word-context index...
    subtly impalpable pitiable curious imperial perilous trustworthy
    abundant untoward singular lamentable few maddens horrible loving lazy
    mystifying christian exasperate puzzled
    >>> text2.similar("monstrous")
    Building word-context index...
    very exceedingly so heartily a great good amazingly as sweet
    remarkably extremely vast
    >>>

Observe that we get different results for different texts.  
Austen uses this word quite differently from Melville; for her, `monstrous`:lx: has
positive connotations, and sometimes functions as an intensifier like the word
`very`:lx:.  

The term ``common_contexts`` allows us to examine just the
contexts that are shared by two or more words, such as `monstrous`:lx:
and `very`:lx:. We have to enclose these words by square brackets as
well as parentheses, and separate them with a comma:

    >>> text2.common_contexts(["monstrous", "very"])
    be_glad am_glad a_pretty is_pretty a_lucky
    >>>

.. note:: |TRY|
   Pick another pair of words and compare their usage in two different texts, using
   the ``similar()`` and ``common_contexts()`` functions.

It is one thing to automatically detect that a particular word occurs in a text,
and to display some words that appear in the same context.  However, we can also determine
the *location* of a word in the text: how many words from the beginning it appears.
This positional information can be displayed using a `dispersion plot`:dt:.
Each stripe represents an instance
of a word, and each row represents the entire text.  In fig-inaugural_ we
see some striking patterns of word usage over the last 220 years
(in an artificial text constructed by joining
the texts of the Inaugural Address Corpus end-to-end). 
You can produce this plot as shown below.
You might like to try more words (e.g., `liberty`:lx:, `constitution`:lx:),
and different texts.  Can you predict the
dispersion of a word before you view it?  As before, take
care to get the quotes, commas, brackets and parentheses exactly right.

.. doctest-ignore::
    >>> text4.dispersion_plot(["citizens", "democracy", "freedom", "duties", "America"])
    >>>

.. _fig-inaugural:
.. figure:: ../images/inaugural.png
   :scale: 90:90:90

   Lexical Dispersion Plot for Words in U.S. Presidential Inaugural Addresses:
   This can be used to investigate changes in language use over time.

.. note:: |IMPORTANT|
   You need to have Python's NumPy and Matplotlib packages installed
   in order to produce the graphical plots used in this book.
   Please see |NLTK-URL| for installation instructions.

Now, just for fun, let's try generating some random text in the various
styles we have just seen.  To do this, we type the name of the text
followed by the term ``generate``. (We need to include the
parentheses, but there's nothing that goes between them.)

    >>> text3.generate()
    In the beginning of his brother is a hairy man , whose top may reach
    unto heaven ; and ye shall sow the land of Egypt there was no bread in
    all that he was taken out of the month , upon the earth . So shall thy
    wages be ? And they made their father ; and Isaac was old , and kissed
    him : and Laban with his cattle in the midst of the hands of Esau thy
    first born , and Phichol the chief butler unto his son Isaac , she
    >>>

Note that the first time you run this command, it is slow because it gathers statistics
about word sequences.  Each time you run it, you will get different output text.
Now try generating random text in the style of an inaugural address or an
Internet chat room.  Although the text is random, it re-uses common words and
phrases from the source text and gives us a sense of its style and content.
(What is lacking in this randomly generated text?)

.. note::
   When ``generate`` produces its output, punctuation is split off
   from the preceding word.  While this is not correct formatting
   for English text, we do it to make clear that words and
   punctuation are independent of one another. You will learn
   more about this in chap-words_.

Counting Vocabulary
-------------------

The most obvious fact about texts that emerges from the preceding examples is that
they differ in the vocabulary they use.  In this section we will see how to use the
computer to count the words in a text in a variety of useful ways.
As before, you will jump right in and experiment with
the Python interpreter, even though you may not have studied Python systematically
yet.  Test your understanding by modifying the examples, and trying the
exercises at the end of the chapter.

Let's begin by finding out the length of a text from start to finish,
in terms of the words and punctuation symbols that appear.  We use the
term ``len`` to get the length of something, which we'll apply here to the
book of Genesis:

    >>> len(text3)
    44764
    >>>

So Genesis has 44,764 words and punctuation symbols, or "tokens."
A `token`:dt: is the technical name for a sequence of characters
|mdash| such as ``hairy``, ``his``, or ``:)`` |mdash| that we want to treat as a
group. When we count the number of tokens in a text, say, the phrase
`to be or not to be`:lx:, we are counting occurrences of these
sequences. Thus, in our example phrase there are two occurrences of `to`:lx:,
two of `be`:lx:, and one each of `or`:lx: and `not`:lx:. But there are
only four distinct vocabulary items in this phrase.
How many distinct words does the book of Genesis contain?
To work this out in Python, we have to pose the question slightly
differently.  The vocabulary of a text is just the *set* of tokens
that it uses, since in a set, all duplicates are collapsed
together. In Python we can obtain the vocabulary items of ``text3`` with the
command: ``set(text3)``.  When you do this, many screens of words will
fly past.  Now try the following: 

    >>> sorted(set(text3)) # [_sorted-set]
    ['!', "'", '(', ')', ',', ',)', '.', '.)', ':', ';', ';)', '?', '?)',
    'A', 'Abel', 'Abelmizraim', 'Abidah', 'Abide', 'Abimael', 'Abimelech',
    'Abr', 'Abrah', 'Abraham', 'Abram', 'Accad', 'Achbor', 'Adah', ...]
    >>> len(set(text3)) # [_len-set]
    2789
    >>>

By wrapping ``sorted()`` around the Python expression ``set(text3)``
sorted-set_,  we obtain a sorted list of vocabulary items, beginning
with various punctuation symbols and continuing with words starting with `A`:lx:.  All
capitalized words precede lowercase words.
We discover the size of the vocabulary indirectly, by asking
for the number of items in the set, and again we can use ``len`` to
obtain this number len-set_.  Although it has 44,764 tokens, this book
has only 2,789 distinct words, or "word types."
A `word type`:dt: is the form or spelling of the word independently of its
specific occurrences in a text |mdash| that is, the
word considered as a unique item of vocabulary.  Our count of 2,789 items
will include punctuation symbols, so we will generally call these
unique items `types`:dt: instead of word types. 

Now, let's calculate a measure of the lexical
richness of the text.  The next example shows us that each word is used 16 times on average
(we need to make sure Python uses floating point division):

    >>> from __future__ import division
    >>> len(text3) / len(set(text3))
    16.050197203298673
    >>>

Next, let's focus on particular words.  We can count how often a word occurs
in a text, and compute what percentage of the text is taken up by a specific word:

    >>> text3.count("smote")
    5
    >>> 100 * text4.count('a') / len(text4)
    1.4643016433938312
    >>>

.. note:: |TRY|
   How many times does the word `lol`:lx: appear in ``text5``?
   How much is this as a percentage of the total number of words
   in this text? 

You may want to repeat such calculations on several texts,
but it is tedious to keep retyping the formula.  Instead,
you can come up with your own name for a task, like
"lexical_diversity" or "percentage", and associate it with a block of code.
Now you only have to type a short
name instead of one or more complete lines of Python code, and
you can re-use it as often as we like. The block of code that does a
task for us is called a `function`:dt:, and 
we define a short name for our function with the keyword ``def``. The
next example shows how to define two new functions,
``lexical_diversity()`` and   ``percentage()``:

    >>> def lexical_diversity(text): # [_fun-parameter1]
    ...     return len(text) / len(set(text)) # [_locvar]
    ...
    >>> def percentage(count, total): # [_fun-parameter2]
    ...     return 100 * count / total
    ...

.. caution::
   The Python interpreter changes the prompt from
   ``>>>`` to ``...`` after encountering the colon at the
   end of the first line.  The ``...`` prompt indicates
   that Python expects an `indented code block`:dt: to appear next.
   It is up to you to do the indentation, by typing four
   spaces or hitting the tab key.  To finish the indented block just
   enter a blank line.

In the definition of ``lexical_diversity()`` fun-parameter1_, we
specify a `parameter`:dt: labeled ``text`` . This parameter is
a "placeholder" for the actual text whose lexical diversity we want to
compute, and reoccurs in the block of code that will run when the
function is used locvar_. Similarly, ``percentage()`` is defined to
take two parameters, labeled ``count`` and ``total`` fun-parameter2_.

Once Python knows that ``lexical_diversity()`` and ``percentage()``
are the names for specific blocks
of code, we can go ahead and use these functions:

    >>> lexical_diversity(text3)
    16.050197203298673
    >>> lexical_diversity(text5)
    7.4200461589185629
    >>> percentage(4, 5)
    80.0
    >>> percentage(text4.count('a'), len(text4))
    1.4643016433938312
    >>> 

To recap, we use or `call`:dt: a function such as ``lexical_diversity()`` by typing its name, followed
by an open parenthesis, the name of the text, and then a close
parenthesis. These parentheses will show up often; their role is to separate
the name of a task |mdash| such as ``lexical_diversity()`` |mdash| from the data
that the task is to be performed on |mdash| such as ``text3``.
The data value that we place in the parentheses when we call a
function is an `argument`:dt: to the function.

You have already encountered several functions in this chapter, such
as ``len()``, ``set()``, and ``sorted()``. By convention, we will
always add an empty pair of parentheses after a function name, as in
``len()``, just to make clear that what we are talking about is a
function rather than some other kind of Python expression.
Functions are an important concept in programming, and we only
mention them at the outset to give newcomers a sense of the
power and creativity of programming.  Don't worry if you find it a bit
confusing right now. 

Later we'll see how to use functions when tabulating data, as in tab-brown-types_.
Each row of the table will involve the same computation but
with different data, and we'll do this repetitive work using a function.

------------------------------------------------
A Closer Look at Python: Texts as Lists of Words
------------------------------------------------

.. reimport

    >>> from nltk.book import *
    >>> def lexical_diversity(text):
    ...     return len(text) / len(set(text))

You've seen some important elements of the Python programming language.
Let's take a few moments to review them systematically.

Lists
-----

.. XXX it's a little confusing that we assign a value to sent1 here,
   when it's already received on from the "from nltk.book import *"
   statement.  Granted it's the same value, but still...

What is a text?  At one level, it is a sequence of symbols on a page such
as this one.  At another level, it is a sequence of chapters, made up
of a sequence of sections, where each section is a sequence of paragraphs,
and so on.  However, for our purposes, we will think of a text as nothing
more than a sequence of words and punctuation.  Here's how we represent
text in Python, in this case the opening sentence of *Moby Dick*:

    >>> sent1 = ['Call', 'me', 'Ishmael', '.']
    >>>

After the prompt we've given a name we made up, ``sent1``, followed
by the equals sign, and then some quoted words, separated with
commas, and surrounded with brackets.  This bracketed material
is known as a `list`:dt: in Python: it is how we store a text.
We can inspect it by typing the name inspect-var_. We can ask for its length len-sent_.
We can even apply our own ``lexical_diversity()`` function to it apply-function_.

    >>> sent1 # [_inspect-var]
    ['Call', 'me', 'Ishmael', '.']
    >>> len(sent1) # [_len-sent]
    4
    >>> lexical_diversity(sent1) # [_apply-function]
    1.0
    >>>

Some more lists have been defined for you,
one for the opening sentence of each of our texts,
``sent2`` |dots| ``sent9``.  We inspect two of them
here; you can see the rest for yourself using the Python interpreter
(if you get an error which says that ``sent2`` is not defined, you
need to first type ``from nltk.book import *``).

    >>> sent2
    ['The', 'family', 'of', 'Dashwood', 'had', 'long',
    'been', 'settled', 'in', 'Sussex', '.']
    >>> sent3
    ['In', 'the', 'beginning', 'God', 'created', 'the',
    'heaven', 'and', 'the', 'earth', '.']
    >>>

.. note:: |TRY|
   Make up a few sentences of your own, by typing a name, equals
   sign, and a list of words, like this:
   ``ex1 = ['Monty', 'Python', 'and', 'the', 'Holy', 'Grail']``.
   Repeat some of the other Python operations we saw earlier in
   sec-computing-with-language-texts-and-words_,
   e.g., ``sorted(ex1)``, ``len(set(ex1))``, ``ex1.count('the')``.

A pleasant surprise is that we can use Python's addition operator on lists.
Adding two lists list-plus-list_ creates a new list
with everything from the first list, followed
by everything from the second list:

    >>> ['Monty', 'Python'] + ['and', 'the', 'Holy', 'Grail'] # [_list-plus-list]
    ['Monty', 'Python', 'and', 'the', 'Holy', 'Grail']

.. note::
   This special use of the addition operation is called `concatenation`:dt:;
   it combines the lists together into a single list.  We can concatenate
   sentences to build up a text.

We don't have to literally type the lists either; we can use short
names that refer to pre-defined lists.

    >>> sent4 + sent1 
    ['Fellow', '-', 'Citizens', 'of', 'the', 'Senate', 'and', 'of', 'the',
    'House', 'of', 'Representatives', ':', 'Call', 'me', 'Ishmael', '.']
    >>>

What if we want to add a single item to a list? This is known as `appending`:dt:.
When we ``append()`` to a list, the list itself is updated as a result
of the operation. 

    >>> sent1.append("Some")
    >>> sent1
    ['Call', 'me', 'Ishmael', '.', 'Some']
    >>> 

Indexing Lists
--------------

.. XXX I think a picture would be very helpful for this section, namely
   one showing something like:
       | Call   | me     | Ishmael | .     |
       0        1        2         3       4
   This might obviate the need to use a contrived sentence "word1 
   word2 etc".  I find this picture especially useful for understanding
   slicing, but it also gives a reasonable motivation for zero-indexing.

.. XXX If we end up doing this, can we offset the integers slightly so
   that they (just) fall inside the corresponding cell?

       +--------+--------+--------+--------+
       | Call   | me     | Ishmael| .      |
       |0       |1       |2       |3       |4
       +--------+--------+--------+--------+

As we have seen, a text in Python is a list of words, represented
using a combination of brackets and quotes.  Just as with an ordinary
page of text, we can count up the total number of words in ``text1``
with ``len(text1)``, and count the occurrences in a text of a
particular word |mdash| say, ``'heaven'`` |mdash| using ``text1.count('heaven')``.

With some patience, we can pick out the 1st, 173rd, or even 14,278th
word in a printed text. Analogously, we can identify the elements of a
Python list by their order of occurrence in the list. The number that
represents this position is the item's `index`:dt:.  We instruct Python
to show us the item that occurs at an index such as ``173`` in a text
by writing the name of the text followed by the index inside square brackets:

    >>> text4[173]
    'awaken'
    >>>

We can do the converse; given a word, find the index of when it first
occurs:

    >>> text4.index('awaken')
    173
    >>>

Indexes are a common way to access the words of a text,
or, more generally, the elements of any list.
Python permits us to access sublists as well, extracting
manageable pieces of language from large texts, a technique
known as `slicing`:dt:.

    >>> text5[16715:16735]
    ['U86', 'thats', 'why', 'something', 'like', 'gamefly', 'is', 'so', 'good',
    'because', 'you', 'can', 'actually', 'play', 'a', 'full', 'game', 'without',
    'buying', 'it']
    >>> text6[1600:1625]
    ['We', "'", 're', 'an', 'anarcho', '-', 'syndicalist', 'commune', '.', 'We',
    'take', 'it', 'in', 'turns', 'to', 'act', 'as', 'a', 'sort', 'of', 'executive',
    'officer', 'for', 'the', 'week']
    >>>

Indexes have some subtleties, and we'll explore these with
the help of an artificial sentence:

    >>> sent = ['word1', 'word2', 'word3', 'word4', 'word5',
    ...         'word6', 'word7', 'word8', 'word9', 'word10']
    >>> sent[0]
    'word1'
    >>> sent[9]
    'word10'
    >>>

Notice that our indexes start from zero: ``sent`` element zero, written ``sent[0]``,
is the first word, ``'word1'``, whereas ``sent`` element 9 is ``'word10'``. 
The reason is simple: the moment Python accesses the content of a list from
the computer's memory, it is already at the first element;
we have to tell it how many elements forward to go.
Thus, zero steps forward leaves it at the first element.

.. note::
   This practice of counting from zero is initially confusing,
   but typical of modern programming languages.
   You'll quickly get the hang of it if
   you've mastered the system of counting centuries where 19XY is a year
   in the 20th century, or if you live in a country where the floors of
   a building are numbered from 1, and so walking up `n-1`:math: flights of
   stairs takes you to level `n`:math:. 

Now, if we accidentally use an index that is too large, we get an error:

    >>> sent[10]
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
    IndexError: list index out of range
    >>>

This time it is not a syntax error, because the program fragment is syntactically correct.
Instead, it is a `runtime error`:dt:, and it produces a ``Traceback`` message that
shows the context of the error, followed by the name of the error,
``IndexError``, and a brief explanation.

Let's take a closer look at slicing, using our artificial sentence again.
Here we verify that the slice ``5:8`` includes ``sent`` elements at
indexes 5, 6, and 7:

    >>> sent[5:8]
    ['word6', 'word7', 'word8']
    >>> sent[5]
    'word6'
    >>> sent[6]
    'word7'
    >>> sent[7]
    'word8'
    >>>

By convention, ``m:n`` means elements `m`:mathit:\ |dots|\ `n-1`:mathit:.
As the next example shows,
we can omit the first number if the slice begins at the start of the
list slice2_, and we can omit the second number if the slice goes to the end slice3_:

    >>> sent[:3] # [_slice2]
    ['word1', 'word2', 'word3']
    >>> text2[141525:] # [_slice3]
    ['among', 'the', 'merits', 'and', 'the', 'happiness', 'of', 'Elinor', 'and', 'Marianne',
    ',', 'let', 'it', 'not', 'be', 'ranked', 'as', 'the', 'least', 'considerable', ',',
    'that', 'though', 'sisters', ',', 'and', 'living', 'almost', 'within', 'sight', 'of',
    'each', 'other', ',', 'they', 'could', 'live', 'without', 'disagreement', 'between',
    'themselves', ',', 'or', 'producing', 'coolness', 'between', 'their', 'husbands', '.',
    'THE', 'END']
    >>>

We can modify an element of a list by assigning to one of its index values.
In the next example, we put ``sent[0]`` on the left of the equals sign list-assignment_.  We can also
replace an entire slice with new material slice-assignment_.  A consequence of this
last change is that the list only has four elements, and accessing a later value
generates an error list-error_.

    >>> sent[0] = 'First' # [_list-assignment]
    >>> sent[9] = 'Last'
    >>> len(sent)
    10
    >>> sent[1:9] = ['Second', 'Third'] # [_slice-assignment]
    >>> sent
    ['First', 'Second', 'Third', 'Last']
    >>> sent[9] # [_list-error]
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
    IndexError: list index out of range
    >>>    

.. note:: |TRY|
   Take a few minutes to define a sentence of your own and modify individual words and
   groups of words (slices) using the same methods used earlier.  Check your understanding
   by trying the exercises on lists at the end of this chapter.

Variables
---------

From the start of sec-computing-with-language-texts-and-words_, you have had
access to texts called ``text1``, ``text2``, and so on.  It saved a lot
of typing to be able to refer to a 250,000-word book with a short name
like this!  In general, we can make up names for anything we care
to calculate.  We did this ourselves in the previous sections, e.g.,
defining a `variable`:dt: ``sent1``, as follows:

    >>> sent1 = ['Call', 'me', 'Ishmael', '.']
    >>>

Such lines have the form: *variable = expression*.  Python will evaluate
the expression, and save its result to the variable.  This process is
called `assignment`:dt:.  It does not generate any output;
you have to type the variable on a line of its
own to inspect its contents.  The equals sign is slightly misleading,
since information is moving from the right side to the left.
It might help to think of it as a left-arrow.
The name of the variable can be anything you like, e.g., ``my_sent``, ``sentence``, ``xyzzy``.
It must start with a letter, and can include numbers and underscores.
Here are some examples of variables and assignments:
  
    >>> my_sent = ['Bravely', 'bold', 'Sir', 'Robin', ',', 'rode',
    ... 'forth', 'from', 'Camelot', '.']
    >>> noun_phrase = my_sent[1:4]
    >>> noun_phrase
    ['bold', 'Sir', 'Robin']
    >>> wOrDs = sorted(noun_phrase)
    >>> wOrDs
    ['Robin', 'Sir', 'bold']
    >>>

Remember that capitalized words appear before lowercase words in sorted lists.

.. note::
   Notice in the previous example that we split the definition
   of ``my_sent`` over two lines.  Python expressions can be split across
   multiple lines, so long as this happens within any kind of brackets.
   Python uses the "``...``" prompt to indicate that more input is
   expected.  It doesn't matter how much indentation is used in these
   continuation lines, but some indentation usually makes them easier to read.

It is good to choose meaningful variable names to remind you |mdash| and to help anyone
else who reads your Python code |mdash| what your code is meant to do.
Python does not try to make sense of the names; it blindly follows your instructions,
and does not object if you do something confusing, such as ``one = 'two'`` or ``two = 3``.
The only restriction is that
a variable name cannot be any of Python's reserved words, such as
``def``, ``if``, ``not``,
and ``import``.  If you use a reserved word, Python will produce a syntax error:

    >>> not = 'Camelot'
    File "<stdin>", line 1
        not = 'Camelot'
            ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    >>>

We will often use variables to hold intermediate steps of a computation, especially
when this makes the code easier to follow.  Thus ``len(set(text1))`` could also be written:

    >>> vocab = set(text1)
    >>> vocab_size = len(vocab)
    >>> vocab_size
    19317
    >>>

.. caution::
   Take care with your choice of names (or `identifiers`:dt:) for Python
   variables.  First, you should start the name with a letter, optionally
   followed by digits (``0`` to ``9``) or letters. Thus, ``abc23`` is fine, but
   ``23abc`` will cause a syntax error. 
   Names are case-sensitive, which means that ``myVar`` and ``myvar``
   are distinct variables.  Variable names cannot contain whitespace,
   but you can separate words using an underscore, e.g.,
   ``my_var``. Be careful not to insert a hyphen instead of an
   underscore: ``my-var`` is wrong, since Python interprets the
   "``-``" as a minus sign. 

Strings
-------

Some of the methods we used to access the elements of a list also work with individual words,
or `strings`:dt:.  For example, we can assign a string to a variable assign-string_,
index a string index-string_, and slice a string slice-string_:

    >>> name = 'Monty' # [_assign-string]
    >>> name[0] # [_index-string]
    'M'
    >>> name[:4] # [_slice-string]
    'Mont'
    >>>

We can also perform multiplication and addition with strings:

    >>> name * 2
    'MontyMonty'
    >>> name + '!'
    'Monty!'
    >>>

We can join the words of a list to make a single string, or split a string into a list, as follows:

    >>> ' '.join(['Monty', 'Python'])
    'Monty Python'
    >>> 'Monty Python'.split()
    ['Monty', 'Python']
    >>>

We will come back to the topic of strings in chap-words_.
For the time being, we have two important building blocks
|mdash| lists and strings |mdash|
and are ready to get back to some language analysis.

.. _sec-computing-with-language-simple-statistics:

------------------------------------------
Computing with Language: Simple Statistics
------------------------------------------

.. reimport

   >>> from nltk.book import *

Let's return to our exploration of the ways we can bring our computational
resources to bear on large quantities of text.  We began this discussion in
sec-computing-with-language-texts-and-words_, and saw how to search for words
in context, how to compile the vocabulary of a text, how to generate random
text in the same style, and so on.

In this section we pick up the question of what makes a text distinct,
and use automatic methods to find characteristic words and expressions
of a text.  As in sec-computing-with-language-texts-and-words_, you can try
new features of the Python language by copying them into the interpreter,
and you'll learn about these features systematically in the following section.

Before continuing further, you might like to check your understanding of the
last section by predicting the output of the following code.  You can use
the interpreter to check whether you got it right.  If you're not sure how
to do this task, it would be a good idea to review the previous section
before continuing further.

.. doctest-ignore::
    >>> saying = ['After', 'all', 'is', 'said', 'and', 'done',
    ...           'more', 'is', 'said', 'than', 'done']
    >>> tokens = set(saying)
    >>> tokens = sorted(tokens)
    >>> tokens[-2:]
    what output do you expect here?
    >>>



Frequency Distributions
-----------------------

How can we automatically identify the words of a text that are most
informative about the topic and genre of the text?  Imagine how you might
go about finding the 50 most frequent words of a book.  One method
would be to keep a tally for each vocabulary item, like that shown in fig-tally_.
The tally would need thousands of rows, and it would be an exceedingly
laborious process |mdash| so laborious that we would rather assign the task to a machine.

.. _fig-tally:
.. figure:: ../images/tally.png
   :scale: 20:100:25

   Counting Words Appearing in a Text (a frequency distribution)

The table in fig-tally_ is known as a `frequency distribution`:dt:,
and it tells us the frequency of each vocabulary item in the text.
(In general, it could count any kind of observable event.)
It is a "distribution"
because it tells us how the total number of word tokens in the text
are distributed across the vocabulary items.
Since we often need frequency distributions in language processing, NLTK
provides built-in support for them.  Let's use a ``FreqDist`` to find the
50 most frequent words of *Moby Dick*.  Try to work out what is going on here,
then read the explanation that follows.

    >>> fdist1 = FreqDist(text1) # [_freq-dist-call]
    >>> fdist1 # [_freq-dist-inspect]
    <FreqDist with 260819 outcomes>
    >>> vocabulary1 = fdist1.keys() # [_freq-dist-keys]
    >>> vocabulary1[:50] # [_freq-dist-slice]
    [',', 'the', '.', 'of', 'and', 'a', 'to', ';', 'in', 'that', "'", '-',
    'his', 'it', 'I', 's', 'is', 'he', 'with', 'was', 'as', '"', 'all', 'for',
    'this', '!', 'at', 'by', 'but', 'not', '--', 'him', 'from', 'be', 'on',
    'so', 'whale', 'one', 'you', 'had', 'have', 'there', 'But', 'or', 'were',
    'now', 'which', '?', 'me', 'like']
    >>> fdist1['whale']
    906
    >>>

When we first invoke ``FreqDist``, we pass the name of the text as an
argument freq-dist-call_. We can inspect the total number of words ("outcomes")
that have been counted up freq-dist-inspect_ |mdash| 260,819 in the
case of *Moby Dick*. The expression ``keys()`` gives us a list of all
the distinct types in the text freq-dist-keys_, and we can look at the
first 50 of these by slicing the list freq-dist-slice_.

.. note:: |TRY|
   Try the preceding frequency distribution example for yourself, for
   ``text2``.  Be careful to use the correct parentheses and uppercase letters.
   If you get an error message ``NameError: name 'FreqDist' is not defined``,
   you need to start your work with ``from nltk.book import *``

.. SB: no period after the above import statement

Do any words produced in the last example help us grasp the topic or genre of this text?
Only one word, `whale`:lx:, is slightly informative!  It occurs over 900 times.
The rest of the words tell us nothing about the text; they're just English "plumbing."
What proportion of the text is taken up with such words?
We can generate a cumulative frequency plot for these words,
using ``fdist1.plot(50, cumulative=True)``, to produce the graph in fig-fdist-moby_.
These 50 words account for nearly half the book!

.. _fig-fdist-moby:
.. figure:: ../images/fdist-moby.png
   :scale: 20:25:25

   Cumulative Frequency Plot for 50 Most Frequently Words in *Moby Dick*:
   these account for nearly half of the tokens.

If the frequent words don't help us, how about the words that occur once
only, the so-called `hapaxes`:dt:?  View them by typing ``fdist1.hapaxes()``.
This list contains `lexicographer`:lx:, `cetological`:lx:,
`contraband`:lx:, `expostulations`:lx:, and about 9,000 others.
It seems that there are too many rare words, and without seeing the
context we probably can't guess what half of the hapaxes mean in any case!
Since neither frequent nor infrequent words help, we need to try
something else.

Fine-grained Selection of Words
-------------------------------

Next, let's look at the *long* words of a text; perhaps these will be
more characteristic and informative.  For this we adapt some notation
from set theory.  We would like to find the words from the vocabulary
of the text that are more than 15 characters long.  Let's call
this property `P`:math:, so that `P(w)`:math: is true
if and only if `w`:math: is more than 15 characters long.
Now we can express the words of interest using mathematical 
set notation as shown in ex-set-comprehension-math_.
This means "the set of all `w`:math: such that `w`:math: is an
element of `V`:math: (the vocabulary) and `w`:math: has property `P`:math:".

.. _ex-set-comprehension:
.. ex::
   .. _ex-set-comprehension-math:
   .. ex:: {`w`:math: | `w`:math: |element| `V`:math: & `P(w)`:math:\ }
   .. _ex-set-comprehension-python:
   .. ex:: ``[w for w in V if p(w)]``

The corresponding Python expression is given in ex-set-comprehension-python_.
(Note that it produces a list, not a set, which means that duplicates are possible.)
Observe how similar the two notations are.  Let's go one more step and
write executable Python code:

    >>> V = set(text1)
    >>> long_words = [w for w in V if len(w) > 15]
    >>> sorted(long_words)
    ['CIRCUMNAVIGATION', 'Physiognomically', 'apprehensiveness', 'cannibalistically',
    'characteristically', 'circumnavigating', 'circumnavigation', 'circumnavigations',
    'comprehensiveness', 'hermaphroditical', 'indiscriminately', 'indispensableness',
    'irresistibleness', 'physiognomically', 'preternaturalness', 'responsibilities',
    'simultaneousness', 'subterraneousness', 'supernaturalness', 'superstitiousness',
    'uncomfortableness', 'uncompromisedness', 'undiscriminating', 'uninterpenetratingly']
    >>>

For each word ``w`` in the vocabulary ``V``, we check whether
``len(w)`` is greater than 15; all other words will
be ignored.  We will discuss this syntax more carefully later.

.. note:: |TRY|
   Try out the previous statements in the Python interpreter,
   and experiment with changing the text and changing the length condition.
   Does it make an difference to your results if you change the
   variable names, e.g., using ``[word for word in vocab if ...]``? 

Let's return to our task of finding words that characterize a text.
Notice that the long words in ``text4`` reflect its national focus
|mdash| `constitutionally`:lx:, `transcontinental`:lx: |mdash|
whereas those in ``text5`` reflect its informal content:
`boooooooooooglyyyyyy`:lx: and `yuuuuuuuuuuuummmmmmmmmmmm`:lx:.
Have we succeeded in automatically extracting words that typify
a text?  Well, these very long words are often hapaxes (i.e., unique)
and perhaps it would be better to find *frequently occurring*
long words.  This seems promising since it eliminates
frequent short words (e.g., `the`:lx:) and infrequent long words
(e.g. `antiphilosophists`:lx:).
Here are all words from the chat corpus
that are longer than seven characters, that occur more than seven times:

    >>> fdist5 = FreqDist(text5)
    >>> sorted([w for w in set(text5) if len(w) > 7 and fdist5[w] > 7])
    ['#14-19teens', '#talkcity_adults', '((((((((((', '........', 'Question',
    'actually', 'anything', 'computer', 'cute.-ass', 'everyone', 'football',
    'innocent', 'listening', 'remember', 'seriously', 'something', 'together',
    'tomorrow', 'watching']
    >>>

Notice how we have used two conditions: ``len(w) > 7`` ensures that the
words are longer than seven letters, and ``fdist5[w] > 7`` ensures that
these words occur more than seven times.  At last we have managed to
automatically identify the frequently-occurring content-bearing
words of the text.  It is a modest but important milestone: a tiny piece of code,
processing tens of thousands of words, produces some informative output.

Collocations and Bigrams
------------------------

A `collocation`:dt: is a sequence of words that occur together
unusually often. Thus `red wine`:lx: is a collocation, whereas `the
wine`:lx: is not. A characteristic of collocations is that they are
resistant to substitution with words that have similar senses;
for example, `maroon wine`:lx: sounds definitely odd.  

To get a handle on collocations, we start off by extracting from a text
a list of word pairs, also known as `bigrams`:dt:. This is easily
accomplished with the function ``bigrams()``:

    >>> bigrams(['more', 'is', 'said', 'than', 'done'])
    [('more', 'is'), ('is', 'said'), ('said', 'than'), ('than', 'done')]
    >>>

Here we see that the pair of words `than-done`:lx: is a bigram, and we write
it in Python as ``('than', 'done')``.  Now, collocations are essentially
just frequent bigrams, except that we want to pay more attention to the
cases that involve rare words.  In particular, we want to find
bigrams that occur more often than we would expect based on
the frequency of individual words.  The ``collocations()`` function
does this for us (we will see how it works later):

    >>> text4.collocations()
    Building collocations list
    United States; fellow citizens; years ago; Federal Government; General
    Government; American people; Vice President; Almighty God; Fellow
    citizens; Chief Magistrate; Chief Justice; God bless; Indian tribes;
    public debt; foreign nations; political parties; State governments;
    National Government; United Nations; public money
    >>> text8.collocations()
    Building collocations list
    medium build; social drinker; quiet nights; long term; age open;
    financially secure; fun times; similar interests; Age open; poss
    rship; single mum; permanent relationship; slim build; seeks lady;
    Late 30s; Photo pls; Vibrant personality; European background; ASIAN
    LADY; country drives
    >>>

The collocations that emerge are very specific to the genre of the
texts. In order to find  `red wine`:lx: as a collocation, we would
need to process a much larger body of text.

Counting Other Things
---------------------

Counting words is useful, but we can count other things too.  For example, we can
look at the distribution of word lengths in a text, by creating a ``FreqDist``
out of a long list of numbers, where each number is the length of the corresponding
word in the text: 

    >>> [len(w) for w in text1] # [_word-lengths]
    [1, 4, 4, 2, 6, 8, 4, 1, 9, 1, 1, 8, 2, 1, 4, 11, 5, 2, 1, 7, 6, 1, 3, 4, 5, 2, ...]
    >>> fdist = FreqDist([len(w) for w in text1])  # [_freq-word-lengths]
    >>> fdist  # [_freq-word-lengths-size]
    <FreqDist with 260819 outcomes>
    >>> fdist.keys()
    [3, 1, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20]
    >>>

We start by deriving a list of the lengths of words in ``text1``
word-lengths_,
and the ``FreqDist`` then counts the number of times each of these
occurs freq-word-lengths_. The result freq-word-lengths-size_ is a distribution containing
a quarter of a million items, each of which is a number corresponding to a
word token in the text.  But there are only 20 distinct
items being counted, the numbers 1 through 20, because there are only 20
different word lengths.  I.e., there are words consisting of just one character,
two characters, ..., twenty characters, but none with twenty one or more
characters.  One might wonder how frequent the different lengths of word are
(e.g., how many words of length four appear in the text, are there more words of length five
than length four, etc). We can do this as follows:

    >>> fdist.items()
    [(3, 50223), (1, 47933), (4, 42345), (2, 38513), (5, 26597), (6, 17111), (7, 14399),
    (8, 9966), (9, 6428), (10, 3528), (11, 1873), (12, 1053), (13, 567), (14, 177),
    (15, 70), (16, 22), (17, 12), (18, 1), (20, 1)]
    >>> fdist.max()
    3
    >>> fdist[3]
    50223
    >>> fdist.freq(3)
    0.19255882431878046
    >>>

From this we see that the most frequent word length is 3, and that
words of length 3 account for roughly 50,000 (or 20%) of the words making up the
book.  Although we will not pursue it here, further analysis of word
length might help us understand differences between authors, genres, or
languages.

tab-freqdist_ summarizes the functions defined in frequency distributions.

   Functions Defined for |NLTK|\ 's Frequency Distributions

Our discussion of frequency distributions has introduced some important Python concepts,
and we will look at them systematically in sec-making-decisions_.

.. 
   We've also touched on the topic of normalization, and we'll explore this in
   depth in chap-words_.   

.. _sec-making-decisions:

---------------------------------------------------
Back to Python: Making Decisions and Taking Control
---------------------------------------------------

.. reimport

   >>> from nltk.book import *

So far, our little programs have had some interesting qualities:
the ability to work with language, and
the potential to save human effort through automation.
A key feature of programming is the ability of machines to
make decisions on our behalf, executing instructions when
certain conditions are met, or repeatedly looping through
text data until some condition is satisfied.  This feature
is known as `control`:dt:, and is the focus of this section.

Conditionals
------------

Python supports a wide range of operators, such as ``<`` and ``>=``, for
testing the relationship between values. The full set of these `relational
operators`:dt: are shown in tab-inequalities_.

.. table:: tab-inequalities

   ======== ==================================================
   Operator Relationship
   ======== ==================================================
   ``<``    less than
   ``<=``   less than or equal to
   ``==``   equal to (note this is two "``=``" signs, not one)
   ``!=``   not equal to
   ``>``    greater than
   ``>=``   greater than or equal to
   ======== ==================================================

   Numerical Comparison Operators

We can use these to select different words from a sentence of news text.
Here are some examples |mdash| only the operator is changed from one
line to the next.  They all use ``sent7``, the first sentence from ``text7``
(*Wall Street Journal*).  As before, if you get an error saying that ``sent7``
is undefined, you need to first type: ``from nltk.book import *``

.. SB: no period after above import statement

    >>> sent7
    ['Pierre', 'Vinken', ',', '61', 'years', 'old', ',', 'will', 'join', 'the',
    'board', 'as', 'a', 'nonexecutive', 'director', 'Nov.', '29', '.']
    >>> [w for w in sent7 if len(w) < 4]
    [',', '61', 'old', ',', 'the', 'as', 'a', '29', '.']
    >>> [w for w in sent7 if len(w) <= 4]
    [',', '61', 'old', ',', 'will', 'join', 'the', 'as', 'a', 'Nov.', '29', '.']
    >>> [w for w in sent7 if len(w) == 4]
    ['will', 'join', 'Nov.']
    >>> [w for w in sent7 if len(w) != 4]
    ['Pierre', 'Vinken', ',', '61', 'years', 'old', ',', 'the', 'board',
    'as', 'a', 'nonexecutive', 'director', '29', '.']
    >>> 

There is a common pattern to all of these examples:
``[w for w in text if`` *condition* ``]``, where *condition* is a
Python "test" that yields either true or false.
In the cases shown in the previous code example, the condition is always a numerical comparison.
However, we can also test various properties of words,
using the functions listed in tab-word-tests_.

.. table:: tab-word-tests

   ====================   ===========================================================================
   Function               Meaning
   ====================   ===========================================================================
   ``s.startswith(t)``    test if ``s`` starts with ``t``
   ``s.endswith(t)``      test if ``s`` ends with ``t``
   ``t in s``             test if ``t`` is contained inside ``s``
   ``s.islower()``        test if all cased characters in ``s`` are lowercase
   ``s.isupper()``        test if all cased characters in ``s`` are uppercase
   ``s.isalpha()``        test if all characters in ``s`` are alphabetic
   ``s.isalnum()``        test if all characters in ``s`` are alphanumeric
   ``s.isdigit()``        test if all characters in ``s`` are digits
   ``s.istitle()``        test if ``s`` is titlecased (all words in ``s`` have have initial capitals)
   ====================   ===========================================================================

   Some Word Comparison Operators

Here are some examples of these operators being used to
select words from our texts:
words ending with `-ableness`:lx:;
words containing `gnt`:lx:;
words having an initial capital;
and words consisting entirely of digits.

    >>> sorted([w for w in set(text1) if w.endswith('ableness')])
    ['comfortableness', 'honourableness', 'immutableness', 'indispensableness', ...]
    >>> sorted([term for term in set(text4) if 'gnt' in term])
    ['Sovereignty', 'sovereignties', 'sovereignty']
    >>> sorted([item for item in set(text6) if item.istitle()])
    ['A', 'Aaaaaaaaah', 'Aaaaaaaah', 'Aaaaaah', 'Aaaah', 'Aaaaugh', 'Aaagh', ...] 
    >>> sorted([item for item in set(sent7) if item.isdigit()])
    ['29', '61']
    >>>

We can also create more complex conditions.  If `c`:math: is a
condition, then ``not`` `c`:math: is also a condition.
If we have two conditions `c`:math:\ `1`:subscript: and `c`:math:\ `2`:subscript:,
then we can combine them to form a new condition using conjunction and disjunction:
`c`:math:\ `1`:subscript: ``and`` `c`:math:\ `2`:subscript:,
`c`:math:\ `1`:subscript: ``or`` `c`:math:\ `2`:subscript:.

.. note:: |TRY|
   Run the following examples and try to explain what is going on in each one.
   Next, try to make up some conditions of your own.

   .. doctest-ignore::
      >>> sorted([w for w in set(text7) if '-' in w and 'index' in w])
      >>> sorted([wd for wd in set(text3) if wd.istitle() and len(wd) > 10])
      >>> sorted([w for w in set(sent7) if not w.islower()])
      >>> sorted([t for t in set(text2) if 'cie' in t or 'cei' in t])

Operating on Every Element
--------------------------

In sec-computing-with-language-simple-statistics_, we saw some examples of
counting items other than words.  Let's take a closer look at the notation we used:

    >>> [len(w) for w in text1]
    [1, 4, 4, 2, 6, 8, 4, 1, 9, 1, 1, 8, 2, 1, 4, 11, 5, 2, 1, 7, 6, 1, 3, 4, 5, 2, ...]
    >>> [w.upper() for w in text1]
    ['[', 'MOBY', 'DICK', 'BY', 'HERMAN', 'MELVILLE', '1851', ']', 'ETYMOLOGY', '.', ...]
    >>>

These expressions have the form ``[f(w) for ...]`` or ``[w.f() for ...]``, where
``f`` is a function that operates on a word to compute its length, or to
convert it to uppercase.
For now, you don't need to understand the difference between the notations ``f(w)`` and
``w.f()``.  Instead, simply learn this Python idiom which performs the
same operation on every element of a list.  In the preceding examples, it goes through
each word in ``text1``, assigning each one in turn to the variable ``w`` and
performing the specified operation on the variable.

.. note::
   The notation just described is called a "list comprehension."  This is our first example
   of a Python idiom, a fixed notation that we use habitually without bothering to
   analyze each time.  Mastering such idioms is an important part of becoming a
   fluent Python programmer.

Let's return to the question of vocabulary size, and apply the same idiom here:

    >>> len(text1)
    260819
    >>> len(set(text1))
    19317
    >>> len(set([word.lower() for word in text1]))
    17231
    >>>

Now that we are not double-counting words like `This`:lx: and `this`:lx:, which differ only
in capitalization, we've wiped 2,000 off the vocabulary count!  We can go a step further
and eliminate numbers and punctuation from the vocabulary count by filtering out any
non-alphabetic items:

    >>> len(set([word.lower() for word in text1 if word.isalpha()]))
    16948
    >>> 

This example is slightly complicated: it lowercases all the purely alphabetic items.
Perhaps it would have been simpler just to count the lowercase-only items, but this
gives the wrong answer (why?).

Don't worry if you don't feel confident with list comprehensions yet,
since you'll see many more examples along with explanations in the following chapters.

Nested Code Blocks
------------------

Most programming languages permit us to execute a block of code when a
`conditional expression`:dt:, or ``if`` statement, is satisfied.  We
already saw examples of conditional tests in code like ``[w for w in
sent7 if len(w) < 4]``. In the following program, we have created a
variable called ``word`` containing the string value ``'cat'``. The
``if`` statement checks whether the test ``len(word) < 5`` is true.
It is, so the body of the ``if`` statement is invoked and the
``print`` statement is executed, displaying a message to the user.
Remember to indent the ``print`` statement by typing four spaces.

    >>> word = 'cat'
    >>> if len(word) < 5:
    ...     print 'word length is less than 5'
    ...   # [_blank-line]
    word length is less than 5
    >>>

When we use the Python interpreter we have to add an extra blank line blank-line_
in order for it to detect that the nested block is complete.

If we change the conditional test to ``len(word) >= 5``,
to check that the length of ``word`` is greater than or equal to ``5``,
then the test will no longer be true.
This time, the body of the ``if`` statement will not be executed,
and no message is shown to the user:

    >>> if len(word) >= 5:
    ...   print 'word length is greater than or equal to 5'
    ... 
    >>>

An ``if`` statement is known as a `control structure`:dt:
because it controls whether the code in the indented block will be run.
Another control structure is the ``for`` loop.
Try the following, and remember to include the colon and the four spaces:

    >>> for word in ['Call', 'me', 'Ishmael', '.']:
    ...     print word
    ...
    Call
    me
    Ishmael
    .
    >>>

This is called a loop because Python executes the code in
circular fashion.  It starts by performing the
assignment ``word = 'Call'``,
effectively using the ``word`` variable to name the first
item of the list.  Then, it displays the value of ``word``
to the user.  Next, it goes back to the ``for`` statement,
and performs the assignment ``word = 'me'``, before displaying this new value
to the user, and so on.  It continues in this fashion until
every item of the list has been processed.

Looping with Conditions
-----------------------

Now we can combine the ``if`` and ``for`` statements.
We will loop over every item of the list, and print
the item only if it ends with the letter *l*.  We'll pick another
name for the variable to demonstrate that Python doesn't
try to make sense of variable names.

    >>> sent1 = ['Call', 'me', 'Ishmael', '.']
    >>> for xyzzy in sent1:
    ...     if xyzzy.endswith('l'):
    ...         print xyzzy
    ...
    Call
    Ishmael
    >>>

You will notice that ``if`` and ``for`` statements
have a colon at the end of the line,
before the indentation begins. In fact, all Python
control structures end with a colon.  The colon
indicates that the current statement relates to the
indented block that follows.

We can also specify an action to be taken if
the condition of the ``if`` statement is not met.
Here we see the ``elif`` (else if) statement, and
the ``else`` statement.  Notice that these also have
colons before the indented code.

    >>> for token in sent1:
    ...     if token.islower():
    ...         print token, 'is a lowercase word'
    ...     elif token.istitle():
    ...         print token, 'is a titlecase word'
    ...     else:
    ...         print token, 'is punctuation'
    ...
    Call is a titlecase word
    me is a lowercase word
    Ishmael is a titlecase word
    . is punctuation
    >>>

As you can see, even with this small amount of Python knowledge,
you can start to build multiline Python programs.
It's important to develop such programs in pieces,
testing that each piece does what you expect before
combining them into a program.  This is why the Python
interactive interpreter is so invaluable, and why you should get
comfortable using it.

Finally, let's combine the idioms we've been exploring.
First, we create a list of `cie`:lx: and `cei`:lx: words,
then we loop over each item and print it.  Notice the
comma at the end of the print statement, which tells
Python to produce its output on a single line.

    >>> tricky = sorted([w for w in set(text2) if 'cie' in w or 'cei' in w])
    >>> for word in tricky:
    ...     print word,
    ancient ceiling conceit conceited conceive conscience
    conscientious conscientiously deceitful deceive ...
    >>>

Automatic Natural Language Understanding

We have been exploring language bottom-up, with the help of texts and
the Python programming
language.  However, we're also interested in exploiting our knowledge of language and computation
by building useful language technologies. We'll take the opportunity
now to step back from the nitty-gritty of code in order to paint a
bigger picture of natural language processing.

At a purely practical level, we all need help to navigate the universe of information
locked up in text on the Web.  Search engines have been crucial to the
growth and popularity of the Web, but have some shortcomings.
It takes skill, knowledge, and some luck,
to extract answers to such questions as: `What tourist sites can I
visit between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh on a limited budget?`:lx:
`What do experts say about digital SLR cameras?`:lx: `What
predictions about the steel market were made by credible commentators
in the past week?`:lx: Getting a computer to answer them automatically
involves a range of language processing tasks, including information extraction,
inference, and summarization, and would need to be carried out on a scale
and with a level of robustness that is still beyond our current capabilities.

On a more philosophical level, a long-standing challenge within artificial intelligence
has been to build intelligent machines, and a major part of intelligent behaviour is understanding
language.  For many years this goal has been seen as too difficult.
However, as |NLP| technologies become more mature, and robust methods for
analyzing unrestricted text become more widespread, the prospect of
natural language understanding has re-emerged as a plausible goal.

In this section we describe some language understanding technologies,
to give you a sense of the interesting challenges that are waiting for you.

Word Sense Disambiguation
-------------------------

In `word sense disambiguation`:dt: we want to work out
which sense of a word was intended in a given context.  Consider the
ambiguous words `serve`:lx: and `dish`:lx:\ :

.. ex::
    .. ex:: `serve`:lx:\ : help with food or drink; hold an office; put ball into play
    .. ex:: `dish`:lx:\ : plate; course of a meal; communications device

In a sentence containing the phrase: `he served the dish`:lx:, you
can detect that both `serve`:lx: and `dish`:lx: are being used with
their food meanings.  It's unlikely that the topic of discussion
shifted from sports to crockery in the space of three words.
This would force you to invent bizarre images, like a tennis pro
taking out their frustrations on a china tea-set laid out beside the court. 
In other words, we automatically disambiguate words using context, exploiting
the simple fact that nearby words have closely related meanings.
As another example of this contextual effect, consider the word
`by`:lx:, which has several meanings, e.g.: `the book by
Chesterton`:lx: (agentive |mdash| Chesterton was the author of the book);
`the cup by the stove`:lx: (locative |mdash| the stove is where the
cup is); and `submit by Friday`:lx: (temporal |mdash| Friday is the
time of the submitting).
Observe in ex-lost-children_ that the meaning of the italicized word helps us
interpret the meaning of `by`:lx:.

.. _ex-lost-children:
.. ex::
   .. ex:: The lost children were found by the `searchers`:em:  (agentive)
   .. ex:: The lost children were found by the `mountain`:em:   (locative)
   .. ex:: The lost children were found by the `afternoon`:em:  (temporal)

Pronoun Resolution
------------------

A deeper kind of language understanding is to work out "who did what to whom" |mdash|
i.e., to detect the subjects and objects of verbs.  You learnt to do this in
elementary school, but it's harder than you might think.
In the sentence `the thieves stole the paintings`:lx:
it is easy to tell who performed the stealing action.
Consider three possible following sentences in ex-thieves_, and try to determine
what was sold, caught, and found (one case is ambiguous).
  
.. _ex-thieves:
.. ex::
   .. ex:: The thieves stole the paintings.  They were subsequently `sold`:em:.
   .. ex:: The thieves stole the paintings.  They were subsequently `caught`:em:.
   .. ex:: The thieves stole the paintings.  They were subsequently `found`:em:.

Answering this question involves finding the `antecedent`:dt: of the pronoun `they`:lx:,
either thieves or paintings.  Computational techniques for tackling this problem
include `anaphora resolution`:dt: |mdash| identifying what a pronoun or noun phrase
refers to |mdash| and `semantic role labeling`:dt: |mdash| identifying how a noun phrase
relates to the verb (as agent, patient, instrument, and so on).

Generating Language Output
--------------------------

If we can automatically solve such problems of language understanding, we will
be able to move on to tasks that involve generating language output, such as
`question answering`:dt: and `machine translation`:dt:.  In the first case,
a machine should be able to answer a user's questions relating to collection of texts:

.. _ex-qa-application:
.. ex::
   .. ex:: *Text:* ... The thieves stole the paintings.  They were subsequently sold. ...
   .. ex:: *Human:* Who or what was sold?
   .. ex:: *Machine:* The paintings.

The machine's answer demonstrates that it has correctly worked out that `they`:lx:
refers to paintings and not to thieves.  In the second case, the machine should
be able to translate the text into another language, accurately
conveying the meaning of the original text.  In translating the example text into French,
we are forced to choose the gender of the pronoun in the second sentence:
`ils`:lx: (masculine) if the thieves are found, and `elles`:lx: (feminine) if
the paintings are found.  Correct translation actually depends on correct understanding of
the pronoun.

.. _ex-mt-application:
.. ex::
   .. ex:: The thieves stole the paintings.  They were subsequently found.
   .. ex:: Les voleurs ont vol\ |eacute| les peintures. Ils ont |eacute|\ t\ |eacute| trouv\ |eacute|\ s plus tard.  (the thieves)
   .. ex:: Les voleurs ont vol\ |eacute| les peintures. Elles ont |eacute|\ t\ |eacute| trouv\ |eacute|\ es plus tard.  (the paintings)
    
In all of these examples, working out the sense of a word, the subject of a verb, and the 
antecedent of a pronoun are steps in establishing the meaning of a sentence, things
we would expect a language understanding system to be able to do.

Machine Translation
-------------------

For a long time now, machine translation (MT) has
been the holy grail of language understanding,
ultimately seeking to provide high-quality,
idiomatic translation between any pair of languages.
Its roots go back to the early days of the Cold War, when the promise
of automatic translation led to substantial government sponsorship,
and with it, the genesis of |NLP| itself.

Today, practical translation systems exist for particular pairs
of languages, and some are integrated into web search engines.
However, these systems have some serious shortcomings.
We can explore them with the help of |NLTK|\ 's "babelizer"
(which is automatically loaded when you import ths chapter's
materials using ``from nltk.book import *``).
This program submits a sentence for translation into a
specified language, then submits the resulting sentence for translation
back into English.  It stops after 12 iterations, or if it receives
a translation that was produced already (indicating a loop):

.. doctest-ignore::
    >>> babelize_shell()
    NLTK Babelizer: type 'help' for a list of commands.
    Babel> how long before the next flight to Alice Springs?
    Babel> german
    Babel> run
    0> how long before the next flight to Alice Springs?
    1> wie lang vor dem folgenden Flug zu Alice Springs?
    2> how long before the following flight to Alice jump?
    3> wie lang vor dem folgenden Flug zu Alice springen Sie?
    4> how long before the following flight to Alice do you jump?
    5> wie lang, bevor der folgende Flug zu Alice tun, Sie springen?
    6> how long, before the following flight to Alice does, do you jump?
    7> wie lang bevor der folgende Flug zu Alice tut, tun Sie springen?
    8> how long before the following flight to Alice does, do you jump?
    9> wie lang, bevor der folgende Flug zu Alice tut, tun Sie springen?
    10> how long, before the following flight does to Alice, do do you jump?
    11> wie lang bevor der folgende Flug zu Alice tut, Sie tun Sprung?
    12> how long before the following flight does leap to Alice, does you?

Observe that the system correctly translates `Alice Springs`:lx: from English
to German (in the line starting ``1>``), but on the way back to English, this ends up as `Alice jump`:lx:
(line ``2``).  The preposition `before`:lx: is initially translated into the corresponding
German preposition `vor`:lx:, but later into the conjunction `bevor`:lx: (line 5).
After line ``5`` the sentences become nonsensical (but notice the various phrasings
indicated by the commas, and the change from `jump`:lx: to `leap`:lx:).
The translation system did not recognize when a word was part of a proper name,
and it misinterpreted the grammatical structure.  The grammatical problems
are more obvious in the following example.  Did John find the pig, or did the
pig find John?

.. doctest-ignore::
    >>> babelize_shell()
    Babel> The pig that John found looked happy
    Babel> german 
    Babel> run
    0> The pig that John found looked happy
    1> Das Schwein, das John fand, schaute gl?cklich
    2> The pig, which found John, looked happy

Machine translation is difficult because a given word could have several possible
translations (depending on its meaning), and because word order must be changed
in keeping with the grammatical structure of the target language.
Today these difficulties are being faced by collecting massive quantities of
parallel texts from news and government websites that publish documents
in two or more languages.  Given a document in German and English, and possibly
a bilingual dictionary, we can automatically pair up the sentences,
a process called `text alignment`:dt:.  Once we have a million or more sentence
pairs, we can detect corresponding words and phrases, and build a model
that can be used for translating new text.

Spoken Dialog Systems
---------------------

In the history of artificial intelligence, the chief measure of intelligence
has been a linguistic one, namely the `Turing Test`:dt:\ : can a dialogue system,
responding to a user's text input, perform so naturally that we cannot distinguish
it from a human-generated response?  In contrast, today's commercial dialogue systems
are very limited, but still perform useful functions in narrowly-defined domains,
as we see here:

| S: How may I help you?
| U: When is Saving Private Ryan playing?
| S: For what theater?
| U: The Paramount theater.
| S: Saving Private Ryan is not playing at the Paramount theater, but
| it's playing at the Madison theater at 3:00, 5:30, 8:00, and 10:30. 

You could not ask this system to provide driving instructions or
details of nearby restaurants unless the required information
had already been stored and suitable question-answer pairs
had been incorporated into the language processing system.

Observe that this system seems to understand the user's goals:
the user asks when a movie is showing and the system
correctly determines from this that the user wants to see
the movie. This inference seems so obvious that you probably
didn't notice it was made, yet a natural language system
needs to be endowed with this capability in order to interact
naturally.  Without it, when asked `Do you know when Saving Private
Ryan is playing?`:lx:, a system might unhelpfully respond with a cold `Yes`:lx:.
However, the developers of commercial dialogue systems use
contextual assumptions and business logic to ensure that the different ways in which a user might
express requests or provide information are handled in a way that
makes sense for the particular application.  So, if you type
`When is ...`:lx:, or `I want to know when ...`:lx:, or `Can you tell me
when ...`:lx:, simple rules will always yield screening times.  This is
enough for the system to provide a useful service.

.. _fig-sds:
.. figure:: ../images/dialogue.png
   :scale: 25:32:30

   Simple Pipeline Architecture for a Spoken Dialogue System:
   Spoken input (top left) is analyzed, words are recognized, sentences are parsed and
   interpreted in context, application-specific actions take place (top right);
   a response is planned, realized as a syntactic structure, then to suitably
   inflected words, and finally to spoken output; different types of
   linguistic knowledge inform each stage of the process.

Dialogue systems give us an opportunity to mention the
commonly assumed pipeline for |NLP|.
fig-sds_ shows the architecture of a simple dialogue system.
Along the top of the diagram, moving from left to right, is a
"pipeline" of some language understanding `components`:dt:.
These map from speech input via syntactic parsing
to some kind of meaning representation.  Along the middle, moving from
right to left, is the reverse pipeline of components for converting
concepts to speech.  These components make up the dynamic aspects of the system.
At the bottom of the diagram are some representative bodies of
static information: the repositories of language-related data that
the processing components draw on to do their work.

.. note:: |TRY|
   For an example of a primitive dialogue system, try having
   a conversation with an NLTK chatbot.  To see the available chatbots,
   run ``nltk.chat.chatbots()``.
   (Remember to ``import nltk`` first.) 

Textual Entailment
------------------

The challenge of language understanding has been brought into focus in recent years by a public
"shared task" called Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE). The basic
scenario is simple.  Suppose you want to find evidence to support
the hypothesis: `Sandra Goudie was defeated by Max Purnell`:lx:, and
that you have another short text that seems to be relevant, for example,
`Sandra Goudie was first elected to Parliament in the 2002 elections,
narrowly winning the seat of Coromandel by defeating Labour candidate
Max Purnell and pushing incumbent Green MP Jeanette Fitzsimons into
third place`:lx:.  Does the text provide enough evidence for you to
accept the hypothesis?  In this particular case, the answer will be "No."
You can draw this conclusion easily, but it is very hard to come up with 
automated methods for making the right decision. The RTE
Challenges provide data that allow competitors to develop their
systems, but not enough data for "brute force" machine learning techniques (a topic
we will cover in chap-data-intensive_\ ).  Consequently, some
linguistic analysis is crucial. In the previous example, it is important
for the system to note that `Sandra Goudie`:lx: names the person being
defeated in the hypothesis, not the person doing the defeating in the
text. As another illustration of the difficulty of the task, consider
the following text-hypothesis pair:

.. ex::
   .. ex:: Text: David Golinkin is the editor or author of eighteen books, and over 150 responsa, articles, sermons and books 
   .. ex:: Hypothesis: Golinkin has written eighteen books

In order to determine whether the hypothesis is supported by the
text, the system needs the following background knowledge:
(i) if someone is an author of a book, then he/she has written that
book; (ii) if someone is an editor of a book, then he/she has not
written (all of) that book; (iii) if someone is editor or author of eighteen
books, then one cannot conclude that he/she is author of eighteen books. 

Limitations of |NLP|
--------------------

Despite the research-led advances in tasks like RTE, natural language
systems that have been deployed for real-world applications still cannot perform
common-sense reasoning or draw on world knowledge in a general and
robust manner.  We can wait for these difficult artificial
intelligence problems to be solved, but in the meantime it is
necessary to live with some severe limitations on the reasoning and
knowledge capabilities of natural language systems. Accordingly, right
from the beginning, an important goal of |NLP| research has been to
make progress on the difficult task of building technologies that
"understand language," using superficial yet powerful techniques instead of
unrestricted knowledge and reasoning capabilities.
Indeed, this is one of the goals of this book, and we hope to equip you with
the knowledge and skills to build useful |NLP| systems, and to
contribute to the long-term aspiration of building intelligent machines.

Summary
-------

* Texts are represented in Python using lists:
  ``['Monty', 'Python']``.  We can use indexing, slicing,
  and the ``len()`` function on lists.
* A word "token" is a particular appearance of a given word in a text;
  a word "type" is the unique form of the word as a particular sequence
  of letters.  We count word tokens using ``len(text)`` and word types using
  ``len(set(text))``. 
* We obtain the vocabulary of a text ``t`` using ``sorted(set(t))``.
* We operate on each item of a text using ``[f(x) for x in text]``. 
* To derive the vocabulary, collapsing case distinctions and ignoring punctuation,
  we can write ``set([w.lower() for w in text if w.isalpha()])``. 
* We process each word in a text using a ``for`` statement, such
  as ``for w in t:`` or ``for word in text:``.  This must be followed by the colon character
  and an indented block of code, to be executed each time through the loop.
* We test a condition using an ``if`` statement: ``if len(word) < 5:``.
  This must be followed by the colon character and an indented block of
  code, to be executed only if the condition is true.
* A frequency distribution is a collection of items along with their frequency counts
  (e.g., the words of a text and their frequency of appearance).
* A function is a block of code that has been assigned a name and can
  be reused. Functions are defined using the ``def`` keyword, as in
  ``def mult(x, y)``; ``x`` and ``y`` are parameters of the function,
  and act as placeholders for actual data values.
* A function is called by specifying its name followed by one or more
  arguments inside parentheses, like this: ``mult(3, 4)``, e.g., ``len(text1)``.

.. TODO: add lots more exercises on lists!

#. |easy| Try using the Python interpreter as a calculator, and
   typing expressions like ``12 / (4 + 1)``.
   
#. |easy| Given an alphabet of 26 letters, there are 26 to the power
   10, or ``26 ** 10``, ten-letter strings we can form.  That works out
   to ``141167095653376L`` (the ``L`` at the end just indicates that
   this is Python's long-number format).  How many hundred-letter
   strings are possible?

#. |easy| The Python multiplication operation can be applied to lists.
   What happens when you type ``['Monty', 'Python'] * 20``,
   or ``3 * sent1``?

   computing with language.  How many words are there in ``text2``?
   How many distinct words are there?

#. |easy| Compare the lexical diversity scores for humor
   and romance fiction in tab-brown-types_.  Which genre is
   more lexically diverse?

#. |easy| Produce a dispersion plot of the four main protagonists in
   *Sense and Sensibility*: Elinor, Marianne, Edward, and Willoughby.

   and females in this novel?  Can you identify the couples?

#. |easy| Find the collocations in ``text5``.

#. |easy| Consider the following Python expression: ``len(set(text4))``.
   State the purpose of this expression.  Describe the two steps
   involved in performing this computation.

#. |easy| Review sec-a-closer-look-at-python-texts-as-lists-of-words_
   on lists and strings.
   
   a) Define a string and assign it to a variable, e.g.,
      ``my_string = 'My String'`` (but put something more interesting in the string).
      Print the contents of this variable in two ways, first
      by simply typing the variable name and pressing enter, then
      by using the ``print`` statement.
   
   b) Try adding the string to itself using ``my_string + my_string``, or multiplying
      it by a number, e.g., ``my_string * 3``.  Notice that the strings
      are joined together without any spaces.  How could you fix this?

#. |easy| Define a variable ``my_sent`` to be a list of words, using
   the syntax ``my_sent = ["My", "sent"]`` (but with your own words,
   or a favorite saying).
   
   a) Use ``' '.join(my_sent)`` to convert this into a string.
   b) Use ``split()`` to split the string back into the list form
      you had to start with.

#. |easy| Define several variables containing lists of words, e.g., ``phrase1``,
   ``phrase2``, and so on.  Join them together in various combinations (using the plus operator)
   to form whole sentences.  What is the relationship between
   ``len(phrase1 + phrase2)`` and ``len(phrase1) + len(phrase2)``?

#. |easy| Consider the following two expressions, which have the same
   value.  Which one will typically be more relevant in |NLP|?  Why?

   a) ``"Monty Python"[6:12]``
   b) ``["Monty", "Python"][1]``

#. |easy| We have seen how to represent a sentence as a list of words, where
   each word is a sequence of characters.  What does ``sent1[2][2]`` do?
   Why?  Experiment with other index values.

#. |easy| The first sentence of ``text3`` is provided to you in the
   variable ``sent3``.  The index of `the`:lx: in ``sent3`` is 1, because ``sent3[1]``
   gives us ``'the'``.  What are the indexes of the two other occurrences
   of this word in ``sent3``?

#. |easy| Review the discussion of conditionals in sec-making-decisions_.
   Find all words in the Chat Corpus (``text5``)
   starting with the letter `b`:lx:.  Show them in alphabetical order.

#. |easy| Type the expression ``range(10)`` at the interpreter prompt.
   Now try ``range(10, 20)``, ``range(10, 20, 2)``, and ``range(20, 10, -2)``.
   We will see a variety of uses for this built-in function in later chapters.

#. |soso| Use ``text9.index()`` to find the index of the word `sunset`:lx:.
   You'll need to insert this word as an argument between the parentheses.
   By a process of trial and error, find the slice for the complete sentence that
   contains this word.

#. |soso| Using list addition, and the ``set`` and ``sorted`` operations, compute the
   vocabulary of the sentences ``sent1`` ... ``sent8``.

#. |soso| What is the difference between the following two lines?
   Which one will give a larger value?  Will this be the case for other texts?
   
   .. doctest-ignore::
       >>> sorted(set([w.lower() for w in text1]))
       >>> sorted([w.lower() for w in set(text1)])  

#. |soso| What is the difference between the following two tests:
   ``w.isupper()`` and ``not w.islower()``?

#. |soso| Write the slice expression that extracts the last two words of ``text2``.

#. |soso| Find all the four-letter words in the Chat Corpus (``text5``).
   With the help of a frequency distribution (``FreqDist``), show these
   words in decreasing order of frequency.

#. |soso| Review the discussion of looping with conditions in sec-making-decisions_.
   Use a combination of ``for`` and ``if`` statements to loop over the words of
   the movie script for *Monty Python and the Holy Grail* (``text6``)
   and ``print`` all the uppercase words, one per line.

#. |soso| Write expressions for finding all words in ``text6`` that
   meet the following conditions.  The result should be in the form of
   a list of words: ``['word1', 'word2', ...]``.
   
   a) Ending in `ize`:lx:
   b) Containing the letter `z`:lx:
   c) Containing the sequence of letters `pt`:lx:
   d) All lowercase letters except for an initial capital (i.e., ``titlecase``)

#. |soso| Define ``sent`` to be the list of words
   ``['she', 'sells', 'sea', 'shells', 'by', 'the', 'sea', 'shore']``.
   Now write code to perform the following tasks:

   a) Print all words beginning with `sh`:lx:
   b) Print all words longer than four characters

#. |soso| What does the following Python code do?  ``sum([len(w) for w in text1])``
   Can you use it to work out the average word length of a text?

#. |soso| Define a function called ``vocab_size(text)`` that has a single
   parameter for the text, and which returns the vocabulary size of the text.

#. |soso| Define a function ``percent(word, text)`` that calculates
   how often a given word occurs in a text, and expresses the result
   as a percentage.

#. |soso| We have been using sets to store vocabularies.  Try the following
   Python expression: ``set(sent3) < set(text1)``.  Experiment with this using
   different arguments to ``set()``.  What does it do?
   Can you think of a practical application for this?
