Preface

|nopar|
This is a book about Natural Language Processing. By "natural
language" we mean a language that is used for everyday
communication by humans; languages like English, Hindi or
Portuguese. In contrast to artificial languages such as
programming languages and mathematical notations, natural languages have
evolved as they pass from generation to generation, and are hard to
pin down with explicit rules. We will take Natural Language Processing |mdash| or |NLP|
for short |mdash| in a wide sense to cover any kind of computer manipulation
of natural language. At one extreme, it could be as simple as counting
word frequencies to compare different writing styles.
At the other extreme, |NLP| involves "understanding" complete human
utterances, at least to the extent of being able to give useful
responses to them.  

Technologies based on |NLP|
are becoming increasingly widespread. For example, phones and handheld computers
support predictive text and handwriting recognition;  web
search engines give access to information locked up in unstructured
text; machine translation allows us to retrieve texts written in
Chinese and read them in Spanish.  By providing more natural human-machine interfaces, and more
sophisticated access to stored information, language processing has
come to play a central role in the multilingual information society.

This book provides a highly accessible introduction to the field of |NLP|.
It can be used for individual study or as the textbook for a course
on natural language processing or computational linguistics,
or as a supplement to courses in artificial intelligence,
text mining, or corpus linguistics.
The book is intensely practical, containing 
hundreds of fully-worked examples and graded exercises.

The book is based on the Python programming language together with an open source
library called the *Natural Language Toolkit* (|NLTK|).
|NLTK| includes extensive software, data, and documentation, all freely downloadable from |NLTK-URL|.
Distributions are provided for Windows, Macintosh and Unix platforms.
We strongly encourage you to download Python and |NLTK|, and try out the
examples and exercises along the way.

--------
Audience
--------

|NLP| is important for scientific, economic, social, and cultural reasons.
|NLP| is experiencing rapid growth as its theories and methods are deployed in
a variety of new language technologies.  For this reason it is
important for a wide range of people to have a working knowledge of |NLP|.
Within industry, this includes people in
human-computer interaction, business information analysis,
and web software development.
Within academia, it includes people in areas from
humanities computing and corpus linguistics
through to computer science and artificial intelligence.
(To many people in academia, |NLP| is known by the name of
"Computational Linguistics.")

This book is intended for a diverse range of people who want to
learn how to write programs that analyze written language,
regardless of previous programming experience:

:New to programming?:  The early chapters of the book are suitable
    for readers with no prior knowledge of programming, so long as you
    aren't afraid to tackle new concepts and develop new computing skills.
    The book is full of examples that you can copy and
    try for yourself, together with hundreds of graded exercises.
    If you need a more general introduction to Python, see the
    list of Python resources at ``http://docs.python.org/``.

:New to Python?:  Experienced programmers can quickly learn enough
    Python using this book to get immersed in natural language processing.
    All relevant Python features are carefully explained and exemplified,
    and you will quickly come to appreciate Python's suitability for this
    application area.  The language index will help you locate relevant
    discussions in the book.

:Already dreaming in Python?:  Skim the Python examples
    and dig into the interesting language analysis
    material that starts in chap-introduction_.
    You'll soon be applying your skills to this fascinating domain.

--------
Emphasis
--------

This book is a *practical* introduction to |NLP|.  You will learn by
example, write real programs, and grasp the value of being able to
test an idea through implementation.  If you haven't learnt already,
this book will teach you *programming*.  Unlike other programming
books, we provide extensive illustrations and exercises from |NLP|.  The
approach we have taken is also *principled*, in that we cover the
theoretical underpinnings and don't shy away from careful linguistic
and computational analysis.  We have tried to be *pragmatic* in
striking a balance between theory and application, identifying the
connections and the tensions.  Finally, we recognize that you
won't get through this unless it is also *pleasurable*, so we have
tried to include many applications and examples that are interesting
and entertaining, sometimes whimsical.

Note that this book is not a reference work.  Its coverage of Python
and |NLP| is selective, and presented in a tutorial style.  For
reference material, please consult the substantial quantity of
searchable resources available at |PYTHON-URL| and |NLTK-URL|.

This book is not an advanced computer science text.
The content ranges from introductory to intermediate, and is
directed at readers who want to learn how to analyze
text using Python and the Natural Language Toolkit.
To learn about advanced algorithms implemented in |NLTK|,
you can examine the Python code linked from |NLTK-URL|,
and consult the other materials cited in this book.

------------
Organization
------------

The early chapters are organized in order of conceptual difficulty,
starting with a practical introduction to language processing
that shows how to explore interesting bodies of text using
tiny Python programs (Chapters 1-3).  This is followed by
a chapter on structured programming (Chapter 4) that consolidates the
programming topics scattered across the preceding chapters.
After this, the pace picks up, and we move
on to a series of chapters covering fundamental topics in
language processing:
tagging, classification, and information extraction (Chapters 5-7).
The next three chapters look at ways to parse a sentence, recognize
its syntactic structure, and construct representations of meaning (Chapters 8-10).
The final chapter is devoted to linguistic data and how it can
be managed effectively (Chapter 11).  The book concludes with an
Afterword, briefly discussing the past and future of the field.

Within each chapter, we switch between different styles of presentation.
In one style, natural language is the driver.  We analyze language,
explore linguistic concepts, and use programming examples to support
the discussion.  We often employ Python constructs that have
not been introduced systematically, so you can see their purpose
before delving into the details of how and why they work.
This is just like learning idiomatic expressions in a foreign language:
you're able to buy a nice pastry without first having learnt
the intricacies of question formation.
In the other style of presentation, the programming language will be the driver.
We'll analyze programs, explore algorithms, and the linguistic examples
will play a supporting role.

Each chapter ends with a series of graded exercises,
which are useful for consolidating the material.
The exercises are graded according to the following scheme:
|easy| is for easy exercises that involve minor modifications
to supplied code samples or other simple activities;
|soso| is for intermediate exercises that explore an aspect
of the material in more depth, requiring careful analysis and design;
|hard| is for difficult, open-ended tasks that will challenge your
understanding of the material and force you to think independently
(readers new to programming should skip these).

Each chapter has a further reading section and an online "extras"
section at |NLTK-URL|, with pointers to more advanced materials and
online resources.  Online versions of all the code examples are also
available there.

-----------
Why Python?
-----------

Python is a simple yet powerful programming language with excellent
functionality for processing linguistic data.  Python can be
downloaded for free from ``http://www.python.org/``.
Installers are available for all platforms.

Here is a five-line Python program that processes ``file.txt``
and prints all the words ending in ``ing``:

.. doctest-ignore::
    >>> for line in open("file.txt"):
    ...     for word in line.split():
    ...         if word.endswith('ing'):
    ...             print word

This program illustrates some of the main features of Python.  First,
whitespace is used to *nest* lines of code, thus the line starting
with ``if`` falls inside the scope of the previous line starting with
``for``; this ensures that the ``ing`` test is performed for each
word.  Second, Python is *object-oriented*; each variable is an entity
that has certain defined attributes and methods.  For example, the
value of the variable ``line`` is more than a sequence of characters.
It is a string object that has a "method" (or operation) called
``split()`` that we can use to break a line into its words.  To apply
a method to an object, we write the object name, followed by a period,
followed by the method name, i.e. ``line.split()``.  Third, methods
have *arguments* expressed inside parentheses.  For instance, in the
example, ``word.endswith('ing')`` had the argument ``'ing'`` to
indicate that we wanted words ending with `ing`:lx: and not something else. 
Finally |mdash| and most importantly |mdash|
Python is highly readable, so much so that it is fairly easy to guess
what the program does even if you have never written a program
before.

We chose Python because it has a shallow learning curve,
its syntax and semantics are transparent,
and it has good string-handling functionality.  As an interpreted
language, Python facilitates interactive exploration.  As an
object-oriented language, Python permits data and methods to be
encapsulated and re-used easily.  As a dynamic language, Python
permits attributes to be added to objects on the fly, and permits
variables to be typed dynamically, facilitating rapid development.
Python comes with an extensive
standard library, including components for graphical programming,
numerical processing, and web connectivity.

Python is heavily used in industry, scientific research, and education
around the world.  Python is often praised for the way it facilitates
productivity, quality, and maintainability of software.  A collection of
Python success stories is posted at ``http://www.python.org/about/success/``.

|NLTK| defines an infrastructure that can be used to build |NLP|
programs in Python.  It provides
basic classes for representing data relevant to natural language processing;
standard interfaces for performing tasks such as
part-of-speech tagging, syntactic parsing, and text classification;
and standard implementations for each task which can be combined to solve complex problems.

|NLTK| comes with extensive documentation. In addition to this 
book, the website at |NLTK-URL| provides API documentation
that covers every module, class and function in the toolkit,
specifying parameters and giving examples of usage. 
The website also provides many HOWTOs with extensive
examples and test cases, intended for users, developers and instructors.

Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
-------------------------------

|NLTK| was originally created in 2001 as part of a computational linguistics
course in the Department of Computer and Information Science at the
University of Pennsylvania.  Since then it has been developed
and expanded with the help of dozens of contributors.  It has now been
adopted in courses in dozens of universities, and serves as the basis
of many research projects.  See tab-modules_ for a list of the most
important |NLTK| modules.

   ===========================  ===========================  ============================================================

   Language processing tasks and corresponding NLTK modules with examples of functionality

|NLTK| was designed with four primary goals in mind:

:Simplicity: To provide an intuitive framework along with
    substantial building blocks, giving users a practical
    knowledge of |NLP| without getting bogged down in the tedious
    house-keeping usually associated with processing annotated
    language data
:Consistency: To provide a uniform framework with consistent
    interfaces and data structures, and easily-guessable method names
:Extensibility: To provide a structure into which new software
    modules can be easily accommodated, including alternative
    implementations and competing approaches to the same task
:Modularity: To provide components that can be used
    independently without needing to understand the rest of
    the toolkit

Contrasting with these goals are three non-requirements |mdash|
potentially useful qualities that we have deliberately avoided.  First,
while the toolkit provides a wide range of functions, it is not
encyclopedic; it is a toolkit, not a system, and it will
continue to evolve with the field of |NLP|. 
Second, while the toolkit is efficient enough to support
meaningful tasks, it is not highly optimized for runtime performance;
such optimizations often involve more complex algorithms,
or implementations in lower-level programming languages such as C or C++.
This would make the software less readable and more difficult to install.
Third, we have tried to avoid clever programming tricks,
since we believe that clear implementations are preferable
to ingenious yet indecipherable ones.


---------------
For Instructors
---------------

Natural Language Processing is often taught within the
confines of a single-semester course at advanced undergraduate level
or postgraduate level.  Many instructors have found that it is
difficult to cover both the theoretical and practical sides of the
subject in such a short span of time.  Some courses focus on theory to
the exclusion of practical exercises, and deprive students of the
challenge and excitement of writing programs to automatically process
language.  Other courses are simply designed to teach programming for
linguists, and do not manage to cover any significant |NLP| content.
|NLTK| was originally developed to address this problem,
making it feasible to cover a substantial amount of theory and
practice within a single-semester course, even if students have no
prior programming experience.
    
A significant fraction of any |NLP| syllabus deals with
algorithms and data structures.  On their own these can be rather
dry, but |NLTK| brings them to life with the help of  
interactive graphical user interfaces that make it possible
to view algorithms step-by-step.  Most |NLTK| components include
a demonstration that performs an interesting task without
requiring any special input from the user.
An effective way to deliver the materials is through interactive
presentation of the examples in this book, entering them in a Python session,
observing what they do, and modifying them to explore some empirical
or theoretical issue.

This book contains hundreds of exercises that can be used
as the basis for student assignments.  The simplest exercises involve
modifying a supplied program fragment in a specified way in order to
answer a concrete question.  At the other end of the spectrum, |NLTK|
provides a flexible framework for graduate-level research projects,
with standard implementations of all the basic data structures
and algorithms, interfaces to dozens of widely used datasets (corpora),
and a flexible and extensible architecture.  Additional support for
teaching using |NLTK| is available on the |NLTK| website.

|nopar|  
We believe this book is unique in providing a comprehensive
framework for students to learn about |NLP| in the context of learning
to program.  What sets these
materials apart is the tight coupling of the chapters
and exercises with |NLTK|, giving students |mdash| even those with
no prior programming experience |mdash| a practical introduction to
|NLP|.  After completing these materials, students will be ready to
attempt one of the more advanced textbooks, such as *Speech and
Language Processing*, by Jurafsky and Martin (Prentice Hall, 2008).

This book presents programming concepts in an unusual order, beginning
with a non-trivial data type |mdash| lists of strings |mdash| then introducing
non-trivial control structures such as comprehensions and conditionals.
These idioms permit us to do useful language processing from the start.
Once this motivation is in place, we return to a systematic presentation
of fundamental concepts such as strings, loops, files, and so forth.
In this way, we cover the same ground as more conventional approaches,
without expecting readers to be interested in the programming
language for its own sake.

Two possible course plans are illustrated in tab-course-plans_.  The first
one presumes an arts/humanities audience, whereas the second one presumes
a science/engineering audience.  Other course plans could cover the first
five chapters, then devote the remaining time of time to a single area,
such as text classification (Chapters 6-7), syntax (Chapters 8-9),
semantics (Chapter 10), or linguistic data management (Chapter 11).
