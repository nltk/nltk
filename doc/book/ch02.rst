2. Accessing Text Corpora and Lexical Resources
===============================================

Practical work in Natural Language Processing typically uses
large bodies of linguistic data, or `corpora`:dt:.
The goal of this chapter is to answer the following questions:

#. What are some useful text corpora and lexical resources, and how can we access them with Python?
#. Which Python constructs are most helpful for this work?
#. How do we avoid repeating ourselves when writing Python code?

This chapter continues to present programming concepts by example, in the
context of a linguistic processing task.  We will wait until later before
exploring each Python construct systematically.  Don't worry if you see
an example that contains something unfamiliar; simply try it out and see
what it does, and |mdash| if you're game |mdash| modify it by substituting
some part of the code with a different text or word.  This way you will
associate a task with a programming idiom, and learn the hows and whys later.


.. _sec-extracting-text-from-corpora:

----------------------
Accessing Text Corpora
----------------------

As just mentioned, a text corpus is a large body of text. Many
corpora are designed to contain a careful balance of material
in one or more genres.  We examined some small text collections in
chap-introduction_, such as the speeches known as the US Presidential
Inaugural Addresses.  This particular corpus actually contains dozens
of individual texts |mdash| one per address |mdash| but for convenience
we glued them end-to-end and treated them as a single text.
chap-introduction_ also used various pre-defined texts that
we accessed by typing ``from book import *``.  However, since we want
to be able to work with other texts, this section examines a
variety of text corpora. We'll see how
to select individual texts, and how to work with them.

Gutenberg Corpus
----------------

|NLTK| includes a small selection of texts from the Project Gutenberg
electronic text archive, which contains
some 25,000 free electronic books, hosted at ``http://www.gutenberg.org/``.  We begin
by getting the Python interpreter to load the |NLTK| package,
then ask to see ``nltk.corpus.gutenberg.fileids()``, the file identifiers in
this corpus:

    >>> import nltk
    >>> nltk.corpus.gutenberg.fileids()
    ['austen-emma.txt', 'austen-persuasion.txt', 'austen-sense.txt', 'bible-kjv.txt',
    'blake-poems.txt', 'bryant-stories.txt', 'burgess-busterbrown.txt',
    'carroll-alice.txt', 'chesterton-ball.txt', 'chesterton-brown.txt',
    'chesterton-thursday.txt', 'edgeworth-parents.txt', 'melville-moby_dick.txt',
    'milton-paradise.txt', 'shakespeare-caesar.txt', 'shakespeare-hamlet.txt',
    'shakespeare-macbeth.txt', 'whitman-leaves.txt']

Let's pick out the first of these texts |mdash| *Emma* by Jane Austen |mdash| and
give it a short name, ``emma``, then find out how many words it contains: 

    >>> emma = nltk.corpus.gutenberg.words('austen-emma.txt')
    >>> len(emma)
    192427

.. note::

   In sec-computing-with-language-texts-and-words_, we showed how you
   could carry out concordancing of a text such as ``text1`` with the
   command ``text1.concordance()``. However, this assumes that you are
   using one of the nine texts obtained as a result of doing ``from
   nltk.book import *``. Now that you have started examining data from
   ``nltk.corpus``, as in the previous example, you have to employ the
   following pair of statements to perform concordancing and other
   tasks from sec-computing-with-language-texts-and-words_:

   .. doctest-ignore::
       >>> emma = nltk.Text(nltk.corpus.gutenberg.words('austen-emma.txt'))
       >>> emma.concordance("surprize")

When we defined ``emma``, we invoked the ``words()`` function of the ``gutenberg``
object in |NLTK|\ 's ``corpus`` package.
But since it is cumbersome to type such long names all the time, Python provides
another version of the ``import`` statement, as follows:

    >>> from nltk.corpus import gutenberg
    >>> gutenberg.fileids()
    ['austen-emma.txt', 'austen-persuasion.txt', 'austen-sense.txt', ...]
    >>> emma = gutenberg.words('austen-emma.txt')

Let's write a short program to display other information about each
text, by looping over all the values of ``fileid`` corresponding to
the ``gutenberg`` file identifiers listed earlier and then computing
statistics for each text.  For a compact output display, we will make
sure that the numbers are all integers, using ``int()``.

    >>> for fileid in gutenberg.fileids():
    ...     num_chars = len(gutenberg.raw(fileid)) # [_raw-access]
    ...     num_words = len(gutenberg.words(fileid))
    ...     num_sents = len(gutenberg.sents(fileid))
    ...     num_vocab = len(set([w.lower() for w in gutenberg.words(fileid)]))
    ...     print int(num_chars/num_words), int(num_words/num_sents), int(num_words/num_vocab), fileid
    ... 
    4 21 26 austen-emma.txt
    4 23 16 austen-persuasion.txt
    4 24 22 austen-sense.txt
    4 33 79 bible-kjv.txt
    4 18 5 blake-poems.txt
    4 17 14 bryant-stories.txt
    4 17 12 burgess-busterbrown.txt
    4 16 12 carroll-alice.txt
    4 17 11 chesterton-ball.txt
    4 19 11 chesterton-brown.txt
    4 16 10 chesterton-thursday.txt
    4 18 24 edgeworth-parents.txt
    4 24 15 melville-moby_dick.txt
    4 52 10 milton-paradise.txt
    4 12 8 shakespeare-caesar.txt
    4 13 7 shakespeare-hamlet.txt
    4 13 6 shakespeare-macbeth.txt
    4 35 12 whitman-leaves.txt

This program displays three statistics for each text:
average word length, average sentence length, and the number of times each vocabulary
item appears in the text on average (our lexical diversity score).
Observe that average word length appears to be a general property of English, since
it has a recurrent value of ``4``.  (In fact, the average word length is really
``3`` not ``4``, since the ``num_chars`` variable counts space characters.)
By contrast average sentence length and lexical diversity
appear to be characteristics of particular authors.

The previous example also showed how we can access the "raw" text of the book raw-access_,
not split up into tokens.  The ``raw()`` function gives us the contents of the file
without any linguistic processing.  So, for example, ``len(gutenberg.raw('blake-poems.txt')``
tells us how many *letters* occur in the text, including the spaces between words.
The ``sents()`` function divides the text up into its sentences, where each sentence is
a list of words:

    >>> macbeth_sentences = gutenberg.sents('shakespeare-macbeth.txt')
    >>> macbeth_sentences
    [['[', 'The', 'Tragedie', 'of', 'Macbeth', 'by', 'William', 'Shakespeare',
    '1603', ']'], ['Actus', 'Primus', '.'], ...]
    >>> macbeth_sentences[1037]
    ['Double', ',', 'double', ',', 'toile', 'and', 'trouble', ';',
    'Fire', 'burne', ',', 'and', 'Cauldron', 'bubble']
    >>> longest_len = max([len(s) for s in macbeth_sentences])
    >>> [s for s in macbeth_sentences if len(s) == longest_len]
    [['Doubtfull', 'it', 'stood', ',', 'As', 'two', 'spent', 'Swimmers', ',', 'that',
    'doe', 'cling', 'together', ',', 'And', 'choake', 'their', 'Art', ':', 'The',
    'mercilesse', 'Macdonwald', ...], ...]

.. note::
   Most |NLTK| corpus readers include a variety of access methods
   apart from ``words()``, ``raw()``, and ``sents()``.  Richer
   linguistic content is available from some corpora, such as part-of-speech
   tags, dialogue tags, syntactic trees, and so forth; we will see these
   in later chapters.

Web and Chat Text
-----------------

Although Project Gutenberg contains thousands of books, it represents established
literature.  It is important to consider less formal language as well.  |NLTK|\ 's
small collection of web text includes content from a Firefox discussion forum,
conversations overheard in New York, the movie script of *Pirates of the Carribean*,
personal advertisements, and wine reviews:

    >>> from nltk.corpus import webtext
    >>> for fileid in webtext.fileids():
    ...     print fileid, webtext.raw(fileid)[:65], '...'
    ...

There is also a corpus of instant messaging chat sessions, originally collected
by the Naval Postgraduate School for research on automatic detection of Internet predators.
The corpus contains over 10,000 posts, anonymized by replacing usernames with generic
names of the form "UserNNN", and manually edited to remove any other identifying information.
The corpus is organized into 15 files, where each file contains several hundred posts
collected on a given date, for an age-specific chatroom (teens, 20s, 30s, 40s, plus a
generic adults chatroom).  The filename contains the date, chatroom,
and number of posts; e.g., ``10-19-20s_706posts.xml`` contains 706 posts gathered from
the 20s chat room on 10/19/2006.

    >>> from nltk.corpus import nps_chat 
    >>> chatroom = nps_chat.posts('10-19-20s_706posts.xml')
    >>> chatroom[123]
    ['i', 'do', "n't", 'want', 'hot', 'pics', 'of', 'a', 'female', ',',
    'I', 'can', 'look', 'in', 'a', 'mirror', '.']

Brown Corpus
------------

The Brown Corpus was the first million-word electronic
corpus of English, created in 1961 at Brown University.
This corpus contains text from 500 sources, and the sources
have been categorized by genre, such as *news*, *editorial*, and so on.
tab-brown-sources_ gives an example of each genre
(for a complete list, see ``http://icame.uib.no/brown/bcm-los.html``).

  Example Document for Each Section of the Brown Corpus

We can access the corpus as a list of words, or a list of sentences (where each sentence
is itself just a list of words).  We can optionally specify particular categories or files to read:

    >>> from nltk.corpus import brown
    >>> brown.categories()
    ['adventure', 'belles_lettres', 'editorial', 'fiction', 'government', 'hobbies',
    'humor', 'learned', 'lore', 'mystery', 'news', 'religion', 'reviews', 'romance',
    'science_fiction']
    >>> brown.words(categories='news')
    ['The', 'Fulton', 'County', 'Grand', 'Jury', 'said', ...]
    >>> brown.words(fileids=['cg22'])
    ['Does', 'our', 'society', 'have', 'a', 'runaway', ',', ...]
    >>> brown.sents(categories=['news', 'editorial', 'reviews'])
    [['The', 'Fulton', 'County'...], ['The', 'jury', 'further'...], ...]

The Brown Corpus is a convenient resource for studying systematic differences between
genres, a kind of linguistic inquiry known as `stylistics`:dt:.
Let's compare genres in their usage of modal verbs.  The first step
is to produce the counts for a particular genre.  Remember to
``import nltk`` before doing the following:

    >>> from nltk.corpus import brown
    >>> news_text = brown.words(categories='news')
    >>> fdist = nltk.FreqDist([w.lower() for w in news_text])
    >>> modals = ['can', 'could', 'may', 'might', 'must', 'will']
    >>> for m in modals:
    ...     print m + ':', fdist[m],
    ...
    can: 94 could: 87 may: 93 might: 38 must: 53 will: 389

.. note:: |TRY|
   Choose a different section of the Brown Corpus, and adapt the previous
   example to count a selection of `wh`:lx: words, such as `what`:lx:,
   `when`:lx:, `where`:lx:, `who`:lx:, and `why`:lx:.

Next, we need to obtain counts for each genre of interest.  We'll use
|NLTK|\ 's support for conditional frequency distributions. These are
presented systematically in sec-conditional-frequency-distributions_,
where we also unpick the following code line by line. For the moment,
you can ignore the details and just concentrate on the output.

    >>> cfd = nltk.ConditionalFreqDist(
    ...           (genre, word)
    ...           for genre in brown.categories()
    ...           for word in brown.words(categories=genre))
    >>> genres = ['news', 'religion', 'hobbies', 'science_fiction', 'romance', 'humor']
    >>> modals = ['can', 'could', 'may', 'might', 'must', 'will']
    >>> cfd.tabulate(conditions=genres, samples=modals)
                     can could  may might must will
               news   93   86   66   38   50  389
           religion   82   59   78   12   54   71
            hobbies  268   58  131   22   83  264
    science_fiction   16   49    4   12    8   16
            romance   74  193   11   51   45   43
              humor   16   30    8    8    9   13

Observe that the most frequent modal in the news genre is `will`:lx:,
while the most frequent modal in the romance genre is `could`:lx:.
Would you have predicted this?  The idea that word counts
might distinguish genres will be taken up again in chap-data-intensive_.

.. XXX xref isn't being handled?

Reuters Corpus
--------------

The Reuters Corpus contains 10,788 news documents totaling 1.3 million words.
The documents have been classified into 90 topics, and grouped
into two sets, called "training" and "test"; thus, the text with
fileid ``'test/14826'`` is a document drawn from the test set. This split is for
training and testing algorithms that automatically detect the topic of a document,
as we will see in chap-data-intensive_.

    >>> from nltk.corpus import reuters
    >>> reuters.fileids()
    ['test/14826', 'test/14828', 'test/14829', 'test/14832', ...]
    >>> reuters.categories() 
    ['acq', 'alum', 'barley', 'bop', 'carcass', 'castor-oil', 'cocoa',
    'coconut', 'coconut-oil', 'coffee', 'copper', 'copra-cake', 'corn',
    'cotton', 'cotton-oil', 'cpi', 'cpu', 'crude', 'dfl', 'dlr', ...]

Unlike the Brown Corpus, categories in the Reuters corpus overlap with
each other, simply because a news story often covers multiple topics.
We can ask for the topics covered by one or more documents, or for the
documents included in one or more categories. For convenience, the
corpus methods accept a single fileid or a list of fileids.

    >>> reuters.categories('training/9865')
    ['barley', 'corn', 'grain', 'wheat']
    >>> reuters.categories(['training/9865', 'training/9880'])
    ['barley', 'corn', 'grain', 'money-fx', 'wheat']
    >>> reuters.fileids('barley') 
    ['test/15618', 'test/15649', 'test/15676', 'test/15728', 'test/15871', ...]
    >>> reuters.fileids(['barley', 'corn']) 
    ['test/14832', 'test/14858', 'test/15033', 'test/15043', 'test/15106',
    'test/15287', 'test/15341', 'test/15618', 'test/15618', 'test/15648', ...]


Similarly, we can specify the words or sentences we want in terms of
files or categories. The first handful of words in each of these texts are the
titles, which by convention are stored as upper case.

    >>> reuters.words('training/9865')[:14]
    ['FRENCH', 'FREE', 'MARKET', 'CEREAL', 'EXPORT', 'BIDS',
    'DETAILED', 'French', 'operators', 'have', 'requested', 'licences', 'to', 'export'] 
    >>> reuters.words(['training/9865', 'training/9880'])
    ['FRENCH', 'FREE', 'MARKET', 'CEREAL', 'EXPORT', ...]
    >>> reuters.words(categories='barley')
    ['FRENCH', 'FREE', 'MARKET', 'CEREAL', 'EXPORT', ...]
    >>> reuters.words(categories=['barley', 'corn'])
    ['THAI', 'TRADE', 'DEFICIT', 'WIDENS', 'IN', 'FIRST', ...]

Inaugural Address Corpus 
------------------------

.. XXX fig-inaugural_ isn't being handled correctly in the output

In sec-computing-with-language-texts-and-words_, we looked at
the Inaugural Address Corpus,
but treated it as a single text.  The graph in fig-inaugural_
used "word offset" as one of the axes; this is the numerical index of the
word in the corpus, counting from the first word of the first address.
However, the corpus is actually a collection of 55 texts, one for each presidential address.
An interesting property of this collection is its time dimension:

    >>> from nltk.corpus import inaugural
    >>> inaugural.fileids()
    ['1789-Washington.txt', '1793-Washington.txt', '1797-Adams.txt', ...]
    >>> [fileid[:4] for fileid in inaugural.fileids()]
    ['1789', '1793', '1797', '1801', '1805', '1809', '1813', '1817', '1821', ...]

Notice that the year of each text appears in its filename.  To get the year
out of the filename, we extracted the first four characters, using ``fileid[:4]``.

Let's look at how the words `America`:lx: and `citizen`:lx: are used over time.
The following code
converts the words in the Inaugural corpus 
to lowercase using ``w.lower()`` lowercase-startswith_,
then checks if they start with either of the "targets"
``america`` or ``citizen`` using ``startswith()`` lowercase-startswith_.
Thus it will count words like `American's`:lx: and `Citizens`:lx:.
We'll learn about conditional frequency distributions in
sec-conditional-frequency-distributions_; for now just consider
the output, shown in fig-inaugural2_.

.. doctest-ignore::
    >>> cfd = nltk.ConditionalFreqDist(
    ...           (target, fileid[:4])
    ...           for fileid in inaugural.fileids()
    ...           for w in inaugural.words(fileid)
    ...           for target in ['america', 'citizen']
    ...           if w.lower().startswith(target)) # [_lowercase-startswith]
    >>> cfd.plot()

.. _fig-inaugural2:
.. figure:: ../images/inaugural2.png
   :scale: 18:22:20

   Plot of a Conditional Frequency Distribution: all words in the Inaugural Address
   Corpus that begin with ``america`` or ``citizen`` are counted; separate counts
   are kept for each address; these are plotted so that trends in usage over time can
   be observed; counts are not normalized for document length.

Annotated Text Corpora
----------------------

Many text corpora contain linguistic annotations, representing POS tags,
named entities, syntactic structures, semantic roles, and so forth.  NLTK provides
convenient ways to access several of these corpora, and has data packages containing corpora
and corpus samples, freely downloadable for use in teaching and research.
tab-corpora_ lists some of the corpora.  For information about
downloading them, see ``http://www.nltk.org/data``.

   Some of the Corpora and Corpus Samples Distributed with NLTK: For information about downloading
   and using them, please consult the NLTK website.


Corpora in Other Languages
--------------------------

NLTK comes with corpora for many languages, though in some cases
you will need to learn how to manipulate character encodings in Python
before using these corpora (see sec-unicode_).

    >>> nltk.corpus.cess_esp.words()
    ['El', 'grupo', 'estatal', 'Electricit\xe9_de_France', ...]
    >>> nltk.corpus.floresta.words()
    ['Um', 'revivalismo', 'refrescante', 'O', '7_e_Meio', ...]
    >>> nltk.corpus.indian.words('hindi.pos')
    ['\xe0\xa4\xaa\xe0\xa5\x82\xe0\xa4\xb0\xe0\xa5\x8d\xe0\xa4\xa3',
    '\xe0\xa4\xaa\xe0\xa5\x8d\xe0\xa4\xb0\xe0\xa4\xa4\xe0\xa4\xbf\xe0\xa4\xac\xe0\xa4
    \x82\xe0\xa4\xa7', ...]
    >>> nltk.corpus.udhr.fileids()
    ['Abkhaz-Cyrillic+Abkh', 'Abkhaz-UTF8', 'Achehnese-Latin1', 'Achuar-Shiwiar-Latin1',
    'Adja-UTF8', 'Afaan_Oromo_Oromiffa-Latin1', 'Afrikaans-Latin1', 'Aguaruna-Latin1',
    'Akuapem_Twi-UTF8', 'Albanian_Shqip-Latin1', 'Amahuaca', 'Amahuaca-Latin1', ...]
    >>> nltk.corpus.udhr.words('Javanese-Latin1')[11:]
    [u'Saben', u'umat', u'manungsa', u'lair', u'kanthi', ...]

The last of these corpora, ``udhr``, contains the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
in over 300 languages.  The fileids for this corpus include
information about the character encoding used in the file,
such as ``UTF8`` or ``Latin1``.
Let's use a conditional frequency distribution to examine the differences in word lengths
for a selection of languages included in the ``udhr`` corpus.
The output is shown in fig-word-len-dist_ (run the program yourself to see a color plot).
Note that ``True`` and ``False`` are Python's built-in boolean values.

.. doctest-ignore::
    >>> from nltk.corpus import udhr
    >>> languages = ['Chickasaw', 'English', 'German_Deutsch',
    ...     'Greenlandic_Inuktikut', 'Hungarian_Magyar', 'Ibibio_Efik']
    >>> cfd = nltk.ConditionalFreqDist(
    ...           (lang, len(word))
    ...           for lang in languages
    ...           for word in udhr.words(lang + '-Latin1'))
    >>> cfd.plot(cumulative=True)

.. _fig-word-len-dist:
.. figure:: ../images/word-len-dist.png
   :scale: 25

   Cumulative Word Length Distributions:
   Six translations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are processed;
   this graph shows that words having 5 or fewer letters account for about
   80% of Ibibio text, 60% of German text, and 25% of Inuktitut text. 

.. XXX In the following, nltk.FreqDist got wrapped weirdly (as FreqD-ist)

.. note:: |TRY|
   Pick a language of interest in ``udhr.fileids()``, and define a variable
   ``raw_text = udhr.raw(``\ *Language-Latin1*\ ``)``.  Now plot a frequency
   distribution of the letters of the text using ``nltk.FreqDist(raw_text).plot()``.

Unfortunately, for many languages, substantial corpora are not yet available.  Often there is
insufficient government or industrial support for developing language resources, and individual
efforts are piecemeal and hard to discover or re-use.  Some languages have no
established writing system, or are endangered.  (See sec-further-reading-corpora_
for suggestions on how to locate language resources.) 

Text Corpus Structure
---------------------

We have seen a variety of corpus structures so far; these are
summarized in fig-text-corpus-structure_.
The simplest kind lacks any structure: it is just a collection of texts.
Often, texts are grouped into categories that might correspond to genre, source, author, language, etc.
Sometimes these categories overlap, notably in the case of topical categories as a text can be
relevant to more than one topic.  Occasionally, text collections have temporal structure,
news collections being the most common example.


.. _fig-text-corpus-structure:
.. figure:: ../images/text-corpus-structure.png
   :scale: 120:140:140

   Common Structures for Text Corpora: The simplest kind of corpus is a collection
   of isolated texts with no particular organization; some corpora are structured
   into categories like genre (Brown Corpus); some categorizations overlap, such as
   topic categories (Reuters Corpus); other corpora represent language use over time
   (Inaugural Address Corpus).

   Basic Corpus Functionality defined in |NLTK|: more documentation can be found using
   ``help(nltk.corpus.reader)`` and by reading the online Corpus HOWTO at |NLTK-HOWTO-URL|.

|NLTK|\ 's corpus readers support efficient access to a variety of corpora, and can
be used to work with new corpora.  tab-corpus_ lists functionality
provided by the corpus readers.  We illustrate the difference between some
of the corpus access methods below: 

    >>> raw = gutenberg.raw("burgess-busterbrown.txt")
    >>> raw[1:20]
    'The Adventures of B'
    >>> words = gutenberg.words("burgess-busterbrown.txt")
    >>> words[1:20]
    ['The', 'Adventures', 'of', 'Buster', 'Bear', 'by', 'Thornton', 'W', '.',
    'Burgess', '1920', ']', 'I', 'BUSTER', 'BEAR', 'GOES', 'FISHING', 'Buster',
    'Bear']
    >>> sents = gutenberg.sents("burgess-busterbrown.txt")
    >>> sents[1:20]
    [['I'], ['BUSTER', 'BEAR', 'GOES', 'FISHING'], ['Buster', 'Bear', 'yawned', 'as',
    'he', 'lay', 'on', 'his', 'comfortable', 'bed', 'of', 'leaves', 'and', 'watched',
    'the', 'first', 'early', 'morning', 'sunbeams', 'creeping', 'through', ...], ...]

Loading your own Corpus
-----------------------

If you have a your own collection of text files that you would like to access using
the above methods, you can easily load them with the help of |NLTK|\ 's
``PlaintextCorpusReader``. Check the location of your files on your file system; in
the following example, we have taken this to be the directory
``/usr/share/dict``. Whatever the location, set this to be the value of
``corpus_root`` corpus-root-dict_.
The second parameter of the ``PlaintextCorpusReader`` initializer corpus-reader_
can be a list of fileids, like ``['a.txt', 'test/b.txt']``, 
or a pattern that matches all fileids, like ``'[abc]/.*\.txt'``
(see sec-regular-expressions-word-patterns_ for information
about regular expressions).

    >>> from nltk.corpus import PlaintextCorpusReader
    >>> corpus_root = '/usr/share/dict' # [_corpus-root-dict]
    >>> wordlists = PlaintextCorpusReader(corpus_root, '.*') # [_corpus-reader]
    >>> wordlists.fileids()
    ['README', 'connectives', 'propernames', 'web2', 'web2a', 'words']
    >>> wordlists.words('connectives')
    ['the', 'of', 'and', 'to', 'a', 'in', 'that', 'is', ...]

As another example, suppose you have your own local copy of Penn Treebank (release 3),
in ``C:\corpora``.  We can use the ``BracketParseCorpusReader`` to access this
corpus.  We specify the ``corpus_root`` to be the location of the parsed Wall Street
Journal component of the corpus corpus-root-treebank_, and give a ``file_pattern``
that matches the files contained within its subfolders file-pattern_ (using forward slashes).

.. doctest-ignore::
    >>> from nltk.corpus import BracketParseCorpusReader
    >>> corpus_root = r"C:\corpora\penntreebank\parsed\mrg\wsj" # [_corpus-root-treebank]
    >>> file_pattern = r".*/wsj_.*\.mrg" # [_file-pattern]
    >>> ptb = BracketParseCorpusReader(corpus_root, file_pattern)
    >>> ptb.fileids()
    ['00/wsj_0001.mrg', '00/wsj_0002.mrg', '00/wsj_0003.mrg', '00/wsj_0004.mrg', ...]
    >>> len(ptb.sents())
    49208
    >>> ptb.sents(fileids='20/wsj_2013.mrg')[19]
    ['The', '55-year-old', 'Mr.', 'Noriega', 'is', "n't", 'as', 'smooth', 'as', 'the',
    'shah', 'of', 'Iran', ',', 'as', 'well-born', 'as', 'Nicaragua', "'s", 'Anastasio',
    'Somoza', ',', 'as', 'imperial', 'as', 'Ferdinand', 'Marcos', 'of', 'the', 'Philippines',
    'or', 'as', 'bloody', 'as', 'Haiti', "'s", 'Baby', Doc', 'Duvalier', '.']

Conditional Frequency Distributions
-----------------------------------

We introduced frequency distributions in sec-computing-with-language-simple-statistics_.
We saw that given some list ``mylist`` of words or other items,
``FreqDist(mylist)`` would compute the number of occurrences of each
item in the list.  Here we will generalize this idea.

When the texts of a corpus are divided into several
categories, by genre, topic, author, etc, we can maintain separate
frequency distributions for each category.  This will allow us to
study systematic differences between the categories.  In the previous
section we achieved this using |NLTK|\ 's ``ConditionalFreqDist`` data
type.  A `conditional frequency distribution`:dt: is a collection of
frequency distributions, each one for a different "condition".  The
condition will often be the category of the text.  fig-tally2_
depicts a fragment of a conditional frequency distribution having just
two conditions, one for news text and one for romance text.

   Counting Words Appearing in a Text Collection (a conditional frequency distribution)

Conditions and Events
---------------------

A frequency distribution counts observable events,
such as the appearance of words in a text.  A conditional
frequency distribution needs to pair each event with a condition.
So instead of processing a sequence of words seq-words_,
we have to process a sequence of pairs seq-pairs_:

.. doctest-ignore::
    >>> text = ['The', 'Fulton', 'County', 'Grand', 'Jury', 'said', ...] # [_seq-words]
    >>> pairs = [('news', 'The'), ('news', 'Fulton'), ('news', 'County'), ...] # [_seq-pairs]

Each pair has the form ``(condition, event)``.  If we were processing the
entire Brown Corpus by genre there would be 15 conditions (one per genre),
and 1,161,192 events (one per word).

Counting Words by Genre
-----------------------

In sec-extracting-text-from-corpora_ we saw a conditional
frequency distribution where the condition was the section of the
Brown Corpus, and for each condition we counted words. Whereas
``FreqDist()`` takes a simple list as input, ``ConditionalFreqDist()``
takes a list of pairs.

    >>> from nltk.corpus import brown
    >>> cfd = nltk.ConditionalFreqDist(
    ...           (genre, word)
    ...           for genre in brown.categories()
    ...           for word in brown.words(categories=genre))

Let's break this down, and look at just two genres, news and romance.
For each genre each-genre_, we loop over every word in the genre each-word_,
producing pairs consisting of the genre and the word genre-word-pairs_:

    >>> genre_word = [(genre, word) # [_genre-word-pairs]
    ...               for genre in ['news', 'romance'] # [_each-genre]
    ...               for word in brown.words(categories=genre)] # [_each-word]
    >>> len(genre_word)
    170576

So, as we can see below,
pairs at the beginning of the list ``genre_word`` will be of the form
(``'news'``, *word*) start-genre_, while those at the end will be of the form
(``'romance'``, *word*) end-genre_.

    >>> genre_word[:4]
    [('news', 'The'), ('news', 'Fulton'), ('news', 'County'), ('news', 'Grand')] # [_start-genre]
    >>> genre_word[-4:]
    [('romance', 'afraid'), ('romance', 'not'), ('romance', "''"), ('romance', '.')] # [_end-genre]

We can now use this list of pairs to create a ``ConditionalFreqDist``, and
save it in a variable ``cfd``.  As usual, we can type the name of the
variable to inspect it inspect-cfd_, and verify it has two conditions conditions-cfd_:   

    >>> cfd = nltk.ConditionalFreqDist(genre_word)
    >>> cfd # [_inspect-cfd]
    <ConditionalFreqDist with 2 conditions>
    >>> cfd.conditions()
    ['news', 'romance'] # [_conditions-cfd]

Let's access the two conditions, and satisfy ourselves that each is just
a frequency distribution:

    >>> cfd['news']
    <FreqDist with 100554 outcomes>
    >>> cfd['romance']
    <FreqDist with 70022 outcomes>
    >>> list(cfd['romance'])
    [',', '.', 'the', 'and', 'to', 'a', 'of', '``', "''", 'was', 'I', 'in', 'he', 'had',
    '?', 'her', 'that', 'it', 'his', 'she', 'with', 'you', 'for', 'at', 'He', 'on', 'him',
    'said', '!', '--', 'be', 'as', ';', 'have', 'but', 'not', 'would', 'She', 'The', ...]
    >>> cfd['romance']['could']
    193

Plotting and Tabulating Distributions
-------------------------------------

Apart from combining two or more frequency distributions, and being easy to initialize,
a ``ConditionalFreqDist`` provides some useful methods for tabulation and plotting.

The plot in fig-inaugural2_ was based on a conditional frequency distribution
reproduced in the code below.
The condition is either of the words `america`:lx: or `citizen`:lx: america-citizen_,
and the counts being plotted are the number of times the word occured in a particular speech.
It expoits the fact that the filename for each speech, e.g., ``1865-Lincoln.txt``
contains the year as the first four characters first-four-chars_.
This code generates the pair ``('america', '1865')`` for
every instance of a word whose lowercased form starts with `america`:lx:
|mdash| such as `Americans`:lx: |mdash| in the file ``1865-Lincoln.txt``.

    >>> from nltk.corpus import inaugural
    >>> cfd = nltk.ConditionalFreqDist(
    ...           (target, fileid[:4]) # [_first-four-chars]
    ...           for fileid in inaugural.fileids()
    ...           for w in inaugural.words(fileid)
    ...           for target in ['america', 'citizen'] # [_america-citizen]
    ...           if w.lower().startswith(target))

The plot in fig-word-len-dist_ was also based on a conditional frequency distribution,
reproduced below.  This time, the condition is the name of the language
and the counts being plotted are derived from word lengths lang-len-word_.
It exploits the fact that the filename for each language is the language name followed
by ``'-Latin1'`` (the character encoding).

    >>> from nltk.corpus import udhr
    >>> languages = ['Chickasaw', 'English', 'German_Deutsch',
    ...     'Greenlandic_Inuktikut', 'Hungarian_Magyar', 'Ibibio_Efik']
    >>> cfd = nltk.ConditionalFreqDist(
    ...           (lang, len(word)) # [_lang-len-word]
    ...           for lang in languages
    ...           for word in udhr.words(lang + '-Latin1'))

In the ``plot()`` and ``tabulate()`` methods, we can
optionally specify which conditions to display with a ``conditions=`` parameter.
When we omit it, we get all the conditions.  Similarly, we can limit the
samples to display with a ``samples=`` parameter.  This makes it possible to
load a large quantity of data into a conditional frequency distribution, and then
to explore it by plotting or tabulating selected conditions and samples.  It also
gives us full control over the order of conditions and samples in any displays.
For example, we can tabulate the cumulative frequency data just for two
languages, and for words less than 10 characters long, as shown below.
We interpret a the last cell on the top row to mean that 1,638 words of the
English text have 9 or fewer letters.

    >>> cfd.tabulate(conditions=['English', 'German_Deutsch'],
    ...              samples=range(10), cumulative=True)
                      0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9
           English    0  185  525  883  997 1166 1283 1440 1558 1638
    German_Deutsch    0  171  263  614  717  894 1013 1110 1213 1275

.. note:: |TRY|
   Working with the news and romance genres from the Brown Corpus,
   find out which days of the week are most newsworthy, and which are most romantic.
   Define a variable called ``days`` containing a list of days of the week, i.e.
   ``['Monday', ...]``.  Now tabulate the counts for these words using
   ``cfd.tabulate(samples=days)``.  Now try the same thing using ``plot`` in place of ``tabulate``.
   You may control the output order of days with the help of an extra parameter:
   ``conditions=['Monday', ...]``.

You may have noticed that the multi-line expressions we have been
using with conditional frequency distributions look like list
comprehensions, but without the brackets.  In general,
when we use a list comprehension as a parameter to a function,
like ``set([w.lower for w in t])``, we are permitted to omit
the square brackets and just write: ``set(w.lower() for w in t)``.
(See the discussion of "generator expressions" in sec-sequences_
for more about this.)

Generating Random Text with Bigrams
-----------------------------------

We can use a conditional frequency distribution to create a table of
bigrams (word pairs). (We introducted bigrams in
sec-computing-with-language-simple-statistics_.)
The ``bigrams()`` function takes a list of
words and builds a list of consecutive word pairs:

    >>> sent = ['In', 'the', 'beginning', 'God', 'created', 'the', 'heaven',
    ...   'and', 'the', 'earth', '.']
    >>> nltk.bigrams(sent)
    [('In', 'the'), ('the', 'beginning'), ('beginning', 'God'), ('God', 'created'),
    ('created', 'the'), ('the', 'heaven'), ('heaven', 'and'), ('and', 'the'),
    ('the', 'earth'), ('earth', '.')]

In code-random-text_, we treat each word as a condition, and for each one
we effectively create a frequency distribution over the following
words.  The function ``generate_model()`` contains a simple loop to
generate text. When we call the function, we choose a word (such as
``'living'``) as our initial context, then once inside the loop, we
print the current value of the variable ``word``, and reset ``word``
to be the most likely token in that context (using ``max()``); next
time through the loop, we use that word as our new context.  As you
can see by inspecting the output, this simple approach to text
generation tends to get stuck in loops; another method would be to
randomly choose the next word from among the available words.

.. pylisting:: code-random-text
   :caption: Generating Random Text: this program obtains all bigrams
             from the text of the book of Genesis, then constructs a
             conditional frequency distribution to record which
             words are most likely to follow a given word; e.g., after
             the word `living`:lx:, the most likely word is
             `creature`:lx:; the ``generate_model()`` function uses this
             data, and a seed word, to generate random text. 

   def generate_model(cfdist, word, num=15):
       for i in range(num):
           print word,
           word = cfdist[word].max()

   text = nltk.corpus.genesis.words('english-kjv.txt')
   bigrams = nltk.bigrams(text)

Conditional frequency distributions are a useful data structure for many |NLP| tasks.
Their commonly-used methods are summarized in tab-conditionalfreqdist_.

-------------------------
More Python: Reusing Code
-------------------------

By this time you've probably typed and retyped a lot of code in the Python
interactive interpreter.  If you mess up when retyping a complex example you have
to enter it again.  Using the arrow keys to access and modify previous commands is helpful but only goes so
far.  In this section we see two important ways to reuse code: text editors and Python functions.

Creating Programs with a Text Editor
------------------------------------

The Python interactive interpreter performs your instructions as soon as you type
them.  Often, it is better to compose a multi-line program using a text editor,
then ask Python to run the whole program at once.  Using |IDLE|, you can do
this by going to the ``File`` menu and opening a new window.  Try this now, and
enter the following one-line program:

::

     print 'Monty Python'

Save this program in a file called ``monty.py``, then
go to the ``Run`` menu, and select the command ``Run Module``.
(We'll learn what modules are shortly.)
The result in the main |IDLE| window should look like this:

.. doctest-ignore::
    >>> ================================ RESTART ================================
    >>>
    Monty Python
    >>>

You can also type ``from monty import *`` and it will do the same thing.

From now on, you have a choice of using the interactive interpreter or a
text editor to create your programs.  It is often convenient to test your ideas
using the interpreter, revising a line of code until it does what you expect.
Once you're ready, you can paste the code
(minus any ``>>>`` or ``...`` prompts) into the text editor,
continue to expand it, and finally save the program
in a file so that you don't have to type it in again later.
Give the file a short but descriptive name, using all lowercase letters and separating
words with underscore, and using the ``.py`` filename extension, e.g., ``monty_python.py``.

.. note:: |IMPORTANT|
   Our inline code examples include the ``>>>`` and ``...`` prompts
   as if we are interacting directly with the interpreter.  As they get more complicated,
   you should instead type them into the editor, without the prompts, and run them
   from the editor as shown above.  When we provide longer programs in this book,
   we will leave out the prompts to remind you to type them into a file rather
   than using the interpreter.  You can see this already in code-random-text_ above.
   Note that it still includes a couple of lines with the Python prompt;
   this is the interactive part of the task where you inspect some data and invoke a function.
   Remember that all code samples like code-random-text_ are downloadable
   from |NLTK-URL|.

Functions
---------

Suppose that you work on analyzing text that involves different forms
of the same word, and that part of your program needs to work out
the plural form of a given singular noun.  Suppose it needs to do this
work in two places, once when it is processing some texts, and again
when it is processing user input.

Rather than repeating the same code several times over, it is more
efficient and reliable to localize this work inside a `function`:dt:.
A function is just a named block of code that performs some well-defined
task, as we saw in sec-computing-with-language-texts-and-words_.
A function is usually defined to take some inputs, using special variables known as `parameters`:dt:,
and it may produce a result, also known as a `return value`:dt:.
We define a function using the keyword ``def`` followed by the
function name and any input parameters, followed by the body of the
function.  Here's the function we saw in sec-computing-with-language-texts-and-words_
(including the ``import`` statement that makes division behave as expected):

    >>> from __future__ import division
    >>> def lexical_diversity(text):
    ...     return len(text) / len(set(text))

We use the keyword ``return`` to indicate the value that is
produced as output by the function.  In the above example,
all the work of the function is done in the ``return`` statement.
Here's an equivalent definition which does the same work
using multiple lines of code.  We'll change the parameter name
from ``text`` to ``my_text_data`` to remind you that this is an arbitrary choice:

    >>> def lexical_diversity(my_text_data):
    ...     word_count = len(my_text_data)
    ...     vocab_size = len(set(my_text_data))
    ...     diversity_score = word_count / vocab_size
    ...     return diversity_score

Notice that we've created some new variables inside the body of the function.
These are `local variables`:dt: and are not accessible outside the function.
So now we have defined a function with the name ``lexical_diversity``. But just
defining it won't produce any output!
Functions do nothing until they are "called" (or "invoked"):

.. doctest-ignore
    >>> lexical_diversity(text3)
    16.050197203298673

Let's return to our earlier scenario, and actually define a simple
function to work out English plurals.  The function ``plural()`` in code-plural_
takes a singular noun and generates a plural form, though it is not always
correct.  (We'll discuss functions at greater length in sec-functions_.)

.. pylisting:: code-plural
   :caption: A Python Function: this function tries to work out the
             plural form of any English noun; the keyword ``def`` (define)
             is followed by the function name, then a parameter inside
             parentheses, and a colon; the body of the function is the
             indented block of code; it tries to recognize patterns
             within the word and process the word accordingly; e.g., if the
             word ends with `y`:lx:, delete the `y`:lx: and add `ies`:lx:.

   def plural(word):
       if word.endswith('y'):
           return word[:-1] + 'ies'
       elif word[-1] in 'sx' or word[-2:] in ['sh', 'ch']:
           return word + 'es'
       elif word.endswith('an'):
           return word[:-2] + 'en'
       else:
           return word + 's'

   >>> plural('fairy')
   'fairies'
   >>> plural('woman')
   'women'

The ``endswith()`` function is always associated with a string object
(e.g., ``word`` in code-plural_).  To call such functions, we give
the name of the object, a period, and then the name of the function.
These functions are usually known as `methods`:dt:.   

Modules
-------

Over time you will find that you create a variety of useful little text processing functions,
and you end up copying them from old programs to new ones.  Which file contains the
latest version of the function you want to use?
It makes life a lot easier if you can collect your work into a single place, and
access previously defined functions without making copies.

To do this, save your function(s) in a file called (say) ``textproc.py``.
Now, you can access your work simply by importing it from the file:

.. doctest-ignore::
    >>> from textproc import plural
    >>> plural('wish')
    wishes
    >>> plural('fan')
    fen

Our plural function obviously has an error, since the plural of
`fan`:lx: is `fans`:lx:.
Instead of typing in a new version of the function, we can
simply edit the existing one.  Thus, at every
stage, there is only one version of our plural function, and no confusion about
which one is being used.

A collection of variable and function definitions in a file is called a Python
`module`:dt:.  A collection of related modules is called a `package`:dt:.
|NLTK|\ 's code for processing the Brown Corpus is an example of a module,
and its collection of code for processing all the different corpora is
an example of a package.  |NLTK| itself is a set of packages, sometimes
called a `library`:dt:.

.. caution:: If you are creating a file to contain some of your Python
   code, do *not* name your file ``nltk.py``: it may get imported in
   place of the "real" NLTK package.  When it imports modules, Python
   first looks in the current directory (folder).


.. _sec-lexical-resources:

-----------------
Lexical Resources
-----------------

A lexicon, or lexical resource, is a collection of words and/or phrases along
with associated information such as part of speech and sense definitions.
Lexical resources are secondary to texts, and are usually created and enriched with the help
of texts.  For example, if we have defined a text ``my_text``, then
``vocab = sorted(set(my_text))`` builds the vocabulary of ``my_text``,
while ``word_freq = FreqDist(my_text)`` counts the frequency of each word in the text.  Both
of ``vocab`` and ``word_freq`` are simple lexical resources.  Similarly, a concordance
like the one we saw in sec-computing-with-language-texts-and-words_
gives us information about word usage that might help in the preparation of
a dictionary.  Standard terminology for lexicons is illustrated in fig-lexicon_.
A `lexical entry`:dt: consists of a `headword`:dt: (also known as a `lemma`:dt:)
along with additional information such as the part of speech and the sense
definition.  Two distinct words having the same spelling are called `homonyms`:dt:.

.. _fig-lexicon:
.. figure:: ../images/lexicon.png
   :scale: 180
   
   Lexicon Terminology: lexical entries for two lemmas
   having the same spelling (homonyms), providing part of speech
   and gloss information.

The simplest kind of lexicon is nothing more than a sorted list of words.
Sophisticated lexicons include complex structure within and across
the individual entries.  In this section we'll look at some lexical resources
included with |NLTK|.

Wordlist Corpora
----------------

.. XXX There's a useful opportunity here to link back to the discussion of what words
   characterize a text found in ch01.

|NLTK| includes some corpora that are nothing more than wordlists.
The Words Corpus is the ``/usr/share/dict/words`` file from Unix, used by
some spell checkers.  We can use it to find unusual or mis-spelt
words in a text corpus, as shown in code-unusual_.

.. pylisting:: code-unusual
   :caption: Filtering a Text: this program computes the vocabulary of a text,
             then removes all items that occur in an existing wordlist,
             leaving just the uncommon or mis-spelt words.

    def unusual_words(text):
        text_vocab = set(w.lower() for w in text if w.isalpha())
        english_vocab = set(w.lower() for w in nltk.corpus.words.words())
        unusual = text_vocab.difference(english_vocab)
        return sorted(unusual)
    
    >>> unusual_words(nltk.corpus.gutenberg.words('austen-sense.txt'))
    ['abbeyland', 'abhorrence', 'abominably', 'abridgement', 'accordant', 'accustomary',
    'adieus', 'affability', 'affectedly', 'aggrandizement', 'alighted', 'allenham',
    'amiably', 'annamaria', 'annuities', 'apologising', 'arbour', 'archness', ...]
    >>> unusual_words(nltk.corpus.nps_chat.words())
    ['aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa', 'aaahhhh', 'abou', 'abourted', 'abs', 'ack', 'acros',
    'actualy', 'adduser', 'addy', 'adoted', 'adreniline', 'ae', 'afe', 'affari', 'afk',
    'agaibn', 'agurlwithbigguns', 'ahah', 'ahahah', 'ahahh', 'ahahha', 'ahem', 'ahh', ...]

There is also a corpus of `stopwords`:dt:, that is, high-frequency
words like `the`:lx:, `to`:lx: and `also`:lx: that we sometimes
want to filter out of a document before further processing. Stopwords
usually have little lexical content, and their presence in a text fails
to distinguish it from other texts.

    >>> from nltk.corpus import stopwords
    >>> stopwords.words('english')
    ['a', "a's", 'able', 'about', 'above', 'according', 'accordingly', 'across',
    'actually', 'after', 'afterwards', 'again', 'against', "ain't", 'all', 'allow',
    'allows', 'almost', 'alone', 'along', 'already', 'also', 'although', 'always', ...]

Let's define a function to compute what fraction of words in a text are *not* in the
stopwords list:

    >>> def content_fraction(text):
    ...     stopwords = nltk.corpus.stopwords.words('english')
    ...     content = [w for w in text if w.lower() not in stopwords]
    ...     return len(content) / len(text)
    ...    
    >>> content_fraction(nltk.corpus.reuters.words())
    0.65997695393285261

Thus, with the help of stopwords we filter out a third of the words of the text.
Notice that we've combined two different kinds of corpus here, using a lexical
resource to filter the content of a text corpus.

.. _fig-target:
.. figure:: ../images/target.png
   :scale: 30:150:35

   A Word Puzzle: a grid of randomly chosen letters with rules for
   creating words out of the letters; this puzzle is known as "Target."

A wordlist is useful for solving word puzzles, such as the one in fig-target_.
Our program iterates through every word and, for each one, checks whether it meets
the conditions.  It is easy to check obligatory letter obligatory-letter_
and length constraints length-constraint_ (and we'll
only look for words with six or more letters here).
It is trickier to check that candidate solutions only use combinations of the
supplied letters, especially since some of the supplied letters
appear twice (here, the letter `v`:lx:).
The ``FreqDist`` comparison method freqdist-compare_ permits us to check that
the frequency of each *letter* in the candidate word is less than or equal
to the frequency of the corresponding letter in the puzzle.

    >>> puzzle_letters = nltk.FreqDist('egivrvonl')
    >>> obligatory = 'r'
    >>> wordlist = nltk.corpus.words.words()
    >>> [w for w in wordlist if len(w) >= 6 # [_length-constraint]
    ...                      and obligatory in w # [_obligatory-letter]
    ...                      and nltk.FreqDist(w) <= puzzle_letters] # [_freqdist-compare]
    ['glover', 'gorlin', 'govern', 'grovel', 'ignore', 'involver', 'lienor',
    'linger', 'longer', 'lovering', 'noiler', 'overling', 'region', 'renvoi',
    'revolving', 'ringle', 'roving', 'violer', 'virole']

One more wordlist corpus is the Names corpus, containing 8,000 first names categorized by gender.
The male and female names are stored in separate files.  Let's find names which appear
in both files, i.e. names that are ambiguous for gender:

    >>> names = nltk.corpus.names
    >>> names.fileids()
    ['female.txt', 'male.txt']
    >>> male_names = names.words('male.txt')
    >>> female_names = names.words('female.txt')
    >>> [w for w in male_names if w in female_names]
    ['Abbey', 'Abbie', 'Abby', 'Addie', 'Adrian', 'Adrien', 'Ajay', 'Alex', 'Alexis',
    'Alfie', 'Ali', 'Alix', 'Allie', 'Allyn', 'Andie', 'Andrea', 'Andy', 'Angel',
    'Angie', 'Ariel', 'Ashley', 'Aubrey', 'Augustine', 'Austin', 'Averil', ...]

It is well known that names ending in the letter `a`:lx: are almost always female.
We can see this and some other patterns in the graph in fig-cfd-gender_,
produced by the following code.  Remember that ``name[-1]`` is the last letter
of ``name``. 

.. doctest-ignore::
    >>> cfd = nltk.ConditionalFreqDist(
    ...           (fileid, name[-1])
    ...           for fileid in names.fileids()
    ...           for name in names.words(fileid))
    >>> cfd.plot()

.. _fig-cfd-gender:
.. figure:: ../images/cfd-gender.png
   :scale: 25

   Conditional Frequency Distribution: this plot shows the number of female and male names
   ending with each letter of the alphabet; most names ending with `a`:lx:, `e`:lx: or `i`:lx:
   are female; names ending in `h`:lx: and `l`:lx: are equally likely to be male or female;
   names ending in `k`:lx:, `o`:lx:, `r`:lx:, `s`:lx:, and `t`:lx: are likely to be male.

A Pronouncing Dictionary
------------------------

A slightly richer kind of lexical resource is a table (or spreadsheet), containing a word
plus some properties in each row.  |NLTK| includes the CMU Pronouncing
Dictionary for US English, which was designed for
use by speech synthesizers.

    >>> entries = nltk.corpus.cmudict.entries()
    >>> len(entries)
    127012
    >>> for entry in entries[39943:39951]:
    ...     print entry
    ... 
    ('fir', ['F', 'ER1'])
    ('fire', ['F', 'AY1', 'ER0'])
    ('fire', ['F', 'AY1', 'R'])
    ('firearm', ['F', 'AY1', 'ER0', 'AA2', 'R', 'M'])
    ('firearm', ['F', 'AY1', 'R', 'AA2', 'R', 'M'])
    ('firearms', ['F', 'AY1', 'ER0', 'AA2', 'R', 'M', 'Z'])
    ('firearms', ['F', 'AY1', 'R', 'AA2', 'R', 'M', 'Z'])
    ('fireball', ['F', 'AY1', 'ER0', 'B', 'AO2', 'L'])

For each word, this lexicon provides a list of phonetic
codes |mdash| distinct labels for each contrastive sound |mdash|
known as `phones`:lx:.  Observe that `fire`:lx: has two pronunciations
(in US English):
the one-syllable ``F AY1 R``, and the two-syllable ``F AY1 ER0``.
The symbols in the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary are from the *Arpabet*,
described in more detail at ``http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arpabet``

.. XXX Hmm -- would it be better to first explain tuple assignment outside the
   context of a for loop?  (not sure how to fix this; can't use the word "tuple" yet)

Each entry consists of two parts, and we can
process these individually using a more complex version of the ``for`` statement.
Instead of writing ``for entry in entries:``, we replace
``entry`` with *two* variable names, ``word, pron`` word-pron_.
Now, each time through the loop, ``word`` is assigned the first part of the
entry, and ``pron`` is assigned the second part of the entry:

    >>> for word, pron in entries: # [_word-pron]
    ...     if len(pron) == 3: # [_len-pron-three]
    ...         ph1, ph2, ph3 = pron # [_tuple-assignment]
    ...         if ph1 == 'P' and ph3 == 'T':
    ...             print word, ph2,
    ...
    pait EY1 pat AE1 pate EY1 patt AE1 peart ER1 peat IY1 peet IY1 peete IY1 pert ER1
    pet EH1 pete IY1 pett EH1 piet IY1 piette IY1 pit IH1 pitt IH1 pot AA1 pote OW1
    pott AA1 pout AW1 puett UW1 purt ER1 put UH1 putt AH1

The above program scans the lexicon looking for entries whose pronunciation consists of
three phones len-pron-three_.  If the condition is true, it assigns the contents
of ``pron`` to three new variables ``ph1``, ``ph2`` and ``ph3``.  Notice the unusual
form of the statement which does that work tuple-assignment_.

Here's another example of the same ``for`` statement, this time used inside a list
comprehension.  This program finds all words whose pronunciation ends with a syllable
sounding like `nicks`:lx:.  You could use this method to find rhyming words.

    >>> syllable = ['N', 'IH0', 'K', 'S']
    >>> [word for word, pron in entries if pron[-4:] == syllable]
    ["atlantic's", 'audiotronics', 'avionics', 'beatniks', 'calisthenics', 'centronics',
    'chetniks', "clinic's", 'clinics', 'conics', 'cynics', 'diasonics', "dominic's",
    'ebonics', 'electronics', "electronics'", 'endotronics', "endotronics'", 'enix', ...]

Notice that the one pronunciation is spelt in several ways: `nics`:lx:, `niks`:lx:, `nix`:lx:,
even `ntic's`:lx: with a silent `t`:lx:, for the word `atlantic's`:lx:.  Let's look for some other
mismatches between pronunciation and writing.  Can you summarize the purpose of
the following examples and explain how they work?

    >>> [w for w, pron in entries if pron[-1] == 'M' and w[-1] == 'n']
    ['autumn', 'column', 'condemn', 'damn', 'goddamn', 'hymn', 'solemn']
    >>> sorted(set(w[:2] for w, pron in entries if pron[0] == 'N' and w[0] != 'n'))
    ['gn', 'kn', 'mn', 'pn']

The phones contain digits to represent 
primary stress (``1``), secondary stress (``2``) and no stress (``0``).
As our final example, we define a function to extract the stress digits
and then scan our lexicon to find words having a particular stress pattern.

    >>> def stress(pron):
    ...     return [char for phone in pron for char in phone if char.isdigit()] 
    >>> [w for w, pron in entries if stress(pron) == ['0', '1', '0', '2', '0']]
    ['abbreviated', 'abbreviating', 'accelerated', 'accelerating', 'accelerator',
    'accentuated', 'accentuating', 'accommodated', 'accommodating', 'accommodative',
    'accumulated', 'accumulating', 'accumulative', 'accumulator', 'accumulators', ...]
    >>> [w for w, pron in entries if stress(pron) == ['0', '2', '0', '1', '0']]
    ['abbreviation', 'abbreviations', 'abomination', 'abortifacient', 'abortifacients',
    'academicians', 'accommodation', 'accommodations', 'accreditation', 'accreditations',
    'accumulation', 'accumulations', 'acetylcholine', 'acetylcholine', 'adjudication', ...]

.. note::
   A subtlety of the above program is that our
   user-defined function ``stress()`` is invoked inside the condition of
   a list comprehension.  There is also a doubly-nested ``for`` loop.
   There's a lot going on here and you might want
   to return to this once you've had more experience using list comprehensions.

We can use a conditional frequency distribution to help us find minimally-contrasting
sets of words.  Here we find all the `p`:lx:\ -words consisting of three sounds p3-words_,
and group them according to their first and last sounds group-first-last_.

    >>> p3 = [(pron[0]+'-'+pron[2], word) # [_group-first-last]
    ...       for (word, pron) in entries
    ...       if pron[0] == 'P' and len(pron) == 3] # [_p3-words]
    >>> cfd = nltk.ConditionalFreqDist(p3)
    >>> for template in cfd.conditions():
    ...     if len(cfd[template]) > 10:
    ...         words = cfd[template].keys()
    ...         wordlist = ' '.join(words)
    ...         print template, wordlist[:70] + "..."
    ...

Rather than iterating over the whole dictionary, we can also access it
by looking up particular words.  We will use Python's dictionary data
structure, which we will study systematically in sec-dictionaries_.
We look up a dictionary by specifying its name, followed by a `key`:dt:
(such as the word ``'fire'``) inside square brackets dict-key_.

    >>> prondict = nltk.corpus.cmudict.dict()
    >>> prondict['fire'] # [_dict-key]
    [['F', 'AY1', 'ER0'], ['F', 'AY1', 'R']]
    >>> prondict['blog'] # [_dict-key-error]
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    KeyError: 'blog'
    >>> prondict['blog'] = [['B', 'L', 'AA1', 'G']] # [_dict-assign]
    >>> prondict['blog']
    [['B', 'L', 'AA1', 'G']]

If we try to look up a non-existent key dict-key-error_, we get a ``KeyError``.
This is similar to what happens when we index a list with an
integer that is to large, producing an ``IndexError``.
The word `blog`:lx: is missing from the pronouncing dictionary,
so we tweak our version by assigning a value for this key dict-assign_
(this has no effect on the |NLTK| corpus; next time we access it,
`blog`:lx: will still be absent).

We can use any lexical resource to process a text, e.g., to filter out words having
some lexical property (like nouns), or mapping every word of the text.
For example, the following text-to-speech function looks up each word
of the text in the pronunciation dictionary.

    >>> text = ['natural', 'language', 'processing']
    >>> [ph for w in text for ph in prondict[w][0]]
    ['N', 'AE1', 'CH', 'ER0', 'AH0', 'L', 'L', 'AE1', 'NG', 'G', 'W', 'AH0', 'JH',
    'P', 'R', 'AA1', 'S', 'EH0', 'S', 'IH0', 'NG']

Comparative Wordlists
---------------------

Another example of a tabular lexicon is the `comparative wordlist`:dt:.
|NLTK| includes so-called `Swadesh wordlists`:dt:, lists of about 200 common words
in several languages.  The languages are identified using an ISO 639 two-letter code.

    >>> from nltk.corpus import swadesh
    >>> swadesh.fileids()
    ['be', 'bg', 'bs', 'ca', 'cs', 'cu', 'de', 'en', 'es', 'fr', 'hr', 'it', 'la', 'mk',
    'nl', 'pl', 'pt', 'ro', 'ru', 'sk', 'sl', 'sr', 'sw', 'uk']
    >>> swadesh.words('en')
    ['I', 'you (singular), thou', 'he', 'we', 'you (plural)', 'they', 'this', 'that',
    'here', 'there', 'who', 'what', 'where', 'when', 'how', 'not', 'all', 'many', 'some',
    'few', 'other', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'big', 'long', 'wide', ...] 

We can access cognate words from multiple languages using the ``entries()`` method,
specifying a list of languages.  With one further step we can convert this into
a simple dictionary (we'll learn about ``dict()`` in sec-dictionaries_).

    >>> fr2en = swadesh.entries(['fr', 'en'])
    >>> fr2en
    [('je', 'I'), ('tu, vous', 'you (singular), thou'), ('il', 'he'), ...]
    >>> translate = dict(fr2en)
    >>> translate['chien']
    'dog'
    >>> translate['jeter']
    'throw'

We can make our simple translator more useful by adding other source languages.
Let's get the German-English and Spanish-English pairs, convert each to a
dictionary using ``dict()``, then *update* our original ``translate`` dictionary
with these additional mappings:

    >>> de2en = swadesh.entries(['de', 'en'])    # German-English
    >>> es2en = swadesh.entries(['es', 'en'])    # Spanish-English
    >>> translate.update(dict(de2en))
    >>> translate.update(dict(es2en))
    >>> translate['Hund']
    'dog'
    >>> translate['perro']
    'dog'
    
We can compare words in various Germanic and Romance languages:

    >>> languages = ['en', 'de', 'nl', 'es', 'fr', 'pt', 'la']
    >>> for i in [139, 140, 141, 142]:
    ...     print swadesh.entries(languages)[i]
    ... 
    ('say', 'sagen', 'zeggen', 'decir', 'dire', 'dizer', 'dicere')
    ('sing', 'singen', 'zingen', 'cantar', 'chanter', 'cantar', 'canere')
    ('play', 'spielen', 'spelen', 'jugar', 'jouer', 'jogar, brincar', 'ludere')
    ('float', 'schweben', 'zweven', 'flotar', 'flotter', 'flutuar, boiar', 'fluctuare')

Shoebox and Toolbox Lexicons
----------------------------

Perhaps the single most popular tool used by linguists for managing data
is *Toolbox*, previously known as *Shoebox* since it replaces
the field linguist's traditional shoebox full of file cards.
Toolbox is freely downloadable from ``http://www.sil.org/computing/toolbox/``.

A Toolbox file consists of a collection of entries,
where each entry is made up of one or more fields.
Most fields are optional or repeatable, which means that this kind of
lexical resource cannot be treated as a table or spreadsheet.

Here is a dictionary for the Rotokas language.  We see just the first entry,
for the word `kaa`:lx: meaning "to gag":

    >>> from nltk.corpus import toolbox
    >>> toolbox.entries('rotokas.dic')
    [('kaa', [('ps', 'V'), ('pt', 'A'), ('ge', 'gag'), ('tkp', 'nek i pas'),
    ('dcsv', 'true'), ('vx', '1'), ('sc', '???'), ('dt', '29/Oct/2005'),
    ('ex', 'Apoka ira kaaroi aioa-ia reoreopaoro.'),
    ('xp', 'Kaikai i pas long nek bilong Apoka bikos em i kaikai na toktok.'),
    ('xe', 'Apoka is gagging from food while talking.')]), ...]

Entries consist of a series of attribute-value pairs, like ``('ps', 'V')``
to indicate that the part-of-speech is ``'V'`` (verb), and ``('ge', 'gag')``
to indicate that the gloss-into-English is ``'gag'``.
The last three pairs contain
an example sentence in Rotokas and its translations into Tok Pisin and English.

The loose structure of Toolbox files makes it hard for us to do much more with them
at this stage.  XML provides a powerful way to process this kind of corpus and
we will return to this topic in chap-data_.


.. note::
   The Rotokas language is spoken on the island of Bougainville, Papua New Guinea.
   This lexicon was contributed to |NLTK| by Stuart Robinson.   
   Rotokas is notable for having an inventory of just 12 phonemes (contrastive sounds),
   ``http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotokas_language``

WordNet
-------

.. XXX Can we do a better job of explaining what's going on in WordNet? Trying to
   process the combination of WN's unfamiliar organization and datastructures, plus
   the notation, plus the NLTK interface, imposes a very heavy cognitive load.
   E.g. this whole WN  notion is pretty bizarre in some ways: "entity ``car.n.01`` is called a `synset`:dt:,"

`WordNet`:idx: is a semantically-oriented dictionary of English,
similar to a traditional thesaurus but with a richer structure.
|NLTK| includes the English WordNet, with 155,287 words
and 117,659 synonym sets.  We'll begin by
looking at synonyms and how they are accessed in WordNet.

Senses and Synonyms
-------------------

.. senses in order of decreasing frequency?
.. how to access frequency?

Consider the sentence in ex-car1_.
If we replace the word `motorcar`:lx: in ex-car1_ by `automobile`:lx:,
to get ex-car2_, the meaning of the sentence stays pretty much the same:

.. ex::
   .. _ex-car1:
   .. ex::
      Benz is credited with the invention of the motorcar.

   .. _ex-car2:
   .. ex::
      Benz is credited with the invention of the automobile.

Since everything else in the sentence has remained unchanged, we can
conclude that the words `motorcar`:lx: and `automobile`:lx: have the
same meaning, i.e. they are `synonyms`:dt:.  We can explore these
words with the help of WordNet: 

    >>> from nltk.corpus import wordnet as wn
    >>> wn.synsets('motorcar')
    [Synset('car.n.01')]

Thus, `motorcar`:lx: has just one possible meaning and it is identified as ``car.n.01``,
the first noun sense of `car`:lx:.  The entity ``car.n.01`` is called a `synset`:dt:,
or "synonym set", a collection of synonymous words (or "lemmas"):

    >>> wn.synset('car.n.01').lemma_names
    ['car', 'auto', 'automobile', 'machine', 'motorcar']

Each word of a synset can have several meanings, e.g., `car`:lx: can also signify
a train carriage, a gondola, or an elevator car.  However, we are only interested
in the single meaning that is common to all words of the above synset.  Synsets
also come with a prose definition and some example sentences:

    >>> wn.synset('car.n.01').definition
    'a motor vehicle with four wheels; usually propelled by an internal combustion engine'
    >>> wn.synset('car.n.01').examples
    ['he needs a car to get to work']

Although definitions help humans to understand the intended meaning of a synset,
the `words`:em: of the synset are often more useful for our programs.
To eliminate ambiguity, we will identify these words as
``car.n.01.automobile``, ``car.n.01.motorcar``, and so on.
This pairing of a synset with a word is called a lemma.
We can get all the lemmas for a given synset get-lemmas_,
look up a particular lemma lookup-lemma_,
get the synset corresponding to a lemma get-synset_,
and get the "name" of a lemma get-name_:

    >>> wn.synset('car.n.01').lemmas # [_get-lemmas]
    [Lemma('car.n.01.car'), Lemma('car.n.01.auto'), Lemma('car.n.01.automobile'),
    Lemma('car.n.01.machine'), Lemma('car.n.01.motorcar')]
    >>> wn.lemma('car.n.01.automobile') # [_lookup-lemma]
    Lemma('car.n.01.automobile')
    >>> wn.lemma('car.n.01.automobile').synset # [_get-synset]
    Synset('car.n.01')
    >>> wn.lemma('car.n.01.automobile').name # [_get-name]
    'automobile'

Unlike the words `automobile`:lx: and `motorcar`:lx:, which are unambiguous
and have one synset, the word `car`:lx: is ambiguous, having five synsets:

    >>> wn.synsets('car')
    [Synset('car.n.01'), Synset('car.n.02'), Synset('car.n.03'), Synset('car.n.04'),
    Synset('cable_car.n.01')]
    >>> for synset in wn.synsets('car'):
    ...     print synset.lemma_names
    ... 
    ['car', 'auto', 'automobile', 'machine', 'motorcar']
    ['car', 'railcar', 'railway_car', 'railroad_car']
    ['car', 'gondola']
    ['car', 'elevator_car']
    ['cable_car', 'car']

For convenience, we can access all the lemmas involving the word `car`:lx:
as follows.

    >>> wn.lemmas('car')
    [Lemma('car.n.01.car'), Lemma('car.n.02.car'), Lemma('car.n.03.car'),
    Lemma('car.n.04.car'), Lemma('cable_car.n.01.car')]

.. note:: |TRY|
   Write down all the senses of the word `dish`:lx: that you can think of.  Now, explore this
   word with the help of WordNet, using the same operations we used above.

The WordNet Hierarchy
---------------------

WordNet synsets correspond to abstract concepts, and they don't always
have corresponding words in English.  These concepts are linked together in a hierarchy.
Some concepts are very general, such as *Entity*, *State*, *Event* |mdash| these are called
`unique beginners`:dt: or root synsets.  Others, such as *gas guzzler* and
*hatchback*, are much more specific. A small portion of a concept
hierarchy is illustrated in fig-wn-hierarchy_.

.. _fig-wn-hierarchy:
.. figure:: ../images/wordnet-hierarchy.png
   :scale: 25:120:25

   Fragment of WordNet Concept Hierarchy: nodes correspond to synsets;
   edges indicate the hypernym/hyponym relation, i.e. the relation between
   superordinate and subordinate concepts.

WordNet makes it easy to navigate between concepts.
For example, given a concept like *motorcar*,
we can look at the concepts that are more specific;
the (immediate) `hyponyms`:dt:.

    >>> motorcar = wn.synset('car.n.01')
    >>> types_of_motorcar = motorcar.hyponyms()
    >>> types_of_motorcar[26]
    Synset('ambulance.n.01')
    >>> sorted([lemma.name for synset in types_of_motorcar for lemma in synset.lemmas])
    ['Model_T', 'S.U.V.', 'SUV', 'Stanley_Steamer', 'ambulance', 'beach_waggon',
    'beach_wagon', 'bus', 'cab', 'compact', 'compact_car', 'convertible',
    'coupe', 'cruiser', 'electric', 'electric_automobile', 'electric_car',
    'estate_car', 'gas_guzzler', 'hack', 'hardtop', 'hatchback', 'heap',
    'horseless_carriage', 'hot-rod', 'hot_rod', 'jalopy', 'jeep', 'landrover',
    'limo', 'limousine', 'loaner', 'minicar', 'minivan', 'pace_car', 'patrol_car',
    'phaeton', 'police_car', 'police_cruiser', 'prowl_car', 'race_car', 'racer',
    'racing_car', 'roadster', 'runabout', 'saloon', 'secondhand_car', 'sedan',
    'sport_car', 'sport_utility', 'sport_utility_vehicle', 'sports_car', 'squad_car',
    'station_waggon', 'station_wagon', 'stock_car', 'subcompact', 'subcompact_car',
    'taxi', 'taxicab', 'tourer', 'touring_car', 'two-seater', 'used-car', 'waggon',
    'wagon']

We can also navigate up the hierarchy by visiting hypernyms.  Some words
have multiple paths, because they can be classified in more than one way.
There are two paths between ``car.n.01`` and ``entity.n.01`` because
``wheeled_vehicle.n.01`` can be classified as both a vehicle and a container.
 
    >>> motorcar.hypernyms()
    [Synset('motor_vehicle.n.01')]
    >>> paths = motorcar.hypernym_paths()
    >>> len(paths)
    2
    >>> [synset.name for synset in paths[0]]
    ['entity.n.01', 'physical_entity.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'whole.n.02', 'artifact.n.01',
    'instrumentality.n.03', 'container.n.01', 'wheeled_vehicle.n.01',
    'self-propelled_vehicle.n.01', 'motor_vehicle.n.01', 'car.n.01']
    >>> [synset.name for synset in paths[1]]
    ['entity.n.01', 'physical_entity.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'whole.n.02', 'artifact.n.01',
    'instrumentality.n.03', 'conveyance.n.03', 'vehicle.n.01', 'wheeled_vehicle.n.01',
    'self-propelled_vehicle.n.01', 'motor_vehicle.n.01', 'car.n.01']

We can get the most general hypernyms (or root hypernyms) of
a synset as follows:

    >>> motorcar.root_hypernyms()
    [Synset('entity.n.01')]

.. note:: |TRY|
   Try out |NLTK|\ 's convenient graphical WordNet browser: ``nltk.app.wordnet()``.
   Explore the WordNet hierarchy by following the hypernym and hyponym links. 

More Lexical Relations
----------------------

Hypernyms and hyponyms are called `lexical relations`:dt: because they relate one
synset to another.  These two relations navigate up and down the "is-a" hierarchy.
Another important way to navigate the WordNet network is from items to their
components (`meronyms`:dt:) or to the things they are contained in (`holonyms`:dt:).
For example, the parts of a `tree`:lx: are its `trunk`:lx:, `crown`:lx:, and so on;
the ``part_meronyms()``.
The *substance* a tree is made of includes `heartwood`:lx: and `sapwood`:lx:;
the ``substance_meronyms()``.
A collection of trees forms a `forest`:lx:; the ``member_holonyms()``:

    >>> wn.synset('tree.n.01').part_meronyms()
    [Synset('burl.n.02'), Synset('crown.n.07'), Synset('stump.n.01'),
    Synset('trunk.n.01'), Synset('limb.n.02')]
    >>> wn.synset('tree.n.01').substance_meronyms()
    [Synset('heartwood.n.01'), Synset('sapwood.n.01')]
    >>> wn.synset('tree.n.01').member_holonyms()
    [Synset('forest.n.01')]

To see just how intricate things can get, consider the word `mint`:lx:, which
has several closely-related senses.  We can see that ``mint.n.04`` is part of
``mint.n.02`` and the substance from which ``mint.n.05`` is made.

    >>> for synset in wn.synsets('mint', wn.NOUN):
    ...     print synset.name + ':', synset.definition
    ... 
    batch.n.02: (often followed by `of') a large number or amount or extent
    mint.n.02: any north temperate plant of the genus Mentha with aromatic leaves and
               small mauve flowers
    mint.n.03: any member of the mint family of plants
    mint.n.04: the leaves of a mint plant used fresh or candied
    mint.n.05: a candy that is flavored with a mint oil
    mint.n.06: a plant where money is coined by authority of the government
    >>> wn.synset('mint.n.04').part_holonyms()
    [Synset('mint.n.02')]
    >>> wn.synset('mint.n.04').substance_holonyms()
    [Synset('mint.n.05')]

There are also relationships between verbs.  For example, the act of `walking`:lx: involves the act of `stepping`:lx:,
so walking `entails`:dt: stepping.  Some verbs have multiple entailments:

    >>> wn.synset('walk.v.01').entailments()
    [Synset('step.v.01')]
    >>> wn.synset('eat.v.01').entailments()
    [Synset('swallow.v.01'), Synset('chew.v.01')]
    >>> wn.synset('tease.v.03').entailments()
    [Synset('arouse.v.07'), Synset('disappoint.v.01')]

Some lexical relationships hold between lemmas, e.g., `antonymy`:dt:\ :

    >>> wn.lemma('supply.n.02.supply').antonyms()
    [Lemma('demand.n.02.demand')]
    >>> wn.lemma('rush.v.01.rush').antonyms()
    [Lemma('linger.v.04.linger')]
    >>> wn.lemma('horizontal.a.01.horizontal').antonyms()
    [Lemma('vertical.a.01.vertical'), Lemma('inclined.a.02.inclined')]
    >>> wn.lemma('staccato.r.01.staccato').antonyms()
    [Lemma('legato.r.01.legato')]

You can see the lexical relations, and the other methods defined
on a synset, using ``dir()``, for example: ``dir(wn.synset('harmony.n.02'))``.

Semantic Similarity
-------------------

.. TODO: discuss WSD, mention Semcor, give pine cone example

We have seen that synsets are linked by a complex network of
lexical relations.  Given a particular synset, we can traverse
the WordNet network to find synsets with related meanings.
Knowing which words are semantically related
is useful for indexing a collection of texts, so
that a search for a general term like `vehicle`:lx: will match documents
containing specific terms like `limousine`:lx:.

Recall that each synset has one or more hypernym paths that link it
to a root hypernym such as ``entity.n.01``.
Two synsets linked to the same root may have several hypernyms in common
(cf fig-wn-hierarchy_).
If two synsets share a very specific hypernym |mdash| one that is low
down in the hypernym hierarchy |mdash| they must be closely related.

    >>> right = wn.synset('right_whale.n.01')
    >>> orca = wn.synset('orca.n.01')
    >>> minke = wn.synset('minke_whale.n.01')
    >>> tortoise = wn.synset('tortoise.n.01')
    >>> novel = wn.synset('novel.n.01')
    >>> right.lowest_common_hypernyms(minke)
    [Synset('baleen_whale.n.01')]
    >>> right.lowest_common_hypernyms(orca)
    [Synset('whale.n.02')]
    >>> right.lowest_common_hypernyms(tortoise)
    [Synset('vertebrate.n.01')]
    >>> right.lowest_common_hypernyms(novel)
    [Synset('entity.n.01')]

Of course we know that `whale`:lx: is very specific (and `baleen whale`:lx: even more so),
while `vertebrate`:lx: is more general and `entity`:lx: is completely general.
We can quantify this concept of generality by looking up the depth of each synset:

    >>> wn.synset('baleen_whale.n.01').min_depth()
    14
    >>> wn.synset('whale.n.02').min_depth()
    13
    >>> wn.synset('vertebrate.n.01').min_depth()
    8
    >>> wn.synset('entity.n.01').min_depth()
    0

Similarity measures have been defined over the collection of WordNet synsets
which incorporate the above insight.  For example,
``path_similarity`` assigns a score in the range ``0``\ |ndash|\
``1`` based on the shortest path that connects the concepts in the hypernym
hierarchy (``-1`` is returned in those cases where a path cannot be
found).  Comparing a synset with itself will return ``1``.
Consider the following similarity scores, relating `right whale`:lx:
to `minke whale`:lx:, `orca`:lx:, `tortoise`:lx:, and `novel`:lx:.
Although the numbers won't mean much, they decrease as
we move away from the semantic space of sea creatures to inanimate objects.

    >>> right.path_similarity(minke)
    0.25
    >>> right.path_similarity(orca)
    0.16666666666666666
    >>> right.path_similarity(tortoise)
    0.076923076923076927
    >>> right.path_similarity(novel)
    0.043478260869565216

.. note::
   Several other similarity measures are available; you can type ``help(wn)``
   for more information.  |NLTK| also includes VerbNet, a hierarhical verb lexicon linked to WordNet.
   It can be accessed with ``nltk.corpus.verbnet``.

Summary
-------

* A text corpus is a large, structured collection of texts.  NLTK comes with many corpora,
  e.g., the Brown Corpus, ``nltk.corpus.brown``.
* Some text corpora are categorized, e.g., by genre or topic; sometimes the
  categories of a corpus overlap each other.
* A conditional frequency distribution is a collection of frequency distributions,
  each one for a different condition.  They can be used for counting word frequencies,
  given a context or a genre.
* Python programs more than a few lines long should be entered using a text editor,
  saved to a file with a ``.py`` extension, and accessed using an ``import`` statement.
* Python functions permit you to associate a name with a particular block of code,
  and re-use that code as often as necessary.
* Some functions, known as "methods", are associated with an object and we give the object
  name followed by a period followed by the function, like this: ``x.funct(y)``,
  e.g., ``word.isalpha()``.
* To find out about some variable ``v``,
  type ``help(v)`` in the Python interactive interpreter to read the help entry for this kind of object.
* WordNet is a semantically-oriented dictionary of English, consisting of synonym sets |mdash| or synsets |mdash|
  and organized into a network.
* Some functions are not available by default, but must be accessed using
  Python's ``import`` statement.

   What problem might arise with this approach?
   Can you suggest a way to avoid this problem?

#. |easy| According to Strunk and White's *Elements of Style*,

#. |soso| Define a conditional frequency distribution over the Names corpus
   that allows you to see which *initial* letters are more frequent for males
   vs. females (cf. fig-cfd-gender_).

#. |soso| Pick a pair of texts and study the differences between them,
   in terms of vocabulary, vocabulary richness, genre, etc.  Can you
   find pairs of words which have quite different meanings across the
   two texts, such as `monstrous`:lx: in *Moby Dick* and in *Sense and Sensibility*?

#. |soso| Read the BBC News article: *UK's Vicky Pollards 'left behind'* ``http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6173441.stm``.
   The article gives the following statistic about teen language:
   "the top 20 words used, including yeah, no, but and like, account for around a third of all words."
   How many word types account for a third
   of all word tokens, for a variety of text sources?  What do you conclude about this statistic?
   Read more about this on *LanguageLog*, at ``http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003993.html``.

#. |soso| Investigate the table of modal distributions and look for other patterns.
   Try to explain them in terms of your own impressionistic understanding
   of the different genres.  Can you find other closed classes of words that
   exhibit significant differences across different genres?

#. |soso| The CMU Pronouncing Dictionary contains multiple pronunciations
   for certain words.  How many distinct words does it contain?  What fraction
   of words in this dictionary have more than one possible pronunciation?

#. |soso| What percentage of noun synsets have no hyponyms?
   You can get all noun synsets using ``wn.all_synsets('n')``.

#. |soso| Define a function ``supergloss(s)`` that takes a synset ``s`` as its argument
   and returns a string consisting of the concatenation of the definition of ``s``, and
   the definitions of all the hypernyms and hyponyms of ``s``.

#. |soso| Write a program to find all words that occur at least three times in the Brown Corpus.

#. |soso| Write a program to generate a table of lexical diversity scores (i.e. token/type ratios), as we saw in
   tab-brown-types_.  Include the full set of Brown Corpus genres (``nltk.corpus.brown.categories()``).
   Which genre has the lowest diversity (greatest number of tokens per type)?
   Is this what you would have expected?

#. |soso| Write a function that finds the 50 most frequently occurring words
   of a text that are not stopwords.

#. |soso| Write a program to print the 50 most frequent bigrams
   (pairs of adjacent words) of a text, omitting bigrams that contain stopwords.

#. |soso| Write a program to create a table of word frequencies by genre,
   like the one given in _sec-extracting-text-from-corpora for modals.
   Choose your own words and try to find words whose presence
   (or absence) is typical of a genre.  Discuss your findings.

#. |soso| Write a function ``word_freq()`` that takes a word and the name of a section
   of the Brown Corpus as arguments, and computes the frequency of the word
   in that section of the corpus.

#. |soso| Write a program to guess the number of syllables contained in a text,
   making use of the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary.

#. |soso| Define a function ``hedge(text)`` which processes a
   text and produces a new version with the word
   ``'like'`` between every third word.

#. |hard| **Zipf's Law**:
   Let *f(w)* be the frequency of a word *w* in free text. Suppose that
   all the words of a text are ranked according to their frequency,
   with the most frequent word first. Zipf's law states that the
   frequency of a word type is inversely proportional to its rank
   (i.e. *f* |times| *r = k*, for some constant *k*). For example, the 50th most
   common word type should occur three times as frequently as the
   150th most common word type.

   a) Write a function to process a large text and plot word
      frequency against word rank using ``pylab.plot``. Do
      you confirm Zipf's law? (Hint: it helps to use a logarithmic scale).
      What is going on at the extreme ends of the plotted line?

   #) Generate random text, e.g., using ``random.choice("abcdefg ")``,
      taking care to include the space character.  You will need to
      ``import random`` first.  Use the string
      concatenation operator to accumulate characters into a (very)
      long string.  Then tokenize this string, and generate the Zipf
      plot as before, and compare the two plots.  What do you make of
      Zipf's Law in the light of this?

#. |hard| Modify the text generation program in code-random-text_ further, to
   do the following tasks:
   
   a) Store the *n* most likely words in a list ``words`` then randomly
      choose a word from the list using ``random.choice()``.  (You will need
      to ``import random`` first.)
      
   b) Select a particular genre, such as a section of the Brown Corpus,
      or a genesis translation, one of the Gutenberg texts, or one of the Web texts.  Train
      the model on this corpus and get it to generate random text.  You
      may have to experiment with different start words. How intelligible
      is the text?  Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this method of
      generating random text.
      
   c) Now train your system using two distinct genres and experiment
      with generating text in the hybrid genre.  Discuss your observations.

#. |hard| Define a function ``find_language()`` that takes a string
   as its argument, and returns a list of languages that have that
   string as a word.  Use the ``udhr`` corpus and limit your searches
   to files in the Latin-1 encoding.

#. |hard| What is the branching factor of the noun hypernym hierarchy?
   I.e. for every noun synset that has hyponyms |mdash| or children in the
   hypernym hierarchy |mdash| how many do they have on average?
   You can get all noun synsets using ``wn.all_synsets('n')``.

#. |hard| The polysemy of a word is the number of senses it has.
   Using WordNet, we can determine that the noun *dog* has 7 senses
   with: ``len(wn.synsets('dog', 'n'))``.
   Compute the average polysemy of nouns, verbs, adjectives and
   adverbs according to WordNet.

#. |hard| Use one of the predefined similarity measures to score
   the similarity of each of the following pairs of words.
   Rank the pairs in order of decreasing similarity.
   How close is your ranking to the order given here,
   an order that was established experimentally
