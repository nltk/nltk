 For example , one of my favorite movies is the 1949 British comedy `` Kind Hearts and Coronets , '' in which the entire comedy is based [*-1] on actor Dennis Price 's murdering eight titled relatives ( all played [*] by Alec Guinness ) because they snubbed his mother and stand in the way of his acquiring the family title [*T*-2] .
