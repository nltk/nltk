Not sure about the instrument arg; that's brought in from the

Beautiful etymology behind this.  During the Industrial Revolution in
France, disgruntled (and displaced) workers would toss their wooden
shoes, called &quot;sabot&quot;s, into the machinery of the new factories,
naturally causing the machinery to break.  This kind of willful
destruction came to be called sabot-age.
