<note>
Frames file for 'poll' based on sentences in financial subcorpus and
automatic expansion via verbnet.  Well, not actually, b/c Levin
includes this in the 'pit' class which doesn't make any sense to me.
Comparison with 'question' instead.  Note that args 1 and 2 have been
reversed from 'question'
