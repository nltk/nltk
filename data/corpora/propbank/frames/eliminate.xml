    The plan calls for *trace* closing at least nine plants and
    eliminating about 3,600 jobs.

        <rel>eliminating</rel>
        <arg n="1">about 3,600 jobs</arg>

<note>
The plan isn't doing the eliminating, but rather some unnamed company
which will be implementing the plan.  But close enough.

<example name="untraceable subject">
<text>
    However, third-quarter operating profit fell 14%, as USX sold
    sizable chunks of its diversified and steel segments, *trace*
    eliminating income from those operations. 
</text>
        <arg n="0">*trace*</arg>
        <rel>eliminating</rel>
        <arg n="1">income from those operations</arg>
</example>

<note>
The subject of eliminate is &quot;USX sold sizable chunks of its
diversified and steel segments&quot;, but the syntax will not allow that
string to be selected as target of the trace.  So leave the trace with
no target.
