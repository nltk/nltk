     Appropriations committees have used an assortment of devices to
     disguise as much as $1 billion in spending, and as critics have
     reawakened to these devices, the bill can seem like a wounded
     caribou trying to make it past ice and wolves to reach safer
     winter grazing.

     The short-term shift in the political climate surrounding
     abortion reflects two factors that are likely to govern the
     debate in the next several months: the reawakening of the
     abortion-rights movement as a potent force after years of
     lassitude, and the ability of each side to counter the other's
     advance in one arena with a victory of its own elsewhere.
