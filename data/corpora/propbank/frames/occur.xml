<example name="ergative">
  <text>
    Volatility surrounding his trades occurs not because of index
    arbitrage, but because his is a large addition or subtraction to a
    widget market with finite liquidity.

  <rel>occurs</rel>
  <arg f="CAU" n="m">not because of index
    arbitrage, but because his is a large addition or subtraction to a
    widget market with finite liquidity.</arg>
</example>

<note>
The corresponding sense of 'happen' shows an Arg2 'benefactive', with
prepositions 'with' and 'for'.  I didn't see any in the financial
subcorpus, but they might occur.  Maybe.
