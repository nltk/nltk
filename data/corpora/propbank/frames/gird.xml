<note>
The arg1 above would properly be &quot;itself&quot;.  This sense is actually an
extension of the other; literally 'gird' means 'to put on a belt.'
Originally the belt carried one's weapons; thus to 'gird for battle'
used a purpose phrase, which gradually became more prominent until the
new sense took over.
