<note>
  Frames file for 'dominate' based on sentences in financial
  subcorpus.  Verbnet class contiguous_location-47.8, other framed
  members include 'contain' 'cover' 'fill' 'support' and 'top'.  I
  don't think those are the sense 'dominate' is usually used in,
  though.  Using 'surpass' sense of 'top'.

<note>
Could take an arg2 'instrument' (&quot;John dominates any room with his
overwhelming B.O.&quot;) but we'll wait to see what the corpus says.
