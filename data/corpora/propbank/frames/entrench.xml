<text>
    Royal's suit contends that the Ammann acquisition was ``designed
    *trace* to entrench management and thwart Royal's offer.''

<note>
Ignore adjectival usages: &quot;management's entrenched position&quot;.  Also, I
don't know for sure that the position will ever be mentioned, but the
framing is there in case we do see it.
