<note>
As with 'surprise', the line between verbal passives and adjectivals
is almost nonexistent.  Note, for example, that the Ford example above
can be easily paraphrased as &quot;That Ford didn't move to tender a bid
for control of the company disappointed the market.&quot;  (For this
reason, the complementizer MUST be included in the arg.)
