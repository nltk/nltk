    *trace* To mollify shareholders concerned about the long-term
     value of the company under the BellSouth-LIN agreement, BellSouth
     also agreed to pay as much as $10 a share, or $540 million, if,
     after five years, the trading value of the new cellular company
     is n't as high as the value that shareholders would have realized
     from the McCaw offer.

<note>
I've always thought 'mollify' should also mean &quot;make someone be
Molly&quot;, but that never seems to occur.
