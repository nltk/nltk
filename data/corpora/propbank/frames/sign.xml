  John was signed to the Mudville Giants.
  </text>
  <arg n="2">John</arg>
  <rel>signed</rel>
  <arg f="to" n="1">the Mudville Giants</arg>
<note>
The logic here is that John is the cosigner of an agreement, under
which he will play with the Mudville Giants.  Maybe it makes sense,
maybe it doesn't.  Maybe it will occur, maybe it won't.
