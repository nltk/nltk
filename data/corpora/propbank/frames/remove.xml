    In a surprise move, the British government cleared the way for a

<note>
Note that the last example could be rephrased as &quot;...removes the
British government from being an impediment...&quot; or &quot;...removes the
British government from its role as an impediment...&quot; or whatever.
That shows that the as-phrase is the same as a from-phrase.
