      In a lovely, novelistic memoir, ``Sleeping Arrangements''
      (Knopf, 195 pages, $18.95), she remembers an exotic playground,
      peopled [*] mainly by Jewish eccentrics and the occasional
      Catholic (real oddballs like her sexpot friend, the hell-kitten
      Diana, age five).

Populate can take an agent, but people cannot (to my mind); hence the
arg numbering.
