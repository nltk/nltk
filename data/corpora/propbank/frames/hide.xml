  Frames file for 'hide' based on sentence in financial subcorpus.
  Verbnet entry 16, no other framed members.  Levin probably puts it
  in the 'pit' class also, as in &quot;I hided the deer&quot; = &quot;I took the hide
  off the deer&quot; but I can't accept that.

    The contributions were funded by monthly payments of $1,000 to
    $2,000 to Appleyard in the guise of a ``special production fee''
    -- in effect, *trace* hiding the nature of the payments from the
    Internal Revenue Service, federal prosecutors said.

<note>
Actually that's a bad target for the trace, but there's nothing better
available b/c of the syntax.  Oh well.

The assumption here is that there's an unstated &quot;himself&quot; in the arg1
