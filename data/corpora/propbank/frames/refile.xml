    University Patents refiled a suit in federal court in Philadelphia
    against Albert M. Kligman.
  </text>
  <arg n="0">University Patents</arg>
  <rel>refiled</rel>
  <arg n="1">a suit</arg>

  <arg f="against" n="3">Albert M. Kligman</arg>

<note>
Sometimes the against phrase is included in the suit phrase.  You'll
therefore need to delve deeper into the syntax to divide the two args.

  <text>
    Documents refiled *trace* with the Securities and Exchange
    Commission on the pending spinoff...
  </text>
  <arg n="1">*trace=Documents*</arg>
  <rel>refiled</rel>
  <arg f="with" n="2">the Securities and Exchange Commission</arg>
  <arg n="m">on the pending spinoff</arg>
</example>

<note>
This happens a lot, with something that looks (syntactically) like an
argument of &quot;refile&quot; but is actually a modifier of the head NP--really 
--this is &quot;documents on the pending spinoff were refiled with the SEC&quot; 
--but the syntax has been bollixed.  Use ArgM for all these.

    One or more airlines have refiled for protection from creditors.

<note>
The difference between this and the Arg-4 &quot;purpose&quot; is that in this
case the paperwork cannot be mentioned.  With the roleset id=&quot;refile.03&quot; above, the
paperwork need not be mentioned, but can be.  Other arguments
(refiled-with, refiled-against) will probably be mentioned.
