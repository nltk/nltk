<note>
PReditor picks up prepositional usages of &quot;like&quot; (meaning &quot;such as&quot;
and tagged as adjective) which should be ignored.  Even worse,
&quot;unlike&quot; is picked up and included in the .arch files, so you'll see
some sentences which at first glance seem to have no &quot;like&quot; predicates
at all.

<note>
This proves that &quot;like&quot; cannot be treated as a modal, because English
doesn't otherwise allow two modal verbs in a single sentences (with
the exception of certain dialects, notably Southern, which might could
say such things).
