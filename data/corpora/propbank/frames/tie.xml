<note>
This almost seems like a phrasal verb, but since the &quot;together&quot; now
describes the state of the object-of-tying, let's treat it as an
attributive.  Note that the same is not true of &quot;tie up&quot; &quot;tie down&quot;,
etc.  These will take the same roleset as plain old &quot;tie&quot;, except for
the attribute.

     The pithiest testimony to their domination of the just-concluded
