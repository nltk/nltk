It/pps is/bez difficult/jj to/to pinpoint/vb the/at time/nn of/in origin/nn of/in the/at state/nn purchasing/vbg automobiles/nns for/in use/nn of/in employees/nns in/in Rhode/np-tl Island/nn-tl ./.
Few/ap records/nns are/ber available/jj concerning/in the/at subject/nn prior/rb to/in 1940/cd ./.
Those/dts that/wps are/ber available/jj shed/vb little/ap light/nn ./.
The/at Registry/nn-tl of/in-tl Motor/nn-tl Vehicles/nns-tl indicates/vbz that/cs at/in least/ap one/cd state/nn automobile/nn was/bedz registered/vbn as/ql far/rb back/rb as/cs 1917/cd ./.
It/pps should/md be/be enough/ap to/to say/vb that/cs the/at practice/nn of/in the/at state/nn buying/vbg automobiles/nns is/bez at/in least/ap forty/cd years/nns old/jj ./.


	The/at best/jjt reason/nn that/wpo can/md be/be advanced/vbn for/in the/at state/nn adopting/vbg the/at practice/nn was/bedz the/at advent/nn of/in expanded/vbn highway/nn construction/nn during/in the/at 1920s/nns and/cc '30s/nns ./.
At/in that/dt time/nn highway/nn engineers/nns traveled/vbd rough/jj and/cc dirty/jj roads/nns to/to accomplish/vb their/pp$ duties/nns ./.

	Once/cs the/at principle/nn was/bedz established/vbn ,/, the/at increase/nn in/in state-owned/jj vehicles/nns came/vbd rapidly/rb ./.
And/cc reasons/nns other/ap than/cs employee/nn need/nn contributed/vbd to/in the/at growth/nn ./.
Table/nn-tl 1/cd-tl immediately/rb below/rb shows/vbz the/at rate/nn of/in growth/nn of/in vehicles/nns and/cc employees/nns ./.
This/dt rate/nn of/in increase/nn does/doz not/* signify/vb anything/pn in/in itself/ppl ./.
It/pps does/doz not/* indicate/vb loose/jj management/nn ,/, ineffective/jj controls/nns or/cc poor/jj policy/nn ./.
But/cc it/pps does/doz show/vb that/cs automobiles/nns have/hv increased/vbn steadily/rb over/in the/at years/nns and/cc in/in almost/rb the/at same/ap proportion/nn to/in the/at increase/nn of/in state/nn employees/nns ./.
In/in the/at past/ap twenty/cd years/nns the/at ratio/nn of/in state-owned/jj automobiles/nns per/in state/nn employees/nns has/hvz varied/vbn from/in 1/cd to/in 22/cd then/rb to/in 1/cd to/in 23/cd now/rb ./.

History/nn-hl and/cc-hl operation/nn-hl of/in-hl the/at-hl motor/nn-hl pool/nn-hl ./.-hl

While/cs the/at origin/nn of/in state-owned/jj automobiles/nns may/md be/be obscured/vbn ,/, subsequent/jj developments/nns concerning/in the/at assignment/nn ,/, use/nn ,/, and/cc management/nn of/in state/nn automobiles/nns can/md be/be related/vbn more/ql clearly/rb ./.
Prior/rb to/in 1942/cd ,/, automobiles/nns were/bed the/at individual/jj responsibility/nn of/in the/at agency/nn to/in which/wdt assigned/vbn ./.
This/dt responsibility/nn included/vbd all/abn phases/nns of/in management/nn ./.
It/pps embraced/vbd determining/vbg when/wrb to/to purchase/vb and/cc when/wrb to/to trade/vb vehicles/nns ,/, who/wps was/bedz to/to drive/vb ,/, when/wrb and/cc where/wrb repairs/nns were/bed to/to be/be made/vbn ,/, where/wrb gasoline/nn and/cc automobile/nn services/nns were/bed to/to be/be obtained/vbn and/cc other/ap allied/vbn matters/nns ./.
In/in 1942/cd ,/, however/rb ,/, the/at nation/nn was/bedz at/in war/nn ./.
Gasoline/nn and/cc automobile/nn tires/nns were/bed rationed/vbn commodities/nns ./.
The/at state/nn was/bedz confronted/vbn with/in transportation/nn problems/nns similar/jj to/in those/dts of/in the/at individual/nn ./.
It/pps met/vbd these/dts problems/nns by/in the/at creation/nn of/in the/at state/nn automobile/nn maintenance/nn unit/nn (/( more/ql popularly/rb called/vbn the/at motor/nn pool/nn )/) ,/, a/at centralized/vbn operation/nn for/in the/at maintenance/nn and/cc control/nn of/in all/abn state/nn transportation/nn ./.
The/at motor/nn pool/nn then/rb ,/, as/cs now/rb ,/, had/hvd headquarter/nn facilities/nns in/in Providence/np and/cc other/ap garages/nns located/vbn throughout/in the/at state/nn ./.
It/pps was/bedz organizationally/rb the/at responsibility/nn of/in the/at Department/nn-tl of/in-tl Public/jj-tl Works/nns-tl and/cc was/bedz financed/vbn on/in a/at rotary/jj fund/nn basis/nn with/in each/dt agency/nn of/in government/nn contributing/vbg to/in the/at pool's/nn$ operation/nn ./.
In/in 1951/cd the/at pool's/nn$ operation/nn was/bedz transferred/vbn to/in the/at newly-created/jj Department/nn-tl of/in-tl Administration/nn-tl ,/, an/at agency/nn established/vbn as/cs the/at central/jj staff/nn and/cc auxiliary/jj department/nn of/in the/at state/nn government/nn ./.
The/at management/nn of/in state-owned/jj vehicles/nns since/in that/dt time/nn has/hvz been/ben described/vbn in/in a/at recent/jj report/nn in/in the/at following/vbg manner/nn :/: ``/`` 

	Under/in this/dt new/jj management/nn considerable/jj progress/nn appears/vbz to/to have/hv been/ben made/vbn ./.
The/at agencies/nns of/in government/nn are/ber now/rb billed/vbn for/in the/at actual/jj cost/nn of/in services/nns provided/vbn to/in each/dt passenger/nn car/nn rather/in than/in the/at prior/jj uniform/jj charge/nn for/in all/abn cars/nns ./.
Whereas/cs the/at maintenance/nn rotary/jj fund/nn had/hvd in/in the/at past/nn sustained/vbn losses/nns considerably/rb beyond/in expectations/nns ,/, the/at introduction/nn of/in the/at cost-billing/nn system/nn plus/cc other/ap control/nn refinements/nns has/hvz resulted/vbn in/in keeping/vbg the/at fund/nn on/in a/at proper/jj working/vbg basis/nn ./.
One/cd indication/nn of/in the/at merits/nns of/in the/at new/jj management/nn is/bez found/vbn in/in the/at fact/nn that/cs during/in the/at period/nn 1951-1956/cd ,/, while/cs total/jj annual/jj mileage/nn put/vbn on/in the/at vehicles/nns increased/vbd 35%/nn ,/, the/at total/jj maintenance/nn cost/nn increased/vbd only/rb 11%/nn ./.
``/`` 

	In/in order/nn to/to further/rbr refine/vb the/at management/nn of/in passenger/nn vehicles/nns ,/, on/in July/np 1/cd ,/, 1958/cd ,/, the/at actual/jj title/nn to/in every/at vehicle/nn was/bedz transferred/vbn ,/, by/in Executive/jj-tl Order/nn-tl ,/, to/in the/at Division/nn-tl of/in-tl Methods/nns-tl ,/, Research/nn-tl and/cc-tl Office/nn-tl Services/nns-tl ./.
The/at objective/nn behind/in this/dt action/nn was/bedz to/to place/vb in/in one/cd agency/nn the/at responsibility/nn for/in the/at management/nn ,/, assignment/nn ,/, and/cc replacement/nn of/in all/abn vehicles/nns ./.
(/( Note/vb :/: So/ql far/rb as/cs State/nn-tl Police/nns-tl cars/nns are/ber concerned/vbn ,/, only/rb their/pp$ replacement/nn is/bez under/in this/dt division/nn )/) ./.
This/dt tied/vbd in/rp closely/rb with/in the/at current/jj attempt/nn to/to upgrade/vb state-owned/jj cars/nns to/in the/at extent/nn that/cs vehicles/nns are/ber not/* retained/vbn beyond/in the/at point/nn where/wrb maintenance/nn costs/nns (/( in/in light/nn of/in depreciation/nn )/) become/vb excessive/jj ./.
Moreover/rb ,/, it/pps allows/vbz the/at present/jj management/nn to/to reassign/vb vehicles/nns so/cs that/cs mileage/nn will/md be/be more/ql uniformly/rb distributed/vbn throughout/in the/at fleet/nn ;/. ;/.
for/in example/nn ,/, if/cs one/cd driver/nn puts/vbz on/rp 22,000/cd miles/nns per/in year/nn and/cc another/dt driver/nn 8,000/cd miles/nns per/in year/nn ,/, their/pp$ cars/nns will/md be/be switched/vbn so/cs that/cs both/abx cars/nns will/md have/hv 30,000/cd miles/nns after/in two/cd years/nns ,/, rather/in than/in 44,000/cd miles/nns (/( and/cc related/vbn higher/jjr maintenance/nn costs/nns )/) and/cc 16,000/cd miles/nns respectively/rb ''/'' ./.


	The/at motor/nn pool/nn is/bez a/at completely/ql centralized/vbn and/cc mechanized/vbn operation/nn ./.
It/pps handles/vbz all/abn types/nns of/in vehicle/nn maintenance/nn ,/, but/cc concentrates/vbz more/rbr on/in ``/`` service/nn station/nn activities/nns ''/'' than/cs on/in extensive/jj vehicle/nn repairs/nns ./.
It/pps contracts/vbz with/in outside/jj repair/nn garages/nns for/in much/ap of/in the/at latter/ap work/nn ./.
Where/wrb the/at pool/nn excels/vbz is/bez in/in its/pp$ compilation/nn of/in maintenance/nn and/cc cost-data/nn studies/nns and/cc analyses/nns ./.
Pool/nn records/nns reveal/vb in/in detail/nn the/at cost/nn per/in mile/nn and/cc miles/nns per/in gallon/nn of/in each/dt vehicle/nn ,/, the/at miles/nns traveled/vbn in/in one/cd year/nn or/cc three/cd years/nns ,/, the/at periods/nns when/wrb vehicle/nn costs/nns become/vb excessive/jj ,/, and/cc when/wrb cars/nns should/md be/be traded/vbn for/in sound/jj economies/nns ./.
From/in this/dt ,/, motor/nn pool/nn personnel/nns develop/vb other/ap meaningful/jj and/cc related/vbn data/nn ./.
In/in 1959-60/cd ,/, vehicles/nns averaged/vbd an/at operating/vbg cost/nn of/in $.027/nns per/in mile/nn ./.
Based/vbn on/in this/dt figure/nn and/cc considering/vbg depreciation/nn costs/nns of/in vehicles/nns ,/, pool/nn personnel/nns have/hv determined/vbn that/cs travel/nn in/in excess/nn of/in 10,000/cd miles/nns annually/rb is/bez more/ql economical/jj by/in state/nn car/nn than/cs by/in payment/nn of/in allowances/nns for/in use/nn of/in personally-owned/jj vehicles/nns ./.
They/ppss estimate/vb further/rbr that/cs with/in sufficient/jj experience/nn and/cc when/wrb cost-data/nn of/in compact/jj cars/nns is/bez compiled/vbn ,/, the/at break-even/jj point/nn may/md be/be reduced/vbn to/in 7,500/cd miles/nns of/in travel/nn per/in year/nn ./.
Table/nn-tl 2/cd-tl shows/vbz operating/vbg cost/nn data/nn of/in state/nn vehicles/nns selected/vbn at/in random/nn ./.


	One/cd matter/nn of/in concern/nn to/in the/at complete/jj effectiveness/nn of/in pool/nn operations/nns is/bez the/at lack/nn of/in adequate/jj central/jj garage/nn facilities/nns ./.
Present/jj pool/nn quarters/nns at/in two/cd locations/nns in/in Providence/np are/ber crowded/vbn ,/, antiquated/jj and/cc ,/, in/in general/jj ,/, make/vb for/in inefficient/jj operation/nn in/in terms/nns of/in dispersement/nn of/in personnel/nns and/cc duplication/nn of/in such/jj operational/jj needs/nns as/cs stock/nn and/cc repair/nn equipment/nn ./.
