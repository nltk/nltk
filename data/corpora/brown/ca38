	The/at-tl Masters/nns-tl golf/nn tournament/nn proved/vbd last/ap Monday/nr what/wdt it/pps can/md do/do to/in the/at strongest/jjt men/nns and/cc the/at staunchest/jjt nerves/nns ./.
Gary/np Player/np ,/, the/at small/jj ,/, trim/jj South/jj-tl African/np-tl ,/, was/bedz the/at eventual/jj winner/nn ,/, but/cc in/in all/abn his/pp$ 25/cd years/nns he/pps never/rb spent/vbd a/at more/ql harrowing/jj afternoon/nn as/cs he/pps waited/vbd for/in the/at victory/nn to/to drop/vb in/in his/pp$ lap/nn ./.
Arnold/np Palmer/np ,/, the/at defending/vbg champion/nn ,/, lost/vbd his/pp$ title/nn on/in the/at 72nd/od hole/nn after/in a/at few/ap minutes/nns of/in misfortune/nn that/wps left/vbd even/rb his/pp$ fellow/nn pros/nns gaping/vbg in/in disbelief/nn ./.


	``/`` Just/rb when/wrb you/ppss think/vb you/ppo have/hv it/ppo licked/vbn ,/, this/dt golf/nn course/nn can/md get/vb up/rp and/cc bite/vb you/ppo ''/'' ,/, Player/np had/hvd said/vbn one/cd afternoon/nn midway/ql through/in the/at tournament/nn ./.
And/cc that/dt is/bez just/rb what/wdt happened/vbd on/in the/at last/ap few/ap holes/nns ./.
The/at Augusta/np-tl National/jj-tl Golf/nn-tl Club/nn-tl Course/nn-tl got/vbd up/rp and/cc bit/vbd both/abx Player/np and/cc Palmer/np ./.


	Player/np was/bedz the/at first/od to/to feel/vb its/pp$ teeth/nns ./.
After/cs playing/vbg a/at splendid/jj first/od nine/cd holes/nns in/in 34/cd --/-- two/cd strokes/nns under/in par/nn --/-- on/in this/dt fifth/od and/cc final/jj day/nn of/in the/at tournament/nn (/( Sunday's/nr$ fourth/od round/nn had/hvd been/ben washed/vbn out/rp by/in a/at violent/jj rainstorm/nn when/wrb it/pps was/bedz only/ql half/ql completed/vbn )/) ,/, Player's/np$ game/nn rapidly/rb fell/vbd to/in pieces/nns ./.
He/pps bogeyed/vbd the/at 10th/od ./.
After/cs a/at journey/nn through/in woods/nns and/cc stream/nn he/pps double-bogeyed/vbd the/at 13th/od ./.
He/pps bogeyed/vbd the/at 15th/od by/in missing/vbg a/at short/jj putt/nn and/cc finally/rb scrambled/vbd through/in the/at last/ap three/cd holes/nns without/in further/jjr mishap/nn for/in a/at 2-over-par/jj 74/cd and/cc a/at 72-hole/jj total/nn of/in 280/cd ./.


	As/cs he/pps signed/vbd his/pp$ scorecard/nn and/cc walked/vbd off/in the/at course/nn ,/, Player/np was/bedz almost/ql in/in tears/nns ./.
He/pps could/md read/vb on/in the/at nearby/jj scoreboard/nn that/cs Palmer/np ,/, by/in then/rb playing/vbg the/at 15th/od hole/nn ,/, was/bedz leading/vbg him/ppo by/in a/at stroke/nn ./.
Palmer/np had/hvd started/vbn the/at round/nn four/cd strokes/nns behind/in Player/np ,/, and/cc at/in one/cd point/nn in/in the/at afternoon/nn had/hvd trailed/vbn by/in as/ql many/ap as/cs six/cd strokes/nns ./.
Now/rb all/abn he/pps had/hvd to/to do/do was/bedz finish/vb in/in even/jj par/nn to/to collect/vb the/at trophy/nn and/cc the/at biggest/jjt single/ap paycheck/nn in/in golf/nn ./.


	When/wrb Palmer/np hit/vbd a/at good/jj straight/jj drive/nn up/in the/at fairway/nn on/in the/at 72nd/od hole/nn ,/, he/pps seemed/vbd to/to have/hv the/at championship/nn won/vbn ./.
But/cc the/at seven-iron/nn shot/nn he/pps used/vbd to/to approach/vb the/at green/nn strayed/vbd into/in a/at bunker/nn and/cc lodged/vbd in/in a/at slight/jj depression/nn ./.
In/in trying/vbg to/to hit/vb it/ppo out/rp with/in a/at sand/nn wedge/nn Palmer/np bounced/vbd the/at ball/nn over/in the/at green/nn ,/, past/in spectators/nns and/cc down/in the/at slope/nn toward/in a/at TV/nn tower/nn ./.


	Afterwards/rb ,/, Palmer/np told/vbd Charlie/np Coe/np ,/, his/pp$ last-round/nn partner/nn ,/, that/cs he/pps simply/rb played/vbd the/at hole/nn too/ql fast/rb ./.
He/pps did/dod seem/vb hasty/jj on/in his/pp$ second/od and/cc third/od shots/nns ,/, but/cc then/rb there/ex was/bedz an/at agonizing/jj wait/nn of/in several/ap minutes/nns while/cs Coe/np graciously/rb putted/vbd out/rp ,/, giving/vbg Palmer/np a/at chance/nn to/to recover/vb his/pp$ composure/nn ,/, which/wdt he/pps had/hvd quite/ql visibly/rb lost/vbn ./.


	When/wrb the/at shaken/vbn Palmer/np finally/rb did/dod hit/vb his/pp$ fourth/od shot/nn ,/, he/pps overshot/vbd the/at hole/nn by/in 15/cd feet/nns ./.
Palmer/np was/bedz now/rb putting/vbg merely/rb for/in a/at tie/nn ,/, and/cc Player/np ,/, who/wps was/bedz sitting/vbg beside/in his/pp$ wife/nn and/cc watching/vbg it/ppo all/abn on/in television/nn in/in Tournament/nn-tl Chairman/nn-tl Clifford/np Roberts'/np$ clubhouse/nn apartment/nn ,/, stared/vbd in/in amazement/nn when/wrb Palmer/np missed/vbd the/at putt/nn ./.


	Palmer's/np$ 281/cd for/in the/at four/cd rounds/nns at/in Augusta/np was/bedz a/at comfortable/jj four/cd strokes/nns ahead/rb of/in the/at next/ql closest/jjt pro/nn ,/, but/cc it/pps was/bedz barely/ql good/jj enough/qlp for/in a/at second-place/nn tie/nn with/in Coe/np ./.
The/at lean/jj and/cc leathery/jj Oklahoma/np amateur/nn ,/, who/wps has/hvz been/ben playing/vbg topnotch/nn tournament/nn golf/nn for/in many/ap years/nns ,/, refused/vbd to/to let/vb the/at Masters/nns-tl jitters/nns overtake/vb him/ppo and/cc closed/vbd the/at tournament/nn with/in his/pp$ second/od straight/jj 69/cd ./.



End/nn-hl at/in-hl seven/cd-hl 
Until/in late/jj last/ap Saturday/nr afternoon/nn Palmer/np had/hvd played/vbn seven/cd consecutive/jj rounds/nns of/in golf/nn at/in the/at Masters/nns-tl --/-- four/cd last/ap year/nn and/cc three/cd this/dt --/-- without/in ever/rb being/beg out/in of/in first/od place/nn ./.
As/cs evening/nn approached/vbd and/cc Palmer/np finished/vbd his/pp$ Saturday/nr round/nn with/in a/at disappointing/jj one-over-par/nn 73/cd ,/, this/dt remarkable/jj record/nn was/bedz still/rb intact/jj ,/, thanks/nns to/in his/pp$ Thursday/nr and/cc Friday/nr rounds/nns of/in 68/cd and/cc 69/cd ./.
His/pp$ three-round/jj total/nn of/in 210/cd was/bedz three/cd strokes/nns better/jjr than/cs the/at next/ap best/jjt score/nn ,/, a/at 213/cd by/in Bill/np Collins/np ,/, the/at tall/jj and/cc deliberate/jj Baltimorean/np who/wps had/hvd been/ben playing/vbg very/ql well/rb all/abn winter/nn long/jj ./.


	But/cc Palmer/np knew/vbd ,/, as/cs did/dod everybody/pn else/rb at/in Augusta/np ,/, that/cs his/pp$ streak/nn was/bedz about/rb to/to be/be broken/vbn ./.
Half/abn an/at hour/nn after/cs he/pps finished/vbd his/pp$ round/nn ,/, Player/np holed/vbd out/rp at/in the/at 18th/od green/nn with/in a/at 69/cd and/cc a/at three-round/jj total/nn of/in 206/cd ,/, four/cd strokes/nns ahead/rb of/in Palmer/np ./.


	More/ap than/cs a/at streak/nn had/hvd ended/vbn ./.
Long/jj after/cs the/at erratic/jj climate/nn and/cc the/at washed-out/jj final/jj round/nn on/in Sunday/nr have/hv become/vbn meteorological/jj footnotes/nns ,/, the/at 1961/cd Masters/nns-tl will/md be/be remembered/vbn as/cs the/at scene/nn of/in the/at mano/fw-nn a/fw-in mano/fw-nn between/in Arnold/np Palmer/np and/cc Gary/np Player/np ./.
Unlike/in most/ap such/jj sports/nns rivalries/nns ,/, it/pps appeared/vbd to/to have/hv developed/vbn almost/ql spontaneously/rb ,/, although/cs this/dt was/bedz not/* exactly/rb the/at case/nn ./.


	When/wrb the/at winter/nn tour/nn began/vbd at/in Los/np Angeles/np last/ap January/np there/ex was/bedz no/at one/pn in/in sight/nn to/to challenge/vb Palmer's/np$ towering/vbg prestige/nn ./.
As/cs if/cs to/to confirm/vb his/pp$ stature/nn ,/, he/pps quickly/rb won/vbd three/cd of/in the/at first/od eight/cd tournaments/nns ./.
Player/np won/vbd only/ap one/cd ./.
But/cc as/cs the/at tour/nn reached/vbd Pensacola/np a/at month/nn ago/rb ,/, Player/np was/bedz leading/vbg Palmer/np in/in official/jj winnings/nns by/in a/at few/ap hundred/cd dollars/nns ,/, and/cc the/at rest/nn of/in the/at field/nn was/bedz somewhere/rb off/rp in/in nowhere/rb ./.
On/in the/at final/jj round/nn at/in Pensacola/np ,/, the/at luck/nn of/in the/at draw/nn paired/vbd Palmer/np and/cc Player/np in/in the/at same/ap threesome/nn and/cc ,/, although/cs it/pps was/bedz far/rb from/in obvious/jj at/in the/at time/nn ,/, the/at gallery/nn was/bedz treated/vbn to/in the/at first/od chapter/nn of/in what/wdt promises/vbz to/to be/be one/cd of/in the/at most/ql exciting/jj duels/nns in/in sport/nn for/in a/at long/jj time/nn to/to come/vb ./.


	On/in that/dt final/jj Sunday/nr at/in Pensacola/np neither/cc Palmer/np nor/cc Player/np was/bedz leading/vbg the/at tournament/nn and/cc ,/, as/cs it/pps turned/vbd out/rp ,/, neither/dtx won/vbd it/ppo ./.
But/cc whichever/wdt of/in these/dts two/cd finished/vbd ahead/rb of/in the/at other/ap would/md be/be the/at undisputed/jj financial/jj leader/nn of/in the/at tour/nn ./.
Player/np immediately/rb proved/vbd he/pps was/bedz not/* in/in the/at least/ap awed/vbn by/in the/at dramatic/jj proximity/nn of/in Palmer/np ./.
He/pps outplayed/vbd Palmer/np all/ql around/in the/at course/nn and/cc finished/vbd with/in a/at tremendous/jj 65/cd to/in Palmer's/np$ 71/cd ./.
Thereafter/rb ,/, until/in the/at Masters/nns-tl ,/, Player/np gradually/rb increased/vbd his/pp$ lead/nn over/in Palmer/np in/in winnings/nns and/cc added/vbd one/cd more/ap tournament/nn victory/nn at/in Miami/np ./.
When/wrb they/ppss reached/vbd Augusta/np last/ap week/nn ,/, together/rb they/ppss had/hvd won/vbn five/cd of/in the/at 13/cd tournaments/nns to/in date/nn ./.



Instant/jj-hl rivalry/nn-hl 
On/in Thursday/nr ,/, the/at first/od day/nn of/in the/at Masters/nns-tl ,/, the/at contest/nn between/in Palmer/np and/cc Player/np developed/vbd instantly/rb ./.
It/pps was/bedz a/at dismal/jj ,/, drizzly/jj day/nn but/cc a/at good/jj one/cd on/in which/wdt to/to score/vb over/in the/at Augusta/np-tl National/jj-tl course/nn ./.
The/at usually/rb skiddy/jj greens/nns were/bed moist/jj and/cc soft/jj ,/, so/cs the/at golfers/nns were/bed able/jj to/to strike/vb their/pp$ approach/nn shots/nns boldly/rb at/in the/at flag-stick/nn and/cc putt/vb firmly/rb toward/in the/at hole/nn without/in too/ql much/ap worry/nn about/in the/at consequences/nns ./.
Palmer's/np$ 4-under-par/jj 68/cd got/vbd him/ppo off/rp to/in an/at early/jj lead/nn ,/, which/wdt he/pps shared/vbd with/in Bob/np Rosburg/np ./.
But/cc Player/np was/bedz only/rb one/cd stroke/nn back/rb ,/, with/in a/at 69/cd ./.


	Even/rb so/rb ,/, it/pps was/bedz still/rb not/* clear/jj to/in many/ap in/in the/at enormous/jj horde/nn of/in spectators/nns --/-- unquestionably/rb the/at largest/jjt golf/nn crowd/nn ever/rb --/-- that/cs this/dt tournament/nn was/bedz to/to be/be ,/, essentially/rb ,/, a/at match/nn between/in Palmer/np and/cc Player/np ./.
A/at lot/nn of/in people/nns were/bed still/rb thinking/vbg about/in Jack/np Nicklaus/np ,/, the/at spectacular/jj young/jj amateur/nn ,/, who/wps had/hvd a/at 70/cd ;/. ;/.
or/cc Ken/np Venturi/np ,/, who/wps had/hvd a/at somewhat/ql shaky/jj 72/cd but/cc was/bedz bound/vbn to/to do/do better/rbr ;/. ;/.
or/cc Rosburg/np ,/, whose/wp$ accurate/jj short/jj game/nn and/cc supersensitive/jj putter/nn can/md overcome/vb so/ql many/ap of/in Augusta's/np$ treacheries/nns ;/. ;/.
or/cc even/rb old/jj Byron/np Nelson/np ,/, whose/wp$ excellent/jj 71/cd made/vbd one/cd wonder/vb if/cs he/pps had/hvd solved/vbn the/at geriatric/jj aspects/nns of/in golf/nn ./.
(/( On/in Thursday/nr nobody/pn except/in Charlie/np Coe/np was/bedz thinking/vbg of/in Charlie/np Coe/np ./.
)/) 

	On/in Friday/nr ,/, a/at day/nn as/ql cloudless/jj and/cc lovely/jj as/cs Thursday/nr had/hvd been/ben gray/jj and/cc ugly/jj ,/, the/at plot/nn of/in the/at tournament/nn came/vbd clearly/rb into/in focus/nn ./.
Rosburg/np had/hvd started/vbn early/rb in/in the/at day/nn ,/, and/cc by/in the/at time/nn Palmer/np and/cc Player/np were/bed on/in the/at course/nn --/-- separated/vbn ,/, as/cs they/ppss were/bed destined/vbn to/to be/be for/in the/at rest/nn of/in the/at weekend/nn ,/, by/in about/rb half/abn an/at hour/nn --/-- they/ppss could/md see/vb on/in the/at numerous/jj scoreboards/nns spotted/vbn around/in the/at course/nn that/cs Rosburg/np ,/, who/wps ended/vbd with/in a/at 73/cd ,/, was/bedz not/* having/hvg a/at good/jj day/nn ./.


	As/cs Player/np began/vbd his/pp$ second/od round/nn in/in a/at twosome/nn with/in amateur/jj Bill/np Hyndman/np ,/, his/pp$ share/nn of/in the/at gallery/nn was/bedz not/* conspicuously/rb large/jj for/in a/at contender/nn ./.
Player/np began/vbd with/in a/at birdie/nn on/in the/at first/od hole/nn ,/, added/vbd five/cd straight/jj pars/nns and/cc then/rb another/dt birdie/nn at/in the/at 9th/od ./.
On/in the/at back/nn nine/cd he/pps began/vbd to/to acquire/vb the/at tidal/jj wave/nn of/in a/at gallery/nn that/wps stayed/vbd with/in him/ppo the/at rest/nn of/in the/at tournament/nn ./.
He/pps birdied/vbd the/at 13th/od ,/, the/at 15th/od and/cc the/at 18th/od --/-- five/cd birdies/nns ,/, one/cd bogey/nn and/cc 12/cd pars/nns for/in a/at 68/cd ./.


	Starting/vbg half/abn an/at hour/nn behind/in Player/np in/in company/nn with/in British/jj-tl Open/nn-tl Champion/nn-tl Kel/np Nagle/np ,/, Palmer/np birdied/vbd the/at 2nd/od ,/, the/at 9th/od ,/, the/at 13th/od and/cc the/at 16th/od --/-- four/cd birdies/nns ,/, one/cd bogey/nn and/cc 13/cd pars/nns for/in a/at 69/cd ./.
The/at roar/nn of/in Palmer's/np$ gallery/nn as/cs he/pps sank/vbd a/at thrilling/jj putt/nn would/md roll/vb out/rp across/in the/at parklike/jj landscape/nn of/in Augusta/np ,/, only/rb to/to be/be answered/vbn moments/nns later/rbr by/in the/at roar/nn of/in Player's/np$ gallery/nn for/in a/at similar/jj triumph/nn ./.
At/in one/cd point/nn late/rb in/in the/at day/nn ,/, when/wrb Palmer/np was/bedz lining/vbg up/rp a/at 25-foot/jj putt/nn on/in the/at 16th/od ,/, a/at thunderous/jj cheer/nn from/in the/at direction/nn of/in the/at 18th/od green/nn unmistakably/rb announced/vbd that/cs Player/np had/hvd birdied/vbn the/at final/jj hole/nn ./.
Without/in so/ql much/ap as/cs a/at grimace/nn or/cc a/at gesture/nn to/to show/vb that/cs he/pps had/hvd noticed/vbn (/( although/cs he/pps later/rbr admitted/vbd that/cs he/pps had/hvd )/) Palmer/np proceeded/vbd to/to sink/vb his/pp$ 25-footer/nn ,/, and/cc his/pp$ gallery/nn sent/vbd its/pp$ explosive/jj vocalization/nn rolling/vbg back/rb along/in the/at intervening/vbg fairways/nns in/in reply/nn ./.



The/at-hl boldness/nn-hl of/in-hl champions/nns-hl 
Anyone/pn who/wps now/rb doubted/vbd that/cs a/at personal/jj duel/nn was/bedz under/in way/nn had/hvd only/rb to/to watch/vb how/wrb these/dts exceptionally/rb gifted/jj golfers/nns were/bed playing/vbg this/dt most/ql difficult/jj golf/nn course/nn ./.
It/pps is/bez almost/ql axiomatic/jj that/cs golfers/nns who/wps dominate/vb the/at game/nn of/in golf/nn for/in any/dti period/nn of/in time/nn attack/vb their/pp$ shots/nns with/in a/at vehemence/nn bordering/vbg on/in violence/nn ./.
The/at bad/jj luck/nn that/wps can/md so/ql often/rb mar/vb a/at well-played/jj round/nn of/in golf/nn is/bez simply/rb overpowered/vbn and/cc obliterated/vbn by/in the/at contemptuous/jj boldness/nn of/in these/dts champions/nns ./.
Bob/np Jones/np played/vbd that/dt way/nn ./.
Byron/np Nelson/np did/dod ,/, Hogan/np did/dod ./.
And/cc last/ap week/nn at/in the/at Masters/nns-tl Palmer/np and/cc Player/np did/dod ./.


	As/cs the/at third/od round/nn of/in the/at tournament/nn began/vbd on/in Saturday/nr and/cc the/at duel/nn was/bedz resumed/vbn in/in earnest/jj ,/, it/pps was/bedz Player's/np$ superior/jj aggressiveness/nn that/wps carried/vbd him/ppo into/in the/at lead/nn ./.
This/dt day/nn Palmer/np had/hvd started/vbn first/rb ./.
As/cs Player/np stepped/vbd on/in the/at first/od tee/nn he/pps knew/vbd that/cs Palmer/np had/hvd birdied/vbn the/at first/od two/cd holes/nns and/cc already/rb was/bedz 2/cd under/in par/nn for/in the/at day/nn ./.
Player/np immediately/rb proceeded/vbd to/to follow/vb suit/nn ./.
In/in fact/nn ,/, he/pps went/vbd on/rp to/to birdie/vb the/at 6th/od and/cc 8th/od as/ql well/rb ,/, to/to go/vb 4/cd under/in par/nn for/in the/at first/od eight/cd holes/nns ./.


	But/cc Player's/np$ real/jj test/nn came/vbd on/in the/at ninth/od hole/nn ,/, a/at downhill/jj dogleg/nn to/in the/at left/nr measuring/vbg 420/cd yards/nns ./.
He/pps hit/vbd a/at poor/jj tee/nn shot/nn ,/, pulling/vbg it/ppo off/rp into/in the/at pine/nn woods/nns separating/vbg the/at 9th/od and/cc first/od fairways/nns ./.
Having/hvg hit/vbn one/cd of/in the/at trees/nns ,/, the/at ball/nn came/vbd to/in rest/nn not/* more/ap than/in 160/cd yards/nns out/rp ./.
Player/np then/rb had/hvd the/at choice/nn of/in punching/vbg the/at ball/nn safely/rb out/in of/in the/at woods/nns to/in the/at 9th/od fairway/nn and/cc settling/vbg for/in a/at bogey/nn 5/cd ,/, or/cc gambling/vbg ./.
The/at latter/ap involved/vbn hitting/vbg a/at full/jj four-wood/nn out/rp to/in the/at first/od fairway/nn and/cc toward/in the/at clubhouse/nn ,/, hoping/vbg to/to slice/vb it/ppo back/rb to/in the/at deeply/ql bunkered/vbn 9th/od green/nn ./.


	``/`` I/ppss was/bedz hitting/vbg the/at ball/nn well/rb ''/'' ,/, Player/np said/vbd later/rbr ,/, ``/`` and/cc I/ppss felt/vbd strong/jj ./.
When/wrb you're/ppss+ber playing/vbg like/cs that/dt you'd/ppss+md better/rbr attack/vb ''/'' ./.


	Player/np attacked/vbd with/in his/pp$ four-wood/nn and/cc hit/vb a/at shot/nn that/cs few/ap who/wps saw/vbd it/ppo will/md ever/rb forget/vb ./.
It/pps struck/vbd the/at 9th/od green/nn on/in the/at fly/nn and/cc stopped/vbd just/rb off/in the/at edge/nn ./.
From/in there/rb he/pps chipped/vbd back/rb and/cc sank/vbd his/pp$ putt/nn for/in a/at par/nn 4/cd ./.


	Palmer/np ,/, meanwhile/rb ,/, had/hvd been/ben having/hvg his/pp$ troubles/nns ./.
They/ppss started/vbd on/in the/at 4th/od hole/nn ,/, a/at 220-yard/jj par-3/nn ./.
On/in this/dt day/nn the/at wind/nn had/hvd switched/vbn 180-degrees/nns from/in the/at northwest/nr to/in the/at southeast/nr ,/, and/cc nearly/rb every/at shot/nn on/in the/at course/nn was/bedz different/jj from/in the/at previous/jj few/ap days/nns ./.
At/in the/at 4th/od tee/nn Palmer/np chose/vbd to/to hit/vb a/at one-iron/nn when/wrb a/at three-wood/jj was/bedz the/at proper/jj club/nn ,/, so/cs he/pps put/vbd the/at ball/nn in/in a/at bunker/nn in/in front/nn of/in the/at green/nn ./.
His/pp$ bogey/nn 4/cd on/in this/dt hole/nn and/cc subsequent/jj bogeys/nns at/in 5/cd and/cc 7/cd along/in with/in a/at birdie/nn at/in 8/cd brought/vbd him/ppo back/rb to/in even/jj par/nn ./.


	Starting/vbg the/at second/od nine/cd ,/, Palmer/np was/bedz already/rb four/cd strokes/nns behind/in Player/np and/cc knew/vbd it/ppo ./.
