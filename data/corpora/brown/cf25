	My/pp$ interviews/nns with/in teen-agers/nns confirmed/vbd this/dt portrait/nn of/in the/at weakening/nn of/in religious/jj and/cc ethnic/jj bonds/nns ./.
Jewish/jj identity/nn was/bedz often/rb confused/vbn with/in social/jj and/cc economic/jj strivings/nns ./.
``/`` Being/beg Jewish/jj gives/vbz you/ppo tremendous/jj drive/nn ''/'' ,/, a/at boy/nn remarked/vbd ./.
``/`` It/pps means/vbz that/cs you/ppss have/hv to/to get/vb ahead/rb ''/'' ./.
When/wrb I/ppss pressed/vbd for/in a/at purely/ql religious/jj definition/nn ,/, I/ppss encountered/vbd the/at familiar/jj blend/nn of/in liberal/jj piety/nn ,/, interfaith/jj good/jj will/nn ,/, and/cc a/at small/jj residue/nn of/in ethnic/jj loyalty/nn ./.


	``/`` I/ppss like/vb the/at tradition/nn ''/'' ,/, a/at girl/nn said/vbd ./.
``/`` I/ppss like/vb to/to follow/vb the/at holidays/nns when/wrb they/ppss come/vb along/rb ./.
But/cc you/ppss don't/do* have/hv to/to worship/vb in/in the/at traditional/jj way/nn ./.
You/ppss can/md communicate/vb in/in your/pp$ own/jj way/nn ./.
As/cs I/ppss see/vb it/ppo ,/, there's/ex+bez no/at real/jj difference/nn between/in being/beg Jewish/jj ,/, Catholic/jj ,/, or/cc Protestant/jj ''/'' ./.


	Another/dt teen-ager/nn remarked/vbd :/: ``/`` Most/ap Jews/nps don't/do* believe/vb in/in God/np ,/, but/cc they/ppss believe/vb in/in people/nns --/-- in/in helping/vbg people/nns ''/'' ./.

When/wrb asked/vbn how/wrb this/dt was/bedz different/jj from/in being/beg a/at good/jj Protestant/np ,/, the/at boy/nn answered/vbd ,/, ``/`` It's/pps+bez the/at same/ap thing/nn ''/'' ./.


	This/dt accords/vbz with/in the/at study/nn by/in Maier/np and/cc Spinrad/np ./.
They/ppss discovered/vbd that/cs ,/, although/cs 42/cd per/in cent/nn of/in a/at sample/nn of/in Catholic/jj students/nns and/cc 15/cd per/in cent/nn of/in the/at Protestants/nps believed/vbd it/ppo important/jj to/to live/vb in/in accordance/nn with/in the/at teachings/nns of/in their/pp$ religion/nn ,/, only/rb 8/cd per/in cent/nn of/in the/at Jewish/jj students/nns had/hvd this/dt conviction/nn ./.
The/at most/ql important/jj aims/nns of/in the/at Jewish/jj students/nns were/bed as/cs follows/vbz :/: to/to make/vb the/at world/nn a/at better/jjr place/nn to/to live/vb in/in --/-- 30/cd per/in cent/nn ;/. ;/.

	Nevertheless/rb ,/, most/ap of/in the/at teen-agers/nns I/ppss interviewed/vbd believed/vbd in/in maintaining/vbg their/pp$ Jewish/jj identity/nn and/cc even/rb envisioned/vbd joining/vbg a/at synagogue/nn or/cc temple/nn ./.
However/rb ,/, they/ppss were/bed hostile/jj to/in Jewish/jj-tl Orthodoxy/nn-tl ,/, professing/vbg to/to believe/vb in/in Judaism/np ``/`` but/cc in/in a/at moderate/jj way/nn ''/'' ./.
One/cd boy/nn said/vbd querulously/rb about/in Orthodox/jj-tl Jews/nps :/: ``/`` It's/pps+bez the/at twentieth/od century/nn ,/, and/cc they/ppss don't/do* have/hv to/to wear/vb beards/nns ''/'' ./.


	The/at reason/nn offered/vbn for/in clinging/vbg to/in the/at ancestral/jj faith/nn lacked/vbd force/nn and/cc authority/nn even/rb in/in the/at teen-agers'/nns$ minds/nns ./.
``/`` We/ppss were/bed brought/vbn up/rp that/dt way/nn ''/'' was/bedz one/cd statement/nn which/wdt won/vbd general/jj assent/nn ./.
``/`` I/ppss want/vb to/to show/vb respect/nn for/in my/pp$ parents'/nns$ religion/nn ''/'' was/bedz the/at way/nn in/in which/wdt a/at boy/nn justified/vbd his/pp$ inhabiting/vbg a/at halfway/jj house/nn of/in Judaism/np ./.
Still/rb another/dt suggested/vbd that/cs he/pps would/md join/vb a/at temple/nn ``/`` for/in social/jj reasons/nns ,/, since/cs I'll/ppss+md be/be living/vbg in/in a/at suburb/nn ''/'' ./.

Most/ap of/in the/at teen-agers/nns I/ppss interviewed/vbd rejected/vbn it/ppo on/in pragmatic/jj grounds/nns ./.
``/`` When/wrb you/ppss marry/vb ,/, you/ppss want/vb to/to have/hv things/nns in/in common/jj ''/'' ,/, a/at girl/nn said/vbd ,/, ``/`` and/cc it's/pps+bez hard/jj when/wrb you/ppss don't/do* marry/vb someone/pn with/in your/pp$ own/jj background/nn ''/'' ./.


	A/at fourteen-year-old/jj girl/nn from/in the/at Middle/jj-tl West/nr-tl observed/vbd wryly/rb that/cs ,/, in/in her/pp$ community/nn ,/, religion/nn inconveniently/rb interfered/vbd with/in religious/jj activities/nns --/-- at/in least/ap with/in the/at peripheral/jj activities/nns that/wps many/ap middle/jj class/nn Jews/nps now/rb regard/vb as/cs religious/jj ./.
It/pps appears/vbz that/cs an/at Orthodox/jj-tl girl/nn in/in the/at community/nn disrupted/vbd plans/nns for/in an/at outing/nn sponsored/vbn by/in one/cd of/in the/at Jewish/jj service/nn groups/nns because/cs she/pps would/md not/* travel/vb on/in Saturday/nr and/cc ,/, in/in addition/nn ,/, required/vbd kosher/jj food/nn ./.
Another/dt girl/nn from/in a/at relatively/ql large/jj midwestern/jj city/nn described/vbd herself/ppl as/cs ``/`` the/at only/ap Orthodox/jj-tl girl/nn in/in town/nn ''/'' ./.

The/at-hl older/jjr-hl teens/nns-hl 
One/cd of/in the/at significant/jj things/nns about/in Jewish/jj culture/nn in/in the/at older/jjr teen/nn years/nns is/bez that/cs it/pps is/bez largely/ql college-oriented/jj ./.
Sixty-five/cd per/in cent/nn of/in the/at Jewish/jj teen-agers/nns of/in college/nn age/nn attend/vb institutions/nns of/in higher/jjr learning/nn ./.
This/dt is/bez substantially/ql higher/jjr than/cs the/at figures/nns for/in the/at American/jj population/nn at/in large/jj --/-- 45.6/cd per/in cent/nn for/in males/nns and/cc 29.2/cd per/in cent/nn for/in females/nns ./.
This/dt may/md help/vb explain/vb a/at phenomenon/nn described/vbn by/in a/at small-town/nn Jewish/jj boy/nn ./.
In/in their/pp$ first/od two/cd years/nns in/in high/jj school/nn ,/, Jewish/jj boys/nns in/in this/dt town/nn make/vb strenuous/jj exertions/nns to/to win/vb positions/nns on/in the/at school/nn teams/nns ./.
However/rb ,/, in/in their/pp$ junior/jj and/cc senior/jj years/nns ,/, they/ppss generally/rb forego/vb their/pp$ athletic/jj pursuits/nns ,/, presumably/rb in/in the/at interest/nn of/in better/jjr academic/jj achievement/nn ./.
It/pps is/bez significant/jj ,/, too/rb ,/, that/cs the/at older/jjr teen-agers/nns I/ppss interviewed/vbd believed/vbd ,/, unlike/in the/at younger/jjr ones/nns ,/, that/cs Jewish/jj students/nns tend/vb to/to do/do better/rbr academically/rb than/cs their/pp$ gentile/jj counterparts/nns ./.


	The/at percentage/nn of/in Jewish/jj girls/nns who/wps attend/vb college/nn is/bez almost/ql as/ql high/jj as/cs that/dt of/in boys/nns ./.
The/at motivations/nns for/in both/abx sexes/nns ,/, to/to be/be sure/jj ,/, are/ber different/jj ./.
The/at vocational/jj motive/nn is/bez the/at dominant/jj one/cd for/in boys/nns ,/, while/cs Jewish/jj girls/nns attend/vb college/nn for/in social/jj reasons/nns and/cc to/to become/vb culturally/rb developed/vbn ./.
One/cd of/in the/at significant/jj developments/nns in/in American-Jewish/jj life/nn is/bez that/cs the/at cultural/jj consumers/nns are/ber largely/rb the/at women/nns ./.
It/pps is/bez they/ppss who/wps read/vb --/-- and/cc make/vb --/-- Jewish/jj best-sellers/nns and/cc then/rb persuade/vb their/pp$ husbands/nns to/to read/vb them/ppo ./.


	In/in upper/jj teen/nn Jewish/jj life/nn ,/, the/at non-college/nn group/nn tends/vbz to/to have/hv a/at sense/nn of/in marginality/nn ./.
``/`` People/nns automatically/rb assume/vb that/cs I'm/ppss+bem in/in college/nn ''/'' ,/, a/at nineteen-year-old/jj machinist/nn observed/vbd irritably/rb ./.
However/rb ,/, among/in the/at girls/nns ,/, there/ex are/ber some/dti morale-enhancing/jj compensations/nns for/in not/* going/vbg to/in college/nn ./.
The/at Jewish/jj working/vbg girl/nn almost/ql invariably/rb works/vbz in/in an/at office/nn --/-- in/in contradistinction/nn to/in gentile/jj factory/nn workers/nns --/-- and/cc ,/, buttressed/vbn by/in a/at respectable/jj income/nn ,/, she/pps is/bez likely/jj to/to dress/vb better/rbr and/cc live/vb more/ql expansively/rb than/cs the/at college/nn student/nn ./.

The/at-hl lower-middle/jj-hl class/nn-hl college/nn-hl student/nn-hl 
One/cd of/in the/at reasons/nns for/in the/at high/jj percentage/nn of/in Jewish/jj teen-agers/nns in/in college/nn is/bez that/cs a/at great/jj many/ap urban/jj Jews/nps are/ber enabled/vbn to/to attend/vb local/jj colleges/nns at/in modest/jj cost/nn ./.
This/dt is/bez particularly/ql true/jj in/in large/jj centers/nns of/in Jewish/jj population/nn like/cs New/jj-tl York/np-tl ,/, Chicago/np ,/, and/cc Philadelphia/np ./.


	What/wdt is/bez noteworthy/jj about/in this/dt large/jj group/nn of/in teen-agers/nns is/bez that/cs ,/, although/cs their/pp$ attitudes/nns hardly/rb differentiate/vb them/ppo from/in their/pp$ gentile/jj counterparts/nns ,/, they/ppss actually/rb lead/vb their/pp$ lives/nns in/in a/at vast/jj self-enclosed/jj Jewish/jj cosmos/nn with/in relatively/ql little/ap contact/nn with/in the/at non-Jewish/jj world/nn ./.


	Perhaps/rb the/at Jewish/jj students/nns at/in Brooklyn/np-tl College/nn-tl --/-- constituting/vbg 85/cd per/in cent/nn of/in those/dts who/wps attend/vb the/at day/nn session/nn --/-- can/md serve/vb as/cs a/at paradigm/nn of/in the/at urban/jj ,/, lower-middle/jj class/nn Jewish/jj student/nn ./.


	There/ex is/bez ,/, to/to begin/vb ,/, an/at important/jj sex/nn difference/nn ./.
Typically/rb ,/, in/in a/at lower-middle/jj class/nn Jewish/jj family/nn ,/, a/at son/nn will/md be/be sent/vbn to/in an/at out-of-town/jj school/nn ,/, if/cs financial/jj resources/nns warrant/vb it/ppo ,/, while/cs the/at daughter/nn will/md attend/vb the/at local/jj college/nn ./.
There/ex are/ber two/cd reasons/nns for/in this/dt ./.
First/od ,/, the/at girl's/nn$ education/nn has/hvz a/at lower/jjr priority/nn than/cs the/at son's/nn$ ./.
Second/od ,/, the/at attitude/nn in/in Jewish/jj families/nns is/bez far/ql more/rbr protective/jj toward/in the/at daughter/nn than/cs toward/in the/at son/nn ./.
Most/ap Jewish/jj mothers/nns are/ber determined/vbn to/to exercise/vb vigilance/nn over/in the/at social/jj and/cc sexual/jj lives/nns of/in their/pp$ daughters/nns by/in keeping/vbg them/ppo home/nr ./.
The/at consequence/nn of/in this/dt is/bez that/cs the/at girls/nns at/in Brooklyn/np-tl College/nn-tl outnumber/vb the/at boys/nns and/cc do/do somewhat/ql better/rbr academically/rb ./.
One/pn can/md assume/vb that/cs some/dti of/in the/at brightest/jjt boys/nns are/ber out/in of/in town/nn ./.


	Brooklyn/np-tl College/nn-tl students/nns have/hv an/at ambivalent/jj attitude/nn toward/in their/pp$ school/nn ./.
On/in the/at one/cd hand/nn ,/, there/ex is/bez a/at sense/nn of/in not/* having/hvg moved/vbn beyond/in the/at ambiance/nn of/in their/pp$ high/jj school/nn ./.
This/dt is/bez particularly/ql acute/jj for/in those/dts who/wps attended/vbd Midwood/np-tl High/jj-tl School/nn-tl directly/rb across/in the/at street/nn from/in Brooklyn/np-tl College/nn-tl ./.
They/ppss have/hv a/at sense/nn of/in marginality/nn at/in being/beg denied/vbn that/dt special/jj badge/nn of/in status/nn ,/, the/at out-of-town/jj school/nn ./.
At/in the/at same/ap time/nn ,/, there/ex is/bez a/at good/jj deal/nn of/in self-congratulation/nn at/in attending/vbg a/at good/jj college/nn --/-- they/ppss are/ber even/rb inclined/vbn to/to exaggerate/vb its/pp$ not/* inconsiderable/jj virtues/nns --/-- and/cc they/ppss express/vb pleasure/nn at/in the/at cozy/jj in-group/nn feeling/nn that/cs the/at college/nn generates/vbz ./.
``/`` It's/pps+bez people/nns of/in your/pp$ own/jj kind/nn ''/'' ,/, a/at girl/nn remarked/vbd ./.
``/`` You/ppss don't/do* have/hv to/to watch/vb what/wdt you/ppss say/vb ./.
Of/in course/nn ,/, I/ppss would/md like/vb to/to go/vb to/in an/at out-of-town/jj school/nn where/wrb there/ex are/ber all/abn kinds/nns of/in people/nns ,/, but/cc I/ppss would/md want/vb lots/nns of/in Jewish/jj kids/nns there/rb ''/'' ./.


	For/in most/ap Brooklyn/np-tl College/nn-tl students/nns ,/, college/nn is/bez at/in once/cs a/at perpetuation/nn of/in their/pp$ ethnic/jj attachments/nns and/cc a/at breaking/nn away/rb from/in the/at cage/nn of/in neighborhood/nn and/cc family/nn ./.
Brooklyn/np-tl College/nn-tl is/bez unequivocally/ql Jewish/jj in/in tone/nn ,/, and/cc efforts/nns to/to detribalize/vb the/at college/nn by/in bringing/vbg in/rp unimpeachably/ql midwestern/jj types/nns on/in the/at faculty/nn have/hv been/ben unavailing/jj ./.
However/rb ,/, a/at growing/vbg intellectual/jj sophistication/nn and/cc the/at new/jj certitudes/nns imparted/vbn by/in courses/nns in/in psychology/nn and/cc anthropology/nn make/vb the/at students/nns increasingly/ql critical/jj of/in their/pp$ somewhat/ql provincial/jj and/cc overprotective/jj parents/nns ./.
And/cc the/at rebellion/nn of/in these/dts third/od generation/nn Jews/nps is/bez not/* the/at traditional/jj conflict/nn of/in culture/nn but/cc ,/, rather/rb ,/, a/at protest/nn against/in a/at culture/nn that/cs they/ppss view/vb as/cs softly/ql and/cc insidiously/ql enveloping/vbg ./.
``/`` As/ql long/rb as/cs I'm/ppss+bem home/nr ,/, I'll/ppss+md never/rb grow/vb up/rp ''/'' ,/, a/at nineteen-year-old/jj boy/nn observed/vbd sadly/rb ./.

	For/in girls/nns ,/, the/at overprotection/nn is/bez far/ql more/ql pervasive/jj ./.
Parents/nns will/md drive/vb on/in Friday/nr night/nn to/to pick/vb up/rp their/pp$ daughters/nns after/in a/at sorority/nn or/cc House/nn-tl Plan/nn-tl meeting/nn ./.
A/at freshman/nn girl's/nn$ father/nn not/* too/ql long/rb ago/rb called/vbd a/at dean/nn at/in Brooklyn/np-tl College/nn-tl and/cc demanded/vbd the/at ``/`` low-down/nn ''/'' on/in a/at boy/nn who/wps was/bedz going/vbg out/rp with/in his/pp$ daughter/nn ./.
The/at domestic/jj tentacles/nns even/rb extend/vb to/in the/at choice/nn of/in a/at major/jj field/nn ./.
Under/in pressure/nn from/in parents/nns ,/, the/at majority/nn of/in Brooklyn/np-tl College/nn-tl girls/nns major/vb in/in education/nn since/cs that/dt co-ordinates/vbz best/rbt with/in marriage/nn plans/nns --/-- limited/vbn graduate/jj study/nn requirement/nn and/cc convenient/jj working/vbg hours/nns ./.

A/at kind/nn of/in double/jj standard/nn exists/vbz here/rb for/in Jewish/jj boys/nns and/cc girls/nns as/cs it/pps does/doz in/in the/at realm/nn of/in sex/nn ./.


	The/at breaking/nn away/rb from/in the/at prison/nn house/nn of/in Brooklyn/np is/bez gradual/jj ./.
