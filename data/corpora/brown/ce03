If/cs we/ppss could/md use/vb all/abn the/at small/jj airfields/nns we/ppss have/hv in/in this/dt country/nn ,/, we/ppss could/md disperse/vb our/pp$ strategic/jj aircraft/nn by/in a/at factor/nn of/in 10/cd or/cc more/ap ./.


	Use/vb nuclear/jj propulsions/nns to/to keep/vb our/pp$ long-range/nn military/jj aircraft/nn in/in the/at air/nn for/in the/at majority/nn of/in their/pp$ useful/jj life/nn ./.


	Using/vbg very/ql high/jj thrust-to-weight/jj ratio/nn engines/nns ,/, develop/vb a/at vertical-takeoff-and-landing/nn (/( VTOL/np )/) long-range/nn military/jj aircraft/nns ./.

We/ppss could/md put/vb a/at portion/nn of/in our/pp$ strategic/jj bombers/nns in/in such/jj shelters/nns ./.

There/ex is/bez little/ap enthusiasm/nn for/in spending/vbg money/nn to/to develop/vb more/ql powerful/jj engines/nns because/cs of/in the/at erroneous/jj belief/nn that/cs the/at aircraft/nn has/hvz been/ben made/vbn obsolete/jj by/in the/at missile/nn ./.


	This/dt same/ap preoccupation/nn with/in missiles/nns at/in the/at expense/nn of/in aircraft/nn has/hvz resulted/vbn in/in our/pp$ half-hearted/jj effort/nn to/to develop/vb nuclear/jj propulsion/nn for/in aircraft/nn ./.
