In/in any/dti event/nn ,/, the/at extraordinary/jj result/nn of/in this/dt injury/nn was/bedz that/cs he/pps became/vbd ``/`` psychically/rb blind/jj ''/'' ,/, while/cs at/in the/at same/ap time/nn ,/, apparently/rb ,/, the/at sense/nn of/in touch/nn remained/vbd essentially/rb intact/jj ./.
Psychical/jj blindness/nn is/bez a/at condition/nn in/in which/wdt there/ex is/bez a/at total/jj absence/nn of/in visual/jj memory-images/nns ,/, a/at condition/nn in/in which/wdt ,/, for/in example/nn ,/, one/pn is/bez unable/jj to/to remember/vb something/pn just/rb seen/vbn or/cc to/to conjure/vb up/rp a/at memory-picture/nn of/in the/at visible/jj appearance/nn of/in a/at well-known/jj friend/nn in/in his/pp$ absence/nn ./.

The/at necessary/jj inference/nn ,/, as/cs the/at authors/nns themselves/ppls interpret/vb it/ppo ,/, would/md seem/vb to/to be/be this/dt :/: ``/`` (/( (/( 1/cd )/) Spatial/jj qualities/nns are/ber not/* among/in those/dts grasped/vbn by/in the/at sense/nn of/in touch/nn ,/, as/cs such/jj ./.

	First/od of/in all/abn ,/, what/wdt is/bez their/pp$ evidence/nn that/cs the/at tactual/jj apparatus/nn was/bedz fundamentally/rb undamaged/jj ?/. ?/.
(/( 1/cd )/) When/wrb an/at object/nn was/bedz placed/vbn in/in the/at patient's/nn$ hand/nn ,/, he/pps had/hvd no/at difficulty/nn determining/vbg whether/cs it/pps was/bedz warm/jj or/cc cold/jj ,/, sharp/jj or/cc blunt/jj ,/, rough/jj or/cc smooth/jj ,/, flexible/jj ,/, soft/jj ,/, or/cc hard/jj ;/. ;/.

(/( 2/cd )/) The/at patient/nn attained/vbd an/at astonishing/jj efficiency/nn in/in a/at new/jj trade/nn ./.
Because/rb of/in his/pp$ brain/nn injury/nn and/cc the/at extreme/jj damage/nn suffered/vbn to/in his/pp$ sight/nn ,/, the/at patient/nn had/hvd to/to train/vb himself/ppl for/in a/at new/jj line/nn of/in work/nn ,/, that/dt of/in a/at portfolio-maker/nn ,/, an/at occupation/nn requiring/vbg a/at great/jj deal/nn of/in precision/nn in/in the/at making/nn of/in measurements/nns and/cc a/at fairly/ql well-developed/jj sense/nn of/in form/nn and/cc contour/nn ./.
It/pps seems/vbz clear/jj ,/, when/wrb one/pn takes/vbz into/in consideration/nn the/at exceedingly/ql defective/jj eyesight/nn of/in the/at patient/nn (/( we/ppss shall/md describe/vb it/ppo in/in detail/nn in/in connection/nn with/in our/pp$ second/od question/nn ,/, the/at one/cd concerning/in the/at psychical/jj blindness/nn of/in the/at patient/nn )/) ,/, that/cs he/pps had/hvd to/to rely/vb on/in his/pp$ sense/nn of/in touch/nn much/ql more/rbr than/cs the/at usual/jj portfolio-maker/nn and/cc that/cs consequently/rb that/dt faculty/nn was/bedz most/ql probably/rb more/ql sensitive/jj to/in shape/nn and/cc size/nn than/cs that/dt of/in a/at person/nn with/in normal/jj vision/nn ./.
And/cc so/rb the/at authors/nns conclude/vb :/: ``/`` The/at conduct/nn of/in the/at patient/nn in/in his/pp$ every-day/jj life/nn and/cc in/in his/pp$ work/nn ,/, even/rb more/ap than/cs the/at foregoing/vbg facts/nns (/( mentioned/vbn above/rb under/in 1/cd )/) ,/, leave/vb positively/rb no/at room/nn for/in doubt/nn that/cs the/at sense/nn of/in touch/nn ,/, in/in the/at ordinary/jj sense/nn of/in the/at word/nn ,/, was/bedz unaffected/jj ;/. ;/.

	If/cs the/at argument/nn is/bez accepted/vbn as/cs essentially/ql sound/jj up/rp to/in this/dt point/nn ,/, it/pps remains/vbz for/cs us/ppo to/to consider/vb whether/cs the/at patient's/nn$ difficulties/nns in/in orienting/vbg himself/ppl spatially/rb and/cc in/in locating/vbg objects/nns in/in space/nn with/in the/at sense/nn of/in touch/nn can/md be/be explained/vbn by/in his/pp$ defective/jj visual/jj condition/nn ./.

then/rb we/ppss shall/md perhaps/rb be/be in/in a/at position/nn to/to provide/vb something/pn like/cs a/at complete/jj answer/nn to/in the/at question/nn at/in hand/nn ./.


	In/in what/wdt ways/nns ,/, then/rb ,/, did/dod the/at patient's/nn$ psychical/jj blindness/nn manifest/vb itself/ppl ?/. ?/.
He/pps could/md not/* see/vb objects/nns as/cs unified/vbn ,/, self-contained/jj ,/, and/cc organized/vbn figures/nns ,/, as/cs a/at person/nn does/doz with/in normal/jj vision/nn ./.
The/at meaning/nn of/in this/dt ,/, as/cs we/ppss shall/md see/vb ,/, is/bez that/cs he/pps had/hvd no/at fund/nn of/in visual/jj memory-images/nns of/in objects/nns as/cs objects/nns ;/. ;/.
and/cc ,/, therefore/rb ,/, he/pps could/md not/* recognize/vb even/rb long-familiar/jj things/nns upon/in seeing/vbg them/ppo again/rb ./.
Instead/rb ,/, he/pps constantly/rb became/vbd lost/vbn in/in parts/nns and/cc components/nns of/in them/ppo ,/, confused/vbd some/dti of/in their/pp$ details/nns with/in those/dts of/in neighboring/vbg objects/nns ,/, and/cc so/rb on/rp ,/, unless/cs he/pps allowed/vbd time/nn to/to ``/`` trace/vb ''/'' the/at object/nn in/in question/nn through/in minute/jj movements/nns of/in the/at head/nn and/cc hands/nns and/cc in/in this/dt way/nn to/to discover/vb its/pp$ contours/nns ./.
According/in to/in his/pp$ own/jj testimony/nn ,/, he/pps never/rb actually/rb saw/vbd things/nns as/cs shaped/vbn but/cc only/rb as/cs generally/rb amorphous/jj ``/`` blots/nns ''/'' of/in color/nn of/in a/at more/ql or/cc less/ql indefinite/jj size/nn ;/. ;/.
at/in their/pp$ edges/nns they/ppss slipped/vbd pretty/ql much/rb out/rp of/in focus/nn altogether/rb ./.
But/cc by/in the/at tracing/vbg procedure/nn ,/, he/pps could/md ,/, in/in a/at strange/jj obviously/rb kinesthetic/jj manner/nn ,/, find/vb the/at unseen/jj form/nn ;/. ;/.
could/md piece/vb ,/, as/cs it/pps were/bed ,/, the/at jumbled/vbn mass/nn together/rb into/in an/at organized/vbn whole/nn and/cc then/rb recognize/vb it/ppo as/cs a/at man/nn or/cc a/at triangle/nn or/cc whatever/wdt it/pps turned/vbd out/rp to/to be/be ./.
If/cs ,/, however/rb ,/, the/at figure/nn to/to be/be discerned/vbn were/bed complicated/vbn ,/, composed/vbn of/in several/ap interlocking/vbg subfigures/nns ,/, and/cc so/rb on/rp ,/, even/rb the/at tracing/vbg process/nn failed/vbd him/ppo ,/, and/cc he/pps could/md not/* focus/vb even/rb relatively/ql simple/jj shapes/nns among/in its/pp$ parts/nns ./.
This/dt meant/vbd ,/, concretely/rb ,/, that/cs the/at patient/nn could/md not/* read/vb at/in all/abn without/in making/vbg writing-like/jj movements/nns of/in the/at head/nn or/cc body/nn ,/, became/vbd easily/rb confused/vbn by/in ``/`` hasher/nn marks/nns ''/'' inserted/vbn between/in hand-written/jj words/nns and/cc thus/rb confused/vbd the/at mark/nn for/in one/cd of/in the/at letters/nns ,/, and/cc could/md recognize/vb a/at simple/jj straight/jj line/nn or/cc a/at curved/vbn one/cd only/rb by/in tracing/vbg it/ppo ./.


	The/at patient/nn himself/ppl denied/vbd that/cs he/pps had/hvd any/dti visual/jj imagery/nn at/in all/abn ;/. ;/.
and/cc there/ex was/bedz ample/jj evidence/nn of/in the/at following/vbg sort/nn to/to corroborate/vb him/ppo ./.
After/in a/at conversation/nn with/in another/dt man/nn ,/, he/pps was/bedz able/jj to/to recount/vb practically/rb everything/pn that/wps had/hvd been/ben said/vbn but/cc could/md not/* describe/vb at/in all/abn what/wdt the/at other/ap man/nn looked/vbd like/cs ./.

In/in short/jj ,/, both/abx his/pp$ own/jj declarations/nns and/cc his/pp$ figural/jj blindness/nn ,/, when/wrb he/pps looked/vbd at/in objects/nns ,/, seem/vb to/to present/vb undeniable/jj evidence/nn that/cs he/pps had/hvd simply/rb no/at visual/jj memory/nn at/in all/abn ./.
He/pps was/bedz oblivious/jj of/in the/at form/nn of/in the/at object/nn actually/rb being/beg viewed/vbn ,/, precisely/rb because/cs he/pps could/md not/* assign/vb it/ppo to/in a/at visual/jj shape/nn ,/, already/rb learned/vbn and/cc held/vbn in/in visual/jj memory/nn ,/, as/cs persons/nns of/in normal/jj vision/nn do/do ./.
He/pps could/md not/* recognize/vb it/ppo ;/. ;/.
he/pps was/bedz absolutely/ql unfamiliar/jj with/in it/ppo because/cs he/pps had/hvd no/at visual/jj memory/nn at/in all/abn ./.
Therefore/rb ,/, his/pp$ only/ap recourse/nn was/bedz to/to learn/vb the/at shape/nn all/ql over/rp again/rb for/in each/dt new/jj visual/jj experience/nn of/in the/at same/ap individual/ap object/nn or/cc type/nn of/in object/nn ;/. ;/.
and/cc this/dt he/pps could/md do/do only/rb by/in going/vbg over/in its/pp$ mass/nn with/in the/at tracing/vbg procedure/nn ./.
Then/rb he/pps might/md finally/rb recognize/vb it/ppo ,/, apparently/rb by/in combining/vbg the/at visual/jj blot/nn ,/, actually/rb being/beg seen/vbn ,/, with/in tactual/jj feelings/nns in/in the/at head/nn or/cc body/nn accompanying/vbg the/at tracing/vbg movements/nns ./.
This/dt would/md mean/vb ,/, it/pps can/md readily/rb be/be seen/vbn ,/, that/cs ,/, again/rb ,/, for/in each/dt new/jj visual/jj experience/nn ,/, the/at tracing/vbg motions/nns would/md have/hv to/to be/be repeated/vbn because/rb of/in the/at absence/nn of/in visual/jj imagery/nn ./.


	As/cs one/pn would/md surmise/vb ,/, the/at procedure/nn ,/, however/rb ,/, could/md be/be repeated/vbn with/in the/at same/ap object/nn or/cc with/in the/at same/ap type/nn of/in object/nn often/rb enough/qlp ,/, so/cs that/cs the/at corresponding/jj visual/jj blots/nns and/cc the/at merest/jjt beginning/nn of/in the/at tracing/vbg movement/nn would/md provide/vb clues/nns as/in to/in the/at actual/jj shape/nn ,/, which/wdt the/at patient/nn then/rb immediately/rb could/md determine/vb by/in a/at kind/nn of/in inference/nn ./.
Men/nns ,/, trees/nns ,/, automobiles/nns ,/, houses/nns ,/, and/cc so/rb on/rp --/-- objects/nns continually/rb confronted/vbn in/in everyday/jj life/nn --/-- had/hvd each/dt its/pp$ characteristic/jj blot-appearance/nn and/cc became/vbd easily/rb recognizable/jj ,/, at/in the/at very/ap beginning/nn of/in tracing/vbg ,/, by/in an/at inference/nn as/in to/in what/wdt each/dt was/bedz ./.
Dice/nns ,/, for/in example/nn ,/, he/pps inferred/vbd from/in black/jj dots/nns on/in a/at white/jj surface/nn ./.
He/pps evidently/rb could/md not/* actually/rb see/vb the/at corners/nns of/in these/dts objects/nns ,/, but/cc their/pp$ size/nn and/cc the/at dots/nns gave/vbd them/ppo away/rb ./.
And/cc the/at authors/nns give/vb numerous/jj instances/nns of/in calculated/vbn guessing/vbg on/in the/at patient's/nn$ part/nn to/to show/vb how/wql large/jj a/at role/nn it/pps played/vbd in/in his/pp$ process/nn of/in readapting/vbg himself/ppl and/cc how/wql proficient/jj he/pps became/vbd at/in it/ppo ./.
Often/rb he/pps seems/vbz even/rb to/to have/hv been/ben able/jj to/to guess/vb correctly/rb ,/, without/in the/at tracing/vbg motions/nns ,/, solely/rb on/in the/at basis/nn of/in qualitative/jj differences/nns among/in the/at blot-like/jj things/nns which/wdt appeared/vbd in/in his/pp$ visual/jj experience/nn ./.


	Perhaps/rb the/at very/ql important/jj question/nn --/-- What/wdt is/bez ,/, then/rb ,/, exactly/rb the/at role/nn of/in kinesthetic/jj sensations/nns in/in the/at patient's/nn$ ability/nn to/to recognize/vb forms/nns and/cc shapes/nns by/in means/nn of/in the/at tracing/vbg movements/nns when/wrb he/pps is/bez actually/rb looking/vbg at/in things/nns ?/. ?/.
--/-- has/hvz now/rb been/ben raised/vbn in/in the/at reader's/nn$ mind/nn and/cc in/in the/at following/vbg form/nn ./.
If/cs the/at patient/nn can/md perceive/vb figure/nn kinesthetically/rb when/wrb he/pps cannot/md* perceive/vb it/ppo visually/rb ,/, then/rb ,/, it/pps would/md seem/vb ,/, the/at sense/nn of/in touch/nn has/hvz immediate/jj contact/nn with/in the/at spatial/jj aspects/nns of/in things/nns in/in independence/nn of/in visual/jj representations/nns ,/, at/in least/ap in/in regard/nn to/in two/cd dimensions/nns ,/, and/cc ,/, as/cs we/ppss shall/md see/vb ,/, even/rb this/dt much/ap spatial/jj awareness/nn on/in the/at part/nn of/in unaided/jj touch/nn is/bez denied/vbn by/in the/at authors/nns ./.
How/wrb ,/, then/rb ,/, do/do the/at kinesthetic/jj sensations/nns function/vb in/in all/abn this/dt ?/. ?/.
The/at authors/nns set/vbd about/rb answering/vbg this/dt fundamental/jj question/nn through/in a/at detailed/vbn investigation/nn of/in the/at patient's/nn$ ability/nn ,/, tactually/rb ,/, (/( 1/cd )/) to/to perceive/vb figure/nn and/cc (/( 2/cd )/) to/to locate/vb objects/nns in/in space/nn ,/, with/in his/pp$ eyes/nns closed/vbn (/( or/cc turned/vbn away/rb from/in the/at object/nn concerned/vbn )/) ./.
Quite/ql naturally/rb ,/, they/ppss make/vb the/at investigation/nn ,/, first/rb ,/, by/in prohibiting/vbg the/at patient/nn from/in making/vbg any/dti movements/nns at/in all/abn and/cc then/rb ,/, later/rbr ,/, by/in repeating/vbg it/ppo and/cc allowing/vbg the/at patient/nn to/to move/vb in/in any/dti way/nn he/pps wanted/vbd to/to ./.
