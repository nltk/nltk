<EMPH weight="bold">
Other medicines
</EMPH>
 <PB n=6> <CB n=1> <FIGURE></FIGURE> <CB n=2> Always tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines because taking some medicines together can be harmful.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
For example, you should not take Sporanox-Pulse if you are taking an antihistamine containing terfenadine or astemizole for hay fever or allergy. You should not take Sporanox-Pulse if you are taking cisapride (a drug used for certain digestive problems) or midazolam or triazolam (drugs used as sleeping pills). Your doctor will need to know if you are using the antibiotic rifampicin or antiepileptics such as phenytoin, as they may stop Sporanox-Pulse from working properly.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Your doctor may need to alter the dose of certain other medicines before you begin your course of Sporanox-Pulse. These include blood thinning agents, the heart drug digoxin and medicines known as cyclosporin A and tacrolimus which are usually given after an organ transplant. Special care is required if the tranquilliser midazolam is given intravenously during treatment with Sporanox-Pulse. Sporanox-Pulse can make the side effects of a medicine known as vincristine more severe and your doctor may need to change the dose of either or both of these medicines.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
There must be sufficient stomach acid to ensure that Sporanox-Pulse is properly absorbed by the body. Therefore, medicines that neutralise stomach acid such as medicines for indigestion, stomach ulcers or heartburn, should not be taken sooner than 2 hours after Sporanox-Pulse.
</BLOCK>

<HEAD weight="bold" >

<BLOCK>
Your doctor will tell you how many Sporanox-Pulse capsules to take and for how long you should continue to take them. Always read the label on your medicine and follow your doctor's instructions carefully. Ask your pharmacist if you are not sure about anything.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Your doctor will probably have recommended the following treatment course with Sporanox-Pulse.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
One pulse means 2 capsules of Sporanox-Pulse twice daily for 1 week. After this pulse you should stop taking Sporanox-Pulse for 3 weeks. Then the cycle is repeated, once for fingernail infections and twice for toenail infections. For toenail infections, wait 3 weeks after the second pulse before taking Sporanox-Pulse again.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
It is important that you carry on taking your medicine for as long as your doctor has told you to. Do not stop your treatment just because your condition appears to have improved.
