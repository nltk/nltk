 Macclesfield Cheshire United Kingdom 'Paludrine' is used to give some degree of protection (prophylaxis) against malaria in certain countries. Malaria prophylaxis is recommended for non-immune residents and travellers to malarious areas as these individuals have little or no immunity to malaria and risk severe attacks. It can also be prescribed by a doctor to help to suppress certain types of malaria.

IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Malaria can be fatal. It is essential to take medical advice on which antimalarial drugs are appropriate. For some countries 'Paludrine' may not be suitable or may have to be taken with another drug to give maximum protection.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
No medication can be guaranteed to protect against malaria in every case. Any traveller becoming ill either when visiting a malarious region or after returning home should suspect malaria and seek medical advice as soon as possible.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
In addition to taking antimalarial drugs it is advisable to take other measures. Protect against mosquito bites by wearing light-coloured long-sleeved clothing and long trousers, when out of doors after sunset. Use insect repellent creams on pans of the body not covered by clothing. Sleep in a properly screened room or under a mosquito net. Spray to kill any mosquitos that may have entered rooms in spite of screening.
