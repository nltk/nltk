Introduction
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
There are several means of preventing a pregnancy. One of these is by taking the pill. When taken correctly, the pill has several important advantages over other methods of contraception.

How Marvelon works
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
You take Marvelon once a day for 21 days on the run. This provides a small amount of female sex hormones. These hormones are intended to prevent the monthly release of an egg from the ovaries. If an egg is not released you cannot become pregnant. The first 21 days are followed by 7 days when you don-t take a pill. During these pill-free days your regular 'monthly period' occurs. However, this period may be lighter and shorter than usual.

How to take Marvelon
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
The Marvelon pack contains 21 white pills. On the day you start a new pack of Marvelon, take a pill marked with the corresponding day of the week. For example, if it is Wednesday, take the pill marked Wednesday on the upper row of the pack. Follow the direction of the arrows and continue taking one pill each day until the pack is empty - that is for 21 days in all. Take your pill at the same time each day, preferably in the evening. Swallow each pill whole, with water if necessary.
</BLOCK>

<DIV type=1>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
Your next packs
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
When you have finished all 21 pills, don-t take any more for 7 days. You will probably have a period during these 7 days. Start your next pack on the 8th day. Do this whether or not you are still bleeding or even if you have not had a period. Providing you take Marvelon correctly, you will always start each new pack on the same day of the week. You will not become pregnant during the 7 day break from taking the pill, as long as you have taken your pills correctly, and start the next Marvelon pack on time.
</BLOCK>

After a baby
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
If you have just had a baby and you are not breastfeeding, your doctor may advise you to start taking Marvelon 21 or 28 days after delivery. If so, you don't need any extra contraceptive precautions. Read the section 'How to take Marvelon', above.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you have had sex in the 21 to 28 days since the baby was born you must not start Marvelon until the first day of your first period.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you start Marvelon more than 28 days after delivery you will not be protected against pregnancy for the first 7 days of taking pills. For these 7 days, take extra contraceptive precautions. Read the section 'Extra contraceptive precautions', carefully.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you are breast feeding you can still become pregnant, and so you should take contraceptive precautions. Your doctor may advise you not to use the pill- it may reduce the amount of breast-milk you produce, especially if you start taking it shortly after delivery.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
You might be able to use the mini-pill (POP). Ask your doctor for advice.

After a miscarriage or abortion

What to do If your periods seem different at first

<BLOCK>
This is normal when you start the pill. You will probably have less bleeding and it may be a different shade of red. You may have a little bleeding from time to time while taking the pills but this should stop within a few months. If your periods seem different, don't stop taking your pills, just mention it to your doctor at your next visit.

If the symptoms disappear within 12 hours after you've taken a pill, take an extra pill from a spare pack and continue with the rest of the pack as usual Marvelon should still give you contraceptive protection during this cycle. However, if the symptoms continue after those 12 hours you must take extra contraceptive precautions during the stomach upset or diarrhoea and for the next 7 days. (Read the sections on the '7-day rule' and 'Extra contraceptive precautions carefully). If your stomach upset or diarrhoea continues for some time, consult your doctor.

Serious reactions
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Thrombosis (formation of blood clots in the blood vessels of the legs, lungs brain, heart or elsewhere). With the pill, and especially with earlier pills which contained higher quantities of oestrogen and progestogen, the risk of blood clots occurring in veins and arteries has been reported to be slightly greater than for women who don't use the pill.

Veins
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
In a very small number of women, clots broke away from the calf veins, and lodged in the arteries of the lungs causing 'pulmonary embolism'.

Arteries
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
It was reported that older women (35 40 years of age) who continued to smoke while taking the pill were more likely to suffer heart attacks and strokes. However, it has been shown that this is almost entirely due to the smoking habits of the women involved. You should stop smoking.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
You should go for regular careful blood pressure checks. if you yet high blood pressure stop using the pill.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
People don't always recover fully from a thrombosis and very occasionally they are fatal. Thrombosis has hardly ever been reported to occur in veins or arteries of the liver, the gut, the kidney or the eye.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
With modern low-dose pills there are reasons to believe that the events mentioned above may occur less often than with the earlier pills.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>

<EMPH weight="bold">
Other risk factors, apart from smoking, such as being greatly overweight, having fatty deposits in the arteries, high blood pressure diabetes, a major operation, long-term immobilisation and severe varicose veins may also increase the risk of contracting either thrombosis, heart attack or stroke.

<BLOCK>
Signs and symptoms of a blood Cot are given under the Warnings Section.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
On rare occasions, using the pill may lead to liver diseases such as jaundice and gall-stones, and very rarely it has been associated with certain liver tumours.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Oestrogen-dependent tumours.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Some studies have shown an increased risk of cervical and/or breast cancer on long term use of the combined contraceptive pill, however, this evidence is not conclusive. This possible risk, though small, may be expected to be less with low dose pills.
