TAKING YOUR MEDICINE
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Follow the instructions given to you by your doctor. He/She will tell you how many VISKEN tablets to take and how often you should take them. If you are not sure, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The dose of VISKEN varies depending on the illness for which you are being treated. For hypertension (high blood pressure), patients usually start treatment with either 15mg VISKEN taken once daily with breakfast, or 5mg VISKEN taken two or three times a day. The dose may then be increased to one that is ideal for you. Most patients respond to 15 to 30mg VISKEN per day, but some patients need higher doses than this to control their blood pressure.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
For angina, the usual dose is half to one 5mg VISKEN tablet, taken up to three times per day.
