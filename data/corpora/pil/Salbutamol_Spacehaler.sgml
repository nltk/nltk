How your medicine works
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Salbutamol is one of a group of medicines known as beta-agonists.  These work by opening up the bronchioles (the airways in the lungs) and this helps to relieve asthma attacks.  This type of medicine is known as a ‘RELIEVER’, as it is used to provide relief during asthma attacks or when you feel wheezy.  If you are needing to use your reliever more than your doctor has recommended, tell your doctor.  You may need to be given another type of treatment as well as your reliever.

Important
</EMPH>
 Do not rush steps 3 and 4.  It is important that you start to breathe in as slowly as possible just before operating your inhaler.  Practice in the mirror for the first few times.  If you see a mist coming from the top of the inhaler or the sides of your mouth you should start again from step 2.
</BLOCK>

<PB n=6>

<BLOCK>
Do not stop taking your medicine unless advised to do so by your doctor.  Since Salbutamol Spacehaler helps to prevent as well as relieve asthmatic attacks, it is important to keep taking your inhaler even when you have no symptoms.  Always have your inhaler with you in case of an asthma attack.  School children must be able to use this inhaler, if required, at school.
