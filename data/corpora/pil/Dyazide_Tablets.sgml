YOUR MEDICINE IS 'DYAZIDE'
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>

<EMPH weight="bold">
What is 'Dyazide'?
</EMPH>
 'Dyazide' is the maker's name for this medicine for the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension (high blood pressure) and/or oedema (fluid retention). The active ingredients in 'Dyazide' are triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>

<EMPH weight="bold">
What does 'Dyazide' do?
</EMPH>
 The two active ingredients in 'Dyazide' are diuretics. They act on the kidneys to remove more water from the body and thereby increase the volume of urine. 'Dyazide' therefore reduces blood pressure by reducing the volume of blood and the work required by the heart. It also removes excess water from the tissues to relieve any oedema (e.g. swollen ankles).
