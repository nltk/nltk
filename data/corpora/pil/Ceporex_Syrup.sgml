What your medicine does

<BLOCK>
Ceporex syrup contains cephalexin which is one of a group of medicines called antibiotics.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Antibiotics are used to kill the bacteria or "germs" which cause infections. Your doctor has prescribed this medicine because he has found that you have an infection. This can be cleared up if you take this medicine in the proper way.

Use the 5ml spoon that the pharmacist has given you to measure the amount of medicine to take.

It is best to take the syrup as it is. If you want you can add a little water to each dose just before you take it. Do not add water or other drinks to the bottle, that may stop it working properly.
