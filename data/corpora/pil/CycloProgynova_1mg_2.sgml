How to take Cyclo-Progynova 1 mg
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
About the pack:
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The pack of Cyclo-Progynova 1 mg is designed to help you remember to take your medicine. To use it you must first know the day of the week on which you will take the first tablet. If you are still having periods, take the first tablet on the fifth day of your period, whether the period has finished or not. If your periods have become infrequent or have stopped altogether, your doctor may have advised you to start Cyclo-Progynova 1 mg immediately. In addition to the memo-pack (which contains the tablets), the outer carton contains a self--adhesive blue sticker showing the days of the week. Peel the circular sticker off its backing and stick it in the centre of the memo-pack so that the day on which you start taking the tablets is directly underneath the red segment marked &quot;Start&quot;.

For instance, it you are to start the tablets on a
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Wednesday, then stick a &quot;Wed&quot; directly underneath the red segment marked &quot;Start&quot;". You can now see on which day you have to take each tablet. Simply take one tablet each day, following the directions of the arrows, until the pack is empty. This means that you will be taking one beige tablet for the first 11 days and then one pale brown tablet daily for the following 10 days. If, at any time, you are in doubt whether you have taken your tablet, a glance at the appropriate day on the memo-pack will tell you.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
When you have finished your first pack, you must leave a tablet-tree interval of seven days (unless your doctor decides otherwise). During this week, bleeding similar to a period should occur.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Start your next pack of Cyclo-Progynova 1 mg immediately after this seven-day break, whether the bleeding has stopped or not. You will in fact start on the same day as you started the previous pack, and the same will be true for each successive pack.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
It is best to take your tablet at the same time each day, preferably after a meal. The tablet should not be chewed or sucked, but swallowed whole.

Just as with normal periods, the amount of bleeding with Cyclo-Progynova 1 mg varies from woman to woman. Usually the bleeding is not unduly heavy, and it may even be rather scanty, but this is not important as tar as the treatment is concerned. It you have recently had very light, short periods, you may have rather heavier bleedings with Cyclo-Progynova 1 mg.
