Why have I been given Nivaquine Tablets?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
NIVAQUINE is usually given to help prevent you getting malaria. Malaria is spread by mosquitos.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Some mosquitos carry the malaria parasites and can infect you with them if they bite you - it can take a week or more to develop malaria after an infected bite.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
NIVAQVINE can help prevent you getting malaria when you have been bitten by a mosquito.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Like other similar medicines, in some cases NIVAQUINE will not give complete protection against malaria. It is, therefore, important you follow all other medical advice.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Make sure that you have told your doctor or pharmacist which countries you are visiting. In some parts of the world the malaria parasites are not affected by chloroquine.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you have been given another anti-malarial medicine to take with NIVAQUINE, then you must follow the separate directions for it.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Sometimes your doctor may have prescribed NIVAQUINE for treating other conditions. Please contact your doctor if this is the case.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you are already taking NIVAQUINE or medicines called &quot;Avloclor" or &quot;PIaquenil" for another condition consult your doctor.
</BLOCK>
