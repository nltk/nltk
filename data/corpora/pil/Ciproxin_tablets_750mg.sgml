What do my tablets contain?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Each tablet contains 750mg of the active ingredient ciprofloxacin.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Ciproxin tablets 750mg also contain maize starch, microcrystalline cellulose, crospovidone, colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose 2910, polyethylene glycol 4000 and the colouring agent titanium dioxide
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The tablets come in packs of 10, 20 and 100, but your doctor will prescribe as many as you need.  However, your doctor may give you a starter pack containing two Ciproxin tablets to start your course of treatment.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The ciprofloxacin contained in Ciproxin is one of a group of antibiotics called quinolones which work by killing bacteria that cause infections.

Why have I been prescribed Ciproxin tablets by my doctor?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Ciproxin tablets have been prescribed by your doctor to treat your bacterial infection.  Some of the infections which Ciproxin can be used to treat are:
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Chest infections, e.g. bronchitis.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Infections of the urinary tract, e.g. cystitis.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Intestinal infections, e.g. infective diarrhoea.
</BLOCK>

When should I not take Ciproxin tablets?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Do not take Ciproxin tablets if you have previously had an allergic reaction to the active ingredient ciprofloxacin or any other quinolone antibiotics. If you are unsure about this, ask your doctor.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Generally, Ciproxin should not be given to children and adolescents unless considered essential by a doctor.  As with other antibiotics in this group, Ciproxin may cause pain and swelling in the developing joints of these patients.
</BLOCK>

<HEAD slant="italic"  weight="bold" >
What special precautions should I take?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
If you are pregnant, planning a family or breast-feeding, tell your doctor before taking Ciproxin as it is not recommended for use under these conditions.  If you have already informed your doctor, follow his/her instructions carefully.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Providing you do not have a problem with your heart or kidneys, you should drink plenty of liquid whilst taking Ciproxin. Ciproxin may cause a problem with your kidneys called &quot;crystalluria&quot; which results in tiny crystals forming in the urine.  These crystals cannot be seen by the naked eye.  Drinking plenty of liquid can help prevent this occurring.  However, if you experience pain or discomfort when passing urine whilst you are taking Ciproxin, tell your doctor.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you have a problem with your kidneys, tell your doctor before taking Ciproxin.  Your doctor may wish to change your dose to allow for any reduced kidney function.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you have previously had &quot;fits&quot; or suffer from epilepsy or if you have ever suffered other conditions related to the nervous supply to the brain, tell your doctor before taking Ciproxin tablets.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Ciproxin may make you feel less alert, particularly when taken with alcohol.  Therefore, make sure you know how you react to Ciproxin before you drive or operate machinery. If in doubt, consult your doctor.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you have a family history of or know that you have the hereditary condition G6PD, deficiency remind your doctor before taking Ciproxin.  This condition causes a deficiency of certain chemicals in the red blood cells and, if Ciproxin is taken, it may lead to the breaking down of red blood cells resulting in anaemia and yellowing of the skin (jaundice).
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Ciproxin may occasionally cause pain and inflammation around your tendons particularly if you are elderly or taking one of a group of medicines called steroids such as hydrocortisone.  If you experience these symptoms, seek medical advice immediately and rest the affected limb.  Do not take the next dose of Ciproxin tablets unless your doctor tells you to.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Certain medicines are known to affect the action of Ciproxin and are best avoided whilst taking it.  Therefore, ask your doctor for advice if you wish to take antacids for indigestion or any other preparations containing aluminum, calcium, magnesium or iron whilst taking Ciproxin.  If these preparations are essential, they must not be taken within four hours of taking Ciproxin tablets.  If you take multivitamins or minerals, check that they do not contain iron, calcium or magnesium. If they do, your doctor may want you to stop taking them whilst you are taking Ciproxin.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Remind your doctor if you are taking drugs that thin the blood (anticoagulants) such as warfarin, or any medicines used to relieve pain and inflammation (e.g. fenbufen) except for aspirin.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you are taking glibenclamide for diabetes, remind your doctor as Ciproxin sometimes increases the ability of glibenclamide to lower blood sugar and may result in hypoglycaemia (ie a &quot;hypo&quot;).
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Remind your doctor if you are taking probenecid or metoclopramide as these drugs may affect the level of Ciproxin in your blood.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you are taking cyclosporin at the same time as Ciproxin, your doctor may want to take regular blood samples to monitor the level of a substance called creatinine in your blood.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you take theophylline for asthma, remind your doctor as he/she may want to monitor the level of theophylline in your blood. This is particularly important if you suffer from &quot;fits&quot; or convulsions.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>

<EMPH weight="bold">
If you go into hospital for surgery, have dental treatment which requires an anaesthetic or you need to provide a blood or urine sample, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking Ciproxin tablets.

When and how do I take Ciproxin tablets?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
The dosage of Ciproxin required and the duration of treatment depends upon the severity and type of your infection.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Take the tablets as prescribed by your doctor.  Usually this will be one tablet taken twice daily. The tablet(s) should be swallowed whole with a glass of water.  Drink several more glasses of water during every day of your treatment, unless told otherwise by your doctor.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Take the tablets for as long as directed by your doctor.  The usual duration of treatment is between 3 and 10 days, but it may be longer if your infection is more persistent or severe.  It is important that you complete the course of treatment, even if you begin to feel better after a few days.  If you stop taking this medicine too soon, your symptoms may return

What side-effects may I experience?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
As can happen with some antibiotics, certain side-effects have been reported after Ciproxin.  You may experience diarrhoea, feeling sick (nausea), vomiting, indigestion, stomach-ache, wind, difficulty in swallowing, loss of appetite, headache, restlessness, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, skin rashes and itching.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Rarely, a disorder called pseudomembranous colitis can occur which causes attacks of diarrhoea containing blood and mucus.  Consult your doctor immediately if this occurs.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you experience &quot;fits", trembling, hallucinations, very severe headaches with visual disturbances, increased sleepiness, sleep disorders or feel anxious, confused or depressed, consult your doctor as soon as possible.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Rarely, people have experienced visual disturbances, impaired sense of taste and smell, ringing in the ears and, sometimes, impaired hearing which returns to normal once treatment with Ciproxin finishes.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Ciproxin may cause joint or tendon swelling with pain which may lead to tendon rupture.  If you experience these symptoms, seek medical advice immediately and rest the affected limb.  Do not take the next dose of Ciproxin tablets unless your doctor tells you to.  Ciproxin can also cause muscle pain.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
As with all medicines, some people may be allergic to Ciproxin.  Usually, if you are allergic to Ciproxin, a reaction will occur soon after you start taking the tablets.  An allergic reaction can appear as a rash, hives, itching, small red spots on the skin or a fever.  Very rarely, an allergy to Ciproxin can cause swelling of the blood vessels in the skin and severe skin reactions such as large fluid-filled blisters, sores and ulceration.  Ulceration can also occur in the mouth and throat, around the anus and genital region and on the surface of the eyes.  These symptoms are often accompanied by sickness, headache and fever.  
<EMPH weight="bold">
If you experience any of these symptoms, stop the treatment and seek medical advice immediately

.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The skin of some people may become more sensitive to the sun whilst taking Ciproxin.  Avoid too much sun and do not use a sun lamp until you know how you react when taking Ciproxin.  If in doubt, consult your doctor.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Ciproxin has been known to cause effects on the liver such as inflammation (hepatitis) and yellow jaundice.  It may also cause effects on the kidney which lead to pain and discomfort when passing water (crystalluria).  If you notice yellowing of your skin or any change in your urine output or appearance, possibly accompanied by kidney pain, seek medical advice immediately.  Ciproxin may affect certain components in the blood.  This may lead to bruising, jaundice, a persistent sore throat, fever with tiredness or a general feeling of being unwell.
</BLOCK>

<EMPH weight="bold">
IF YOU EXPERIENCE ANY OF THESE EFFECTS OR ANY OTHER UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS, TELL YOUR DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY.  YOUR DOCTOR WILL GIVE YOU ADVICE.
