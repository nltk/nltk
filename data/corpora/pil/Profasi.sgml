Important information you should know about Profasi
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Profasi may cause pain and soreness at the injection site.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>

<EMPH slant = "italic">
Women:
</EMPH>
 Occasionally, some people have a reaction to the treatment that you have been given/are taking and develop a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation. This is when the ovaries overreact to the treatment. This condition can cause various symptoms to occur. The most common is abdominal (stomach) pain. Rarely, the condition can be severe and you may need to be in hospital. To stop this ! condition developing or reduce the chances of it happening, it is important that it is your doctor who ! decides whether or not you should take the Profasi. h is, therefore, recommended that you see your doctor shortly before you are due to start the treatment with Profasi, so that he can check your ovarian response. It is important that if you have significant abdominal (stomach) pain or discomfort, you must NOT give yourself the injection of Profasi and that you speak to your doctor or nurse as soon as possible. The doctor will then decide whether or not to continue the treatment cycle. If you have to stop treatment, you S will be asked not to have sexual intercourse and usually you will have to rest.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Sometimes, multiple pregnancies occur following treatment. The majority of these are twins. It is very rare to have a large number of babies at the same time due to the treatment with Profasi.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Pregnancy loss (miscarriage) in women undergoing assisted conception techniques is higher than normal but much the same as rates found in women with other fertility problems.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The risk of the baby having any abnormalities is not ! increased by taking Profasi.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
This medicine should not be used by girls or the elderly.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>

<EMPH slant = "italic">
Men/boys:
</EMPH>
 In men, high doses of Profasi could lead to a condition called oedema. This is when the body retains water. The most usual signs are swollen feet and hands. If this occurs, the amount of Profasi that you are given will probably be reduced.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
In men or boys, the medicine may bring about puberty-like symptoms. If this happens at an early age, the treatment will probably be stopped.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
How will Profasi be given to you?
</HEAD>
