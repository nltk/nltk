Are you taking any other medicines?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
It is important to mention to your doctor and pharmacist all the medicines you are taking, including those bought without a prescription. This is important because some medicines may be affected by Surgam. These medicines include those used to stop your blood clotting, medicines used to treat diabetes, water tablets (diuretics), phenytoin or lithium. Your doctor knows about these, and will alter your treatment if it is considered necessary

<HEAD weight="bold"  uline="plain" >
How should you take your medicine ?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Always take the number of tablets your doctor has asked you to take. Usually this will be one tablet three times a day Some patients, especially the elderly, may be more likely to suffer side effects whilst taking Surgam tablets. In such cases, the doctor may reduce the number of tablets to be taken. Your doctor's directions should be written on the dispensing label on the box. If you are not sure, your pharmacist will be able to help you. You should not take more than your doctor has prescribed.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
You should take the tablets after meals with a glass of water or a milky drink. Take the tablets for as long as your doctor has asked - some conditions require longer periods of treatments than others.

What about side effects ?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Like all medicines, Surgam may cause you some problems. Some patients find that they suffer from indigestion or heartburn, stomach pain, feeling sick, vomiting, diarrhoea or constipation, flatulence (wind), anorexia (decreased appetite), inflammation (swelling) in the mouth, headache or drowsiness. These side effects may go away during treatment as your body adjusts to the medicine. If any of the symptoms continue or are troublesome contact your doctor or pharmacist.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Very rarely, there may be more serious effects - you may have a stomach ulcer and could experience coughing or vomiting up blood, severe stomach pains or pass dark, tarry faeces (stools). You may develop itching, wheezing, or swelling of the lips or eyes. If any of these serious effects occur, stop taking the tablets straight away and contact your doctor immediately.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Urinary problems may occur such as pain on passing water or increased frequency of passing water and, very rarely, blood in the urine. In extreme cases you may experience kidney toxicity, characterised by fluid retention, possibly accompanied by fatigue and a feeling of being unwell. 
<EMPH weight="bold">
