How to use your medicine
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Trosyl Nail Solution is for external use only.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Apply the nail solution 
<EMPH weight="bold">
thinly
</EMPH>
 to cover the whole of the affected nail(s) and surrounding skin using the brush provided. Apply the solution every 12 hours.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Leave the solution to dry for 10-15 minutes after application.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The solution does not dry hard. A transparent, slightly greasy film is left on the nail. This film contains the antifungal agent and it slowly passes through the nail to reach the site of infection.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The film should be left intact as long as possible. This allows the antifungal agent to have maximum effect.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Try to avoid putting your hands (or feet if your toenails are affected) in soapy water immediately after applying the solution. Soap or detergent removes the film.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Water alone does not remove the film.
