Q.What is this medicine for?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
A.Ecostatin Pessaries are for the treatment of vaginal thrush (vulvovaginal candidosis). Vaginal thrush is a common infection and is caused by a yeast (fungus) called Candida infecting the vulva and vagina. This medicine works by killing the fungus that has caused your symptoms such as any itching, soreness, redness, pain or white, non-smelly discharge.

Q.Should I continue to have sex?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
A.It is not a good idea to have sex while you have a thrush infection as it is easily transmitted to your sexual partner who might in turn give it back to you. Also, Ecostatin can damage the rubber of contraceptive diaphragms and condoms (sheaths) so that they are no longer safe to use.
