HOW YOUR NASAL SPRAY WORKS
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
If you suffer from hayfever the inside of your nose becomes swollen and itchy This often occurs during the early summer when it is caused by breathing in pollens from grasses or trees Some people get problems all the year round, often due to house dust or tiny pieces of hair from a dog or cat. Flixonase Aqueous Nasal Spray contains a steroid called fluticasone propionate. When you spray it into your nose in tiny amounts, it reduces the swelling and irritation and so helps to relieve sneezing and watering and reduce the itchy and blocked up feelings which make you feel uncomfortable.
