What medical checks will you have?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Most people receiving Innohep do not have regular tests to check levels of tinzaparin sodium in their blood since it is not necessary to monitor this treatment.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you have blood tests for other reasons, tell your doctor or nurse that you are receiving Innohep. It could affect the results. Do not miss appointments with your doctor.

Innohep is usually administered by a health Care professional by injection under the skin. It is usually given once a day for at least 6 days depending on your own response to the medicine. The dose given will depend upon your weight.

Does Innohep have side effects?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Innohep can sometimes have side effects but these are rare.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
These include: skin rashes, bruising at the injection site and allergic reactions such as hot flushes, difficulty in breathing skin itching and redness. The most serious is blood in your urine or bowel motions or bleeding from your nose which is due to a decrease of cells in your blood. Like other agents which stop the blood from clotting, it also increases the incidence of bleeding. Frequently there is an increase in an enzyme level in your blood (transaminase) but this does not usually mean that you have to stop your treatment.
