</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
The action of ORGAFOL is similar to that of the natural hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).

Close supervision
</EMPH>
 of female patients is extremely important. Usually blood sampling and ultrasound are performed daily. The results of these tests allow the doctor to choose the proper dose from day to day. This is very important since too high a dose may lead to overstimulation of the ovaries. This may be noticed as pain in the abdomen. Should you be troubled with pain in the abdomen, contact your doctor without delay.

Using this medicine properly
</EMPH>
 ORGAFOL should only be given by a doctor or nurse How much
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The dose is chosen by the doctor.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
In female patients the dose is usually 75 or 150 units per day to start with, however the dose may vary according to the response. Injections are given daily or sometimes every second day for about 10 days.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
In male patients injections of 75 units are given several times a week for at least 10-12 weeks.

MORE ABOUT ORGAFOL
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
The action of ORGAFOL is similar to that of the natural hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). In both men and women this hormone is produced in the pituitary gland. Together FSH and another hormone, luteinizing hormone (LH) control the action of the sexual glands (ovaries in women and testes in men).
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
In women FSH ensures the monthly ripening of the follicle, a tiny cavity in which the egg cell develops. LH is needed for ovulation, the release of the egg cell. If the body itself does not produce enough FSH and LH, infertility may be the result. In these cases ORGAFOL can be used to make up the shortage. To determine the right dosage a daily check is necessary. The amount of oestrogens (female hormones) in blood or urine is measured and the follicle size is determined by means of ultrasound. When the follicle is big enough, another hormone (for instance Pregnyl) is given. This is a strong LH preparation which causes ovulation. In spite of the careful monitoring more than one egg cell may be released. This increases the chance of twins or multiplets.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
In men very high LH activity is necessary for the production of sperm cells. Therefore, extra Pregnyl injections are given as well as ORGAFOL. Because the development of sperm cells takes about 74 days, treatment should be continued for at least 10 to 12 weeks before any improvement can be expected.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Infertility can also be the result of causes other than a shortage of FSH and LH. In these cases artificial techniques are sometimes used, for instance test-tube fertilization (in-vitro fertilization). For this technique several egg cells are needed and ORGAFOL is used to cause a number of egg cells to develop.
