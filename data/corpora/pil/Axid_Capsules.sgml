Why Axid?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Axid treats ulcers at the top of the small intestine ('duodenal ulcers') and protects the intestines once they are healed. It is also used to treat and protect your stomach against ulcers that are not cancerous. Axid also treats a type of heartburn called 'reflux oesophagitis'. This is an irritation of your oesophagus, the tube that takes food and liquids into your stomach.
