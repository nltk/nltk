Introduction
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Your doctor has chosen this medicine as a suitable treatment for your skin. This booklet explains how it works.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Although it is used for treating the skin, it is also an effective contraceptive. This means that when prescribing this medicine, your doctor has to deal with all the things that would apply to an ordinary oral contraceptive. While you are taking this medicine, you should not take any other oral contraceptive pill.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>
<DIV type=1>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
Your skin and androgens
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
You may be surprised to know that your body makes male sex hormones (androgens) as well as the female sex hormones (oestrogens). Your ovaries have to make androgens so that they can be changed into oestrogens.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Androgens stimulate the growth of the skin, including the grease-glands and the hairs that grow from it. They also cause the grease-glands to make large amounts of 'sebum', the oily substance that gives you greasy skin . If your body produces too much androgen or if your skin is particularly sensitive to the effects of androgens, the grease-glands may produce too much sebum. This can lead to blockage of the grease-glands which can then become infected and inflamed causing acne spots.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Androgens may also cause more growth of hair on the face and body.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>
<DIV type=1>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
How Dianette works
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Every hormone is made in a part of the body, but acts somewhere else. This is because, until it becomes attached - like a key in a lock - to its own receptors in the tissues where it is meant to work, the hormone cannot act at all. The special hormone in this medicine, cyproterone acetate, attaches itself to androgen receptors in the skin, (but does not 'unlock' them), and it blocks the receptors (like the wrong key jammed in a lock) so that the androgens cannot affect the skin. This is its main action.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Your medicine also reduces the activity of the ovaries, so that much smaller amounts of hormones including androgens, are produced.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
Contraception with Dianette- The contraceptive properties of Dianette
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
As with ordinary oral contraceptives, Dianette prevents the release of eggs (ova). It also makes the mucus in the neck of the womb thick, so that sperm cannot get through, and makes the lining of the womb unsuitable for an egg to grow on.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
It prevents pregnancy as well as any ordinary combined contraceptive pill, which is one of the most effective methods of contraception. Therefore you do not need to use another contraceptive method to prevent pregnancy while taking this medicine, except as described under "What to do if you forget to take a pill and are relying on Dianette for contraceptive cover", "Stomach upsets" and "Taking other medicines with Dianette".

Sunbeds/sun-ray lamps (ultraviolet)
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Ultraviolet lamps are used by some women for acne as well as to tan the skin. This is not a very useful treatment for acne. Ultraviolet lamps and prolonged sunbathing should be avoided if you are taking Dianette as their use increases the chance of chloasma, a patchy discoloration of the skin (as it does with ordinary contraceptives).
</BLOCK>


</DIV>
<DIV type=1>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
Taking other medicines with Dianette
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Some medicines may stop Dianette working properly as a contraceptive. If you are taking any other medicine while you are relying on Dianette for contraception, be sure to tell your doctor (or dentist). Your doctor (or dentist) can tell you whether you should use extra contraceptive precautions and for how long.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Medicines which can sometimes stop Dianette from working properly are antibiotics (such as ampicillin and rifampicin), griseofulvin (which is used to treat fungal infections)- phenylbutazone (which is used as an anti-inflammatory drug to treat some types of joint diseases); phenytoin, primidone, phenobarbitone and some other medicines used in people with epilepsy, and carbamazepine (which can be used to treat epilepsy or other illnesses).
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you are relying on Dianette for contraception and you are taking any of these medicines you will also need to use an extra contraceptive method (condoms or cap plus spermicide) while you are taking the other medicine and for 7 days after you stop taking it. If your present pack ends before those 7 days, start the next pack the next day without a break. If you run two packs together you may not have a period until the end of two packs, but this is not harmful. If you do not have a period after the second pack, you must talk to your doctor before you start the next pack.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If your doctor prescribes oral antibiotics as well as this medicine for the treatment of your acne, you must make it clear to your doctor if you want to rely on this method for contraception. Medicines applied to the skin, including antibiotics, will not affect the contraceptive reliability of Dianette.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you are taking rifampicin, and you are relying on this medicine for contraception, you will need to use another method of contraception as well as Dianette. You should do this while you are taking the rifampicin and for 4 weeks after you stop.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you are diabetic your doctor may after the dose of medicine required to treat your diabetes.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you are in doubt, check with your doctor or pharmacist.

<HEAD weight="bold" >
Stomach upsets
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Being sick or having very bad diarrhoea may stop this medicine from working properly. If this happens and you are relying on this method for contraception carry on taking it as usual, and also use another method of contraception (condoms or cap plusspermicide), until 7 days after you have recovered from the stomach upset. If you finish your pack before these 7 days, start the next pack the next day without a break. If you run two packs together you may not have a period until the end of two packs, but this is not harmful. If you do not have a period after the second pack, you must talk to your doctor before starting the next pack. If your stomach upset continues for some time, consult your doctor who may consider another form of contraception.

Warnings
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>

<EMPH slant = "italic">
Pregnancy:
</EMPH>
 Androgens (male sex hormones) are necessary for the development of the sexual organs in males, and the strong action of cyproterone acetate (contained in Dianette) against androgens has been found to prevent the normal development of these organs during pregnancy in experimental animals. The degree of risk in humans of such an effect (known as feminisation ) is uncertain and for this reason it is absolutely essential that you should not be pregnant while taking Dianette. If you think you might be pregnant, stop taking Dianette and consult your doctor immediately. Use another method of contraception such as a condom until you see your doctor.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Apart from its strong action against androgens, Dianette has many properties in common with combined pills (combinations of two hormones), which must not be taken during treatment with Dianette. Although the following statements refer to combined oral contraceptives, they should, for practical purposes be taken to apply to Dianette also.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
It has been suggested, on the basis of statistical evidence, that the risk of developing various disorders of the circulation of the blood is slightly greater in women who take the combined pill than in those who do not. This can lead to, for example, deep vein thrombosis (blood clot in the leg), strokes (blood clots and haemorrhages from the blood vessels of the brain), heart attacks or pulmonary embolism (blood clots blocking the arteries of the lungs). People do not always fully recover from these disorders, and, very rarely, they are fatal. Studies suggest that these disorders occur less often with modern low-dose oral contraceptives than with older pills.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Certain conditions increase the risk of thrombosis. They include:
</BLOCK>


<LIST type="bulleted">

<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
smoking.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
obesity.
</BLOCK>

</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>

</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
varicose veins.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>

</LIST>



<BLOCK>
If any of these conditions apply to you before you decide to take this medicine or while you are taking it you must discuss them with your doctor.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The risk of arterial thrombosis (e.g. heart attack and stroke) associated with the pill increases with age, and this risk is increased by cigarette smoking. For this reason, the use of combined pills by women in the older age-group, especially those who also smoke, is discouraged.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Signs and symptoms of blood clots are given in the section Reasons for stopping Dianette immediately .
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The pill does give a substantial degree of protection against cancers of the ovary and the lining of the womb. An increased risk of cervical cancer in long-term users of the pill has been reported in some studies. It is uncertain whether this increased risk is caused by the pill as it could be due to the effects of sexual behaviour and other factors.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The evidence linking use of the pill and breast cancer is unclear. Some studies suggest an increased risk of breast cancer in women below the age of 35, the risk increasing the longer the pill is used. Any <PB n=3> <CB n=2> possible increased risk of breast cancer with combined pills is, however, likely to be small.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
On rare occasions, the use of the pill has led to liver diseases such as jaundice and benign liver tumours, and, very rarely, it has been associated with some forms of malignant liver tumours (cancer) in long-term users. Liver tumours may lead to life-threatening intra-abdominal haemorrhage (bleeding in the abdomen). Therefore, if you have pain in the upper abdomen that does not soon clear up, tell your doctor. Also, if your skin becomes yellow (jaundice) you must tell your doctor.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Certain conditions may sometimes get worse during use of the pill. The diseases are those listed under "What you should know before taking Dianette".

When can you expect to see improvement in your skin?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Unlike treatments that are rubbed on the skin, this treatment does not so much attack existing spots as reduce the formation of new spots. It does this by working at the point at which the androgens stimulate the grease-glands to produce too much grease. So the first thing that you will notice is that your skin has become much less greasy. This should be obvious in the first few weeks. After about three months you should see a definite improvement in acne. If you are taking this medicine to treat excessive hair growth on your body or face, you may have to wait a few months possibly longer, to see a definite improvement.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>
<DIV type=1>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
How long can you take Dianette?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Your doctor may stop treating you with this medicine when your skin is completely clear, or the amount of body and facial hair growth has decreased. You will be able to have further courses of treatment, for as long as is necessary, if the problem keeps returning.

</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
If you have no bleeding in the 7 day break, whether you have missed tablets or not, tell your doctor as soon as possible and do not start another pack until your doctor tells you to. In the meantime, do not have sex unless you use condoms or a cap plus spermicide.

What if you have bleeding between periods?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
A small number of women may have a little breakthrough bleeding or spotting while taking this medicine, especially during the first few months. Normally this bleeding is nothing to worry about, and will stop in a day or two. Keep taking the pills as usual, and the problem should disappear after the first few packs.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If the bleeding keeps on returning, is annoying or long-lasting, talk to your doctor. Also, if you start to have breakthrough bleeding for the first time after being on this medicine for a long time, you should see your doctor.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Unexpected bleeding may also be a sign of irregular pill-taking, so try to take your pill at the same time every day.

if your present pack ends before the 7 days do, start the next pack the next day, without a break. This means taking a pill every day during your normal 7 pill-free days. You will not have a period until you have finished the next pack, but this is not harmful. You may see some bleeding on pill-taking days, but do not worry. If no bleeding occurs in the 7 day break see the section entitled "What to do if you miss a period. "

What should you do if you lose a pill?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
If you lose a pill, the easiest thing to do is take the last pill of the pack in place of the lost pill. Then take all the pills on their proper days. Your cycle will be one day shorter than normal, but contraceptive protection <CB n=2> is not affected. After your 7 pill-free days you will have a new starting-day, one day earlier than before. Should you lose a pack of pills halfway through, ask your doctor or pharmacist what to do.

What if you want to have a baby?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
The bleeding you have after each pack (including the last pack) is not a true period. Your doctor relies on the date of your last true period before you get pregnant to tell you when your baby will be born. So, if you stop taking Dianette to have a baby, use another method of contraception until you have had a true period. However, it will not be harmful if you become pregnant straight away.

In addition to asking a pharmacist or your doctor for help, you can also help yourself by being aware of the things that can affect your acne.

Does washing alone heal acne?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Washing by itself is not going to heal your acne. All it does is keep the surface of the skin free from excess grease. While having clean skin is certain to have some beneficial effect, take care not to over-clean it. A certain amount of sebum is necessary to prevent the skin from becoming too dry, so excessive washing and scrubbing may do more harm than good.

Try to use a simple, unperfumed soap. If the soap you are using irritates your skin, use another one.

<HEAD slant="italic" >
Do cosmetics aggravate acne?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
it is tempting for girls to try to hide their acne with make-up. This rarely hides the spots, and it blocks the skin pores - a situation almost guaranteed to make the acne worse.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you want to wear make-up, use it sparingly and choose a light non-greasy lotion, not cold creams.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
TIP - 
<EMPH slant = "italic">
Face powders, lipsticks, eyebrow pencil, eyeliner and eyelash make-up virtually never produce acne and rare/y irritate the skin.

Are there any foods which should be avoided if you have acne?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Medical evidence has not shown conclusively that any particular foods cause acne. But if you do find that some foods seem to be related to sudden acne flare-ups, they try to avoid them for a while and see what happens. On food in general, your body and its ability to fight acne from the inside can only benefit from being fed a healthy and balanced diet.
</BLOCK>

<DIV type=2>

<HEAD slant="italic" >
Can other things make your acne worse?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Exposure to oils and grease (e.g. as a mechanic) can cause acne, as can other industrial chemicals. Very high temperatures, such as in a bakery, can result in excessive sweating and a worsening of your acne. On the other hand, sunlight is good for spots, and your acne may well improve during the summer months. However, don't use a sunlamp, or sunbathe for a long time without first taking advice from your doctor.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>
<DIV type=2>

<HEAD slant="italic" >
Are there times when acne gets worse?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Yes, too much stress and worry can often make your acne worse. Students often find that their acne flares up before and during exams, because stress increases the levels of hormones that induce acne. Also, under stress, people tend to pick at their acne.
</BLOCK>

<CB n=2>

<BLOCK>
Can the menstrual cycle affect acne?
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Yes it is not uncommon for acne to get worse for about 7-10 days before the onset of menstruation. This is due to the monthly changes in hormone levels.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
TIP - 
<EMPH slant = "italic">
Dianette or certain contraceptive pills, should lessen the effect of pre-menstrual acne.

Does squeezing help clear up acne?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Although the temptation is sometimes very strong, try not to squeeze your spots. Vigorous squeezing damages the skin and tends to spread the infection and inflammation and to delay healing. In some cases, it can cause permanent scarring. On those occasions when you just can't help yourself, squeeze the spot gently and be sure to dab on some disinfectant afterwards.

How long does it take for acne to disappear?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Just about everything concerning acne is 'unfair' and the length of time it takes to respond to treatment is no exception. Even the most effective products take time, sometimes a long time, before you can see any significant improvement. It will usually take several months of treatment before your acne clears up.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
You should also realise that as long as your tendency to acne persists, you are likely to need further treatment from time to time. So try to be patient, keep using your treatment regularly, and follow your doctor's instructions.
</BLOCK>

Does acne only occur in teenagers?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
No, although it is mainly a teenage problem, acne can occur both in early childhood and in adults even into their thirties and forties.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>
<DIV type=2>

<HEAD slant="italic" >
Can clothes affect acne?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Yes. If you have acne on your body, try to wear light loose clothes and avoid irritating fabrics such as wool and synthetic materials. Keep your underclothes, and clothes that come into contact with areas affected by acne, very clean.
