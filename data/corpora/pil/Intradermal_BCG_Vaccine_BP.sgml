<BLOCK>
PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY before you (or your child) are vaccinated.  This leaflet provides a summary of the information available on the vaccine.  If you have any questions or are not sure about anything, ask your doctor.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The name of this product is INTRADERMAL BCG VACCINE, BP.  It is one of a group of medicines called vaccines, which are used to protect people against infectious diseases.
</BLOCK>

<DIV type=1>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
What is in the vaccine?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
INTRADERMAL BCG Vaccine is a freeze-dried powder of a live, weakened strain of 
<EMPH slant = "italic">
Mycobacterium bovis
</EMPH>
 (the same type of bacteria that causes the infectious disease tuberculosis (TB), except that the weakened bacteria cannot cause the disease).  The powder is mixed with sterile water or sodium chloride solution before use.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
When mixed with the sterile water or sodium chloride solution, each ml of the vaccine contains the equivalent of not less than 8 million units of the weakened strain of the bacteria.  The vaccine also contains dextran, glucose, Triton WR 1339 and water.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The vaccine is supplied as a freeze-dried powder in 10 dose containers (in packs of 10 or in packs of 5 with 5 containers of sterile water).  The vaccine is also supplied in 50 dose containers (in packs of 5 with 5 containers of sodium chloride solution).

How does the vaccine work?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
When you are vaccinated with INTRADERMAL BCG Vaccine your body produces a response (called "cell-mediated immunity") against the weakened tuberculosis-causing bacteria.  If you later come into contact with TB, this same response will again be produced to protect you so that you do not catch the disease.

Warnings

You must not have another vaccination (injection) against infectious diseases in the same arm as your BCG vaccination for at least 3 months.  This is because it could produce inflammation in the local lymph glands.

<DIV type=1>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
How will you be given the vaccine?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
The vaccine will be made up and a dose withdrawn into a syringe.

<BLOCK>
For babies under three months of age your doctor will inject a single 0.05 ml dose of the vaccine into the skin. For children aged 3 months or over, adults and elderly the doctor will inject a single 0.1 ml dose of vaccine into the skin.

<BLOCK>
Your doctor will write down the name, dose and lot number of the vaccine, and the date it was given, in your (or your child's) medical records.

What side-effects might you (or your child) experience?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
A small swelling appears within 2-6 weeks and this may develop into a blister or ulcer, about 10 mm in diameter. It heals in 6-12 weeks, and a dry dressing can be used if the ulcer oozes. Be careful not to let tight clothing rub the ulcer.

Some people feel feverish, get a rash or have swollen glands after the vaccination.  Small babies occasionally get swollen glands in their arm-pits.
</BLOCK>

Very rarely, an abscess may form at the injection site or an allergic reaction may happen very soon after the injection.  This may cause collapse and breathing difficulties.
</BLOCK>
