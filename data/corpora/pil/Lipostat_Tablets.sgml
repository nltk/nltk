Q:WHAT IS THIS MEDICINE FOR?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
A.Lipostat is used to lower levels of cholesterol in the blood and should always be used together with a low fat diet. You probably feel quite well and would not notice you have high cholesterol, but too much of it in the blood stream is one of the important causes of heart attacks. Your doctor has prescribed Lipostat to try to reduce the chances of this happening.
