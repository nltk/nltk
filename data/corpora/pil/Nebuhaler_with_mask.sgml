<BLOCK>
Nebuhaler makes it easy for your child’s medicine to be breathed down into the lungs, where it is needed.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
It contains a ONE–WAY VALVE.  This means that when the inhaler canister is pressed down, the spray of medicine released will 
<EMPH weight="bold">
stay inside 
</EMPH>
Nebuhaler until you are ready to give it to your child.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The valve only OPENS UP when Nebuholer is tilted upwards.  This lets the medicine 
<EMPH weight="bold">
flow out
</EMPH>
 of Nebuhaler, through the valve and into the mask.  Your child will then breathe it down into their lungs.

</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
They should be taken apart and washed at least once or twice each week in warm soapy water.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
To make washing easier the mask should be taken off the Nebuhaler.

Bricanyl acts by opening up the airways quickly to make breathing easier when your child feels wheezy or tight chested.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Pulmicort is designed to help prevent the attack and must be used regularly at the dose and times recommended by your  doctor.  It will not help once on attack has started so do not give your child extra doses. However, you should still carry on using Pulmicort at the prescribed times.
