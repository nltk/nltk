If you notice your asthma is getting worse particularly if you have only been taking Pulmicort Turbohaler once daily (eg you are using your blue relief inhaler more often or you hove more symptoms) you should double your dose of Pulmicort immediately and talk to your doctor as soon as possible.

If you are already taking it twice daily double your dose by simply taking double the number of inhalations  each time.
