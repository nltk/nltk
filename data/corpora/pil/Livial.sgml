MORE about LIVIAL
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
At the menopause (or after removal of the ovaries) the body stops producing the female hormone, oestrogen. There can also be other medical reasons for low oestrogen levels. The shortage of oestrogen causes complaints such as hot flushes and night sweats. Some women feel depressed and lose their sex drive. Livial can relieve these complaints.
