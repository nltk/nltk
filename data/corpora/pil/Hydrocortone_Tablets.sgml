How does your medicine work?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
The active ingredient in your medicine is hydrocortisone. This belongs to a group of medicines known as corticosteroids that are used to replace the hormones that you lack.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Some steroids, including hydrocortisone, occur naturally in the body and help to maintain health and well-being.

</HEAD>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
Why do you need to take these tablets?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Your doctor has prescribed Hydrocortone for you because you have a condition known as adrenocortical insufficiency. The adrenal cortex, part of the adrenal glands situated near the kidneys, produces hormones called corticosteroids. Your adrenal cortex is not producing sufficient amounts of these corticosteroids to keep your body working properly. The hydrocortisone in your tablets replaces the natural steroids that you lack and helps to keep you healthy.
