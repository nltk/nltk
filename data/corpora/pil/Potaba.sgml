<HEAD weight="bold" >
Why is Potaba prescribed?
</HEAD>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
How does it work?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Understanding of drug mechanism at the cellular level is incomplete in the case of many medications. It is thought that Potaba has an antifibrotic effect due to increased oxygen uptake at the tissue level.

What is the advantage of taking Potaba?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Therapy with Potaba is non-toxic, low-risk treatment for conditions that are usually long-term. This regimen represents a good possibility of softening hardened tissue. As there is a very low incidence of drug interactions, many other medications may be continued while you are taking Potaba. It is highly soluble in water and therefore readily absorbed.

Are there foods, drink or activities I should avoid while taking Potaba?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Potaba therapy is most acceptable when taken in conjunction with meals or snacks.

Usual activities can be encouraged.

<BLOCK>
Potaba is taken four times a day after meals or snacks. If you are unable to eat, omit dosage until eating again.

Potaba is supplied in three dosage forms: Envules, Capsules and Tablets. Changing dosage form may prevent medication burn-out. (Medication burn-out is a term to describe a situation in which the patient stops taking medication. In consequence, the desired results of therapy will not be seen.)
