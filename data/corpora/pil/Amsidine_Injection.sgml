The average starting dose is 90 mg per day for each square metre of your body area for 5 - 8 days.

Following this initial dosing period further doses will be given every 3 - 4 weeks, depending on the number of your blood cells. This second course of treatment will generally be one third of the original dose and will either be given all on one day or divided up over 3 days.
