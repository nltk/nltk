ABOUT AXSAIN
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Axsain cream contains capsaicin (0.075%), a naturally occurring substance found in plants of the Solanaceae family.  Research has shown that Axsain may work by reducing levels of a chemical (substance P), which is involved in transmitting pain impulses to the brain.  
<EMPH weight="bold">
Axsain therefore has a topical analgesic effect.
