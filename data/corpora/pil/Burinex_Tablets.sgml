What are Burinex Tablets for?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Burinex Tablets are for problems where there is too much water in your body. The medical name for this is 'oedema'. The bumetanide in your tablets helps your kidneys to get rid of water that is not needed in your body.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Oedema happens for different reasons. One example is when your heart cannot pump strongly enough. This lets water collect in the wrong parts of your body. You get breathless and your legs get swollen. Getting rid of the extra water helps you to breathe more easily, and makes things easier for your heart.
</BLOCK>

<CB n=1>

<BLOCK>
Another cause of oedema is when your kidneys are not working well. They stop producing enough urine to get rid of water and waste products. One example of a kidney problem when this happens is called 'nephrotic syndrome'. Liver problems can cause oedema too.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Burinex 5mg Tablets are used especially where oedema is caused by heart or kidney problems and where a larger dose is needed.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
There are other reasons why you may need a diuretic. Speak to your doctor if you are not sure why Burinex Tablets have been prescribed for you.
