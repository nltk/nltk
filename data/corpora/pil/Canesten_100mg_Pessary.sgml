PESSARIES?
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The pessaries should be used to treat vaginal thrush .
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Vaginal thrush (candidiasis) is a common infection caused by a fungus which may live harmlessly in the vagina without you even noticing it.  However, in certain circumstances it may develop into an infection in the vagina and the symptoms may spread to the surrounding area (the vulva).
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The common symptoms of thrush are:
</BLOCK>

WHEN AND HOW DO I USE CANESTEN 100MG PESSARIES?
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The carton contains six Canesten 100mg Pessaries held inside a foil blister pack, and an applicator for insertion of the pessaries into the vagina.  This is a full course of treatment.  However, in the event that your symptoms persist upon completion of the course, see your doctor as he/she may recommend further treatment.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The applicator should be used to insert a pessary into the vagina before going to sleep on six consecutive nights. Alternatively, two pessaries may be inserted into the vagina before going to sleep on three consecutive nights.

<FIGURE></FIGURE>

<BLOCK>

<EMPH weight="bold">
Remove the applicator from the packaging.  Pull out plunger A until it stops.  Remove a pessary from the blister pack and place the pessary firmly into applicator B (Diagram 1).  To fit the pessary into the applicator, the holder of the applicator needs to be squeezed lightly at either side.  The pessary fits tightly into
</EMPH>
 
<EMPH weight="bold">
the applicator and needs to be squeezed into the holder just far enough to be held in place during insertion (about 1cm).
</EMPH>

</BLOCK>

<PB n=4>
<CB n=1>

<BLOCK>
Carefully put the applicator as deeply as is comfortable into the vagina (this is easiest when lying on your back with your knees bent up) (Diagram 2).
</BLOCK>

<FIGURE></FIGURE>

<BLOCK>
Holding the applicator in place, slowly press the plunger until it stops so that the pessary is deposited into the 
<EMPH slant = "italic">
vagina
</EMPH>
.  Remove the applicator.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
After use, remove plunger A completely by pulling it out of the applicator B.  Then wash it in warm (not boiling) soapy water, rinse and dry carefully (Diagram 3).
</BLOCK>

<FIGURE></FIGURE>

<BLOCK>
The symptoms of thrush such as burning, soreness or itching of the vagina and surrounding area should disappear within three days of treatment.  If no improvement is seen after 7 days, tell your doctor.
</BLOCK>

<CB n=2>

<BLOCK>
You can help prevent further infections if you follow these simple self-help tips:
</BLOCK>


<LIST type="bulleted">

<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
Try to avoid wearing tight nylon knickers and close fitting jeans too often.  These provide warm and airless conditions which help the thrush fungus to grow.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
Wash daily, but use simple, unperfumed soaps – not heavily scented or medicated ones.  Do not scrub hard with sponges or flannels, and avoid hot baths with strong perfumed oils or disinfectants.  The most soothing bath to have if you have thrush is a warm one with some salt in it.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>


<ITEM>

<BLOCK>
After going to the toilet, do get into the habit of wiping yourself from front to back, as a thrush infection may easily be transferred from the bowel.
</BLOCK>

</ITEM>

</LIST>



<BLOCK>
If you are still worried or have any further questions about the symptoms or the treatment, do not hesitate to ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Canesten Pessaries should be used in the 
<EMPH slant = "italic">

</EMPH>

</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I FORGET TO USE MY CANESTEN 100MG PESSARIES?
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Canesten  Pessaries should be used for six 
<EMPH slant = "italic">
consecutive
</EMPH>
 nights if one pessary is used, or three consecutive nights if two pessaries are used.  However, if you forget to insert a pessary, follow the advice given below:
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
When you remember, continue with your course of treatment.  If you have forgotten for more than one day, your infection may not be fully treated, so if symptoms persist upon completion of this course, please arrange to see your doctor
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you forget to use the cream, apply it as soon as possible and then continue the rest of your treatment as usual.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
WHAT SIDE-EFFECTS MAY I EXPERIENCE?
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Rarely, Canesten 100 mg Pessaries  may cause side-effects in some people.  The side-effects are very similar to the symptoms of thrush.  If the redness, burning, irritation or swelling get worse, stop using the pessaries and see your doctor as soon as possible. 
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
As with all medicines, some people may be allergic to the Canesten Pessaries.  Usually, if you are allergic to the pessaries, a reaction will occur soon after you start using it.  An allergic reaction may appear as a rash, nausea,  faintness or facial swelling.  If you experience any of these effects, tell your doctor Immediately.

<BLOCK>
