It is important to take your medicine at the right times and in the right dose.  For example, to prevent period pains your doctor may have recommended that you start taking Buscopan tablets two days before the start of your next period.  Your doctor should have told you how often to take your tablets and his instructions should be on the label.  If they are not or you are not sure, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

<BLOCK>
The tablets should be swallowed whole with water before meals.

If you forget to take a dose take one as soon as you remember.  Then go on as before.
