How this medicine works and what it is used for
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
The action of Humegon is similar to that of two different, natural hormones, follicle-stimulating hormone {FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). In women these hormones are needed to ripen the egg cell: in men they are needed in the production of sperm. Humegon is used in fertility disorders that are caused by a shortage of these hormones. It is also used in in-vitro (test tube) fertilization. On the back of this leaflet you will find more information about the action and use of Humegon.

Close supervision
</EMPH>
 of female patients is extremely important. Usually blood sampling and ultrasound are performed daily. The results of these tests allow the doctor to choose the proper dose from day to day. This is very important since too high a dose may lead to overstimulation of the ovaries. This may be noticed as pain in the abdomen. Should you be troubled with pain in the abdomen, contact your doctor without delay.

MORE ABOUT HUMEGON
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
The action of Humegon is similar to that of two different, natural hormones, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). In both men and women these hormones are produced in the pituitary gland. Together FSH and LH control the action of the sexual glands (ovaries in women and testes in men).
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
In women FSH and LH ensure the monthly ripening of the follicle, a tiny cavity in which the egg cell develops. LH is also needed for ovulation, the release of the egg cell. If the body itself does not produce enough FSH and LH, infertility may be the result. In these cases Humegon can be used to make up the shortage. To determine the right dosage a daily check is necessary. The amount of oestrogens (female hormones) in blood or urine is measured and the follicle size is determined by means of ultrasound. When the follicle is big enough, another hormone (for instance Pregnyl) is given. This is a strong LH preparation which causes ovulation. In spite of the careful monitoring more than one egg cell is released. This increases the chance of twins or multiplets.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
In men very high LH activity is necessary for the production of sperm cells. Therefore extra Pregnyl injections are usually given as well as Humegon. Because the development of sperm cells takes about 74 days, treatment should be continued for at least 10 to 12 weeks before any improvement can be expected.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Infertility can also be the result of causes other than a shortage of FSH and LH. In these cases artificial techniques are sometimes used, for instance test-tube fertilization (in-vitro fertilization). For this technique several egg cells are needed and Humegon is used to cause a number of egg cells to develop.
