<BLOCK>
The name of your medicine is Zyloric-300 (allopurinol). It belongs to a group of medicines called enzyme inhibitors, which act, like a water-tap, to control the rate at which special chemical changes occur in the body. It is used to prevent gout and other conditions associated with excess uric acid in the body, including calcium stones in the kidney.

It is important to take your medicine every day. The label on the carton should tell you how many tablets to take and how often. If it doesn't or you are not sure, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

The usual dosage for adults is one Zyloric-300mg tablet, each day. Try to take your tablet at the same time each day. It helps you to remember if you do this as part of your daily routine, for example, at breakfast time.

The back of the tablet blister strip is marked in days of the week. Press your first tablet out through the foil marked with today's day - for instance, if today is Tuesday, use one marked 'Tue', move onto the 'Wed' tablet tomorrow, and so on. This will help you to check that you have taken each tablet on the correct day. Follow the arrows, and do not start another blister strip of tablets until the first is finished. You should then start a new blister strip (on the same day you started the first one) every two weeks.

About Gout
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Gout is caused by having high levels of uric acid in the blood. If too much uric acid is present in the blood, some of it can form into needle-like crystals - often in the joints. Your body tries to fight these, which causes pain and swelling.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Zyloric-300 works by controlling the amount of uric acid in your blood, stopping the crystals from forming, and so avoids the pain and swelling. If you stop taking the tablets, control is lost, so you would once again be likely to get an attack.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
It is not unusual for the number of gouty attacks to increase until your uric acid level becomes stable as it may take a while for Zyloric-300 to achieve full control. Your doctor may prescribe extra medicines to help until the uric acid level is reduced.
</BLOCK>

<CB n=2>

<BLOCK>
Gout affects all sorts of people. Mostly it seems to be an hereditary illness, though diet may also be partly responsible in some cases. Your doctor may suggest that you try to avoid certain foods (kidneys, liver, sardines, turkey, shellfish) and excess alcohol. You may be asked to drink plenty of water, avoid the cold and not over-eat. If you follow your doctor's advice and take your Zyloric-300 tablet daily, you should get no further attacks of gout.
