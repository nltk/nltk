BEFORE TAKING YOUR MEDICINE
</EMPH>
 What should I do if I think I am pregnant (or I am breast feeding)?  'Ridaura' should not be taken when you are pregnant or when you are breast feeding.  If you think there is a chance that you are pregnant, ask your doctor before starting the treatment.  Women who can have children should take full contraceptive precautions during treatment (and for at least six months after treatment has stopped.)

TAKING YOUR MEDICINE
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
'Ridaura Tiltab' Tablets should be swallowed with water.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>

<EMPH weight="bold">
How much should I take and how often?
</EMPH>
  Do as your doctor tells you and read the label on the container carefully; it will tell you how many 'Ridaura' tablets to take for each dose and when to take them.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
DO NOT TAKE MORE THAN THE DOSE YOUR DOCTOR HAS RECOMMENDED. Ask your pharmacist or doctor if you are not sure.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>

<EMPH weight="bold">
How long should I carry on taking 'Ridaura Tiltab' Tablets?
</EMPH>
  For as long as your doctor tells you. It may well be three or four months before you notice any improvement in your arthritis symptoms.  If you stop your treatment too early, you could have a flare-up of your rheumatoid arthritis.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>

<EMPH weight="bold">
What should I do if I forget to take a dose? 
</EMPH>
 It is very important that you take 'Ridaura' doses as you have been told.  However, if you forget to take a dose at the right time, take it as soon as you remember.  Then carry on as before, but do not take two doses within an hour of each other.

AFTER TAKING YOUR MEDICINE
</HEAD>

<EMPH weight="bold">
What unwanted effects might the tablets have?
</EMPH>
  Serious side effects with 'Ridaura' are uncommon.  Some patients may have loose bowel motions during the first few weeks of treatment with 'Ridaura'.  But this usually clears up quite quickly by itself and a high-fibre diet may be helpful.  You may have nausea or abdominal pain but these are less common.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
If you suffer badly, tell your doctor.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Tell your doctor immediately if you develop any unusual symptoms, such as:
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Itching or rash, metallic taste, sore throat or tongue, mouth ulcers, easy bruising, nose bleeds, bleeding gums, heavy periods, bleeding from the back passage, cloudy urine, dry cough or unexplained breathlessness.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
Your doctor will carry out blood and urine tests regularly to check for any side effects and to monitor the progress of your treatment.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>

<EMPH weight="bold">
What if I have taken too much?
</EMPH>
  If a large amount has been taken, consult your doctor or local hospital casualty department at once.
