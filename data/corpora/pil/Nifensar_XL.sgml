What's in your tablets
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
NIFENSAR XL Tablets are yellow with N20 embossed on one side. Each tablet contains 20mg of a medicine called nifedipine.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The tablets have been made so that after you have swallowed them the medicine is slowly released in your body. This means that you only have to remember to take your tablets once each day. "XL" in the name of the tablets stands for "Extra Long" action.
