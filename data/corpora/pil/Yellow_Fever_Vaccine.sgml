The name of this product is ARILVAX, or YELLOW FEVER VACCINE, LIVE BP.  It is one of a group of medicines called vaccines, which are used to protect people against infectious diseases.
</BLOCK>

<DIV type=1>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
What is in the vaccine?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
Arilvax contains a freeze-dried powder of a live, weakened yellow fever virus (the same type of virus that causes the infectious disease yellow fever except that the weakened virus cannot cause the disease).  The powder is mixed with sterile water before use.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
When mixed with the sterile water supplied with the vaccine, each 0.5ml dose of the vaccine contains the equivalent of not less than 1000 units of the weakened strain of the virus.  The vaccine also contains polymyxin B sulphate, neomycin sulphate, sorbitol, gelatin, sodium chloride, disodium hydrogen orthophosphate, potassium chloride, potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate, water and traces of egg derived protein.
</BLOCK>


<BLOCK>
The vaccine is supplied as a freeze-dried powder in single-dose or 5-dose containers (in packs of 5 with sterile water).  Sterile water (for dissolving the freeze-dried powder) is supplied in glass containers (with the vaccine).  Your doctor will mix the freeze-dried powder and sterile water together and will withdraw 0.5ml of the mixture into a syringe for your (or your child’s) vaccination.
</BLOCK>


</DIV>
<DIV type=1>

<HEAD weight="bold" >
How does the vaccine work?
</HEAD>


<BLOCK>
When you are vaccinated with Arilvax your body produces a response (involving the production of antibodies) against the weakened yellow fever virus.  If you later come into contact with the disease-causing virus, this same response will again be produced to protect you.
