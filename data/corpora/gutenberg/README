Project Gutenberg Selections
http://gutenberg.net/

This corpus contains etexts from from Project Gutenberg,
by the following authors:

* Jane Austen (3)
* William Blake (2)
* G. K. Chesterton (3)
* King James Bible
* Herman Melville
* John Milton
* William Shakespeare (3)
* Walt Whitman

The beginning of the body of each book could not be identified automatically,
so a marker: "@@@@@@@@" has been inserted into each file.  Some files ended
with a line "End of The Project Gutenberg Etext...", and this has been deleted.
