File: phoncode.doc, updated 10/12/90

This file contains a table of all the phonemic and phonetic symbols used in
the TIMIT lexicon and in the phonetic transcriptions.  These include the
stress markers {1,2} found only in the lexicon and the following symbols which
occur only in the transcriptions:

1) the closure intervals of stops which are distinguished from the stop
   release.  The closure symbols for the stops b,d,g,p,t,k are
   bcl,dcl,gcl,pcl,tck,kcl, respectively.  The closure portions of jh
   and ch, are dcl and tcl.

2) allophones that do not occur in the lexicon.  The use of a given 
   allophone may be dependent on the speaker, dialect, speaking rate, 
   and phonemic context, among other factors.  Since the use of these 
   allophones is difficult to predict, they have not been used in the 
   phonemic transcriptions in the lexicon.

  - flap dx,  such as in words "muddy" or "dirty"
  
  - nasal flap nx, as in "winner"

  - glottal stop q, which may be an allophone of t, or may mark an initial 
    vowel or a vowel-vowel boundary

  - voiced-h hv, a voiced allophone of h, typically found intervocalically

  - fronted-u ux, allophone of uw, typically found in alveolar context

  - devoiced-schwa ax-h, very short, devoiced vowel, typically occurring
    for reduced vowels surrounded by voiceless consonants

3) other symbols include two types of silence; pau, marking a pause, and
   epi, denoting epenthetic silence which is often found between a fricative 
   and a semivowel or nasal, as in "slow", and h#, used to mark the silence
   and/or non-speech events found at the beginning and end of the signal.
