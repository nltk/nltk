<STAGEDIR>Enter DEMETRIUS and PHILO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHILO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, but this dotage of our general's</LINE>
<LINE>O'erflows the measure: those his goodly eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>That o'er the files and musters of the war</LINE>
<LINE>Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,</LINE>
<LINE>The office and devotion of their view</LINE>
<LINE>Upon a tawny front: his captain's heart,</LINE>
<LINE>Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst</LINE>
<LINE>The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,</LINE>
<LINE>And is become the bellows and the fan</LINE>
<LINE>To cool a gipsy's lust.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Flourish. Enter ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, her Ladies,
the Train, with Eunuchs fanning her</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Look, where they come:</LINE>
<LINE>Take but good note, and you shall see in him.</LINE>
<LINE>The triple pillar of the world transform'd</LINE>
<LINE>Into a strumpet's fool: behold and see.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If it be love indeed, tell me how much.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter an Attendant</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Attendant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>News, my good lord, from Rome.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Grates me: the sum.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, hear them, Antony:</LINE>
<LINE>Fulvia perchance is angry; or, who knows</LINE>
<LINE>If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent</LINE>
<LINE>His powerful mandate to you, 'Do this, or this;</LINE>
<LINE>Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that;</LINE>
<LINE>Perform 't, or else we damn thee.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How, my love!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Perchance! nay, and most like:</LINE>
<LINE>You must not stay here longer, your dismission</LINE>
<LINE>Is come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony.</LINE>
<LINE>Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I would say? both?</LINE>
<LINE>Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's queen,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou blushest, Antony; and that blood of thine</LINE>
<LINE>Is Caesar's homager: else so thy cheek pays shame</LINE>
<LINE>When shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch</LINE>
<LINE>Of the ranged empire fall! Here is my space.</LINE>
<LINE>Kingdoms are clay: our dungy earth alike</LINE>
<LINE>Feeds beast as man: the nobleness of life</LINE>
<LINE>Is to do thus; when such a mutual pair</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Embracing</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>And such a twain can do't, in which I bind,</LINE>
<LINE>On pain of punishment, the world to weet</LINE>
<LINE>We stand up peerless.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Excellent falsehood!</LINE>
<LINE>Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?</LINE>
<LINE>I'll seem the fool I am not; Antony</LINE>
<LINE>Will be himself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But stirr'd by Cleopatra.</LINE>
<LINE>Now, for the love of Love and her soft hours,</LINE>
<LINE>Let's not confound the time with conference harsh:</LINE>
<LINE>There's not a minute of our lives should stretch</LINE>
<LINE>Without some pleasure now. What sport tonight?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hear the ambassadors.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fie, wrangling queen!</LINE>
<LINE>Whom every thing becomes, to chide, to laugh,</LINE>
<LINE>To weep; whose every passion fully strives</LINE>
<LINE>To make itself, in thee, fair and admired!</LINE>
<LINE>No messenger, but thine; and all alone</LINE>
<LINE>To-night we'll wander through the streets and note</LINE>
<LINE>The qualities of people. Come, my queen;</LINE>
<LINE>Last night you did desire it: speak not to us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exeunt MARK ANTONY and CLEOPATRA with
their train</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DEMETRIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is Caesar with Antonius prized so slight?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHILO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, sometimes, when he is not Antony,</LINE>
<LINE>He comes too short of that great property</LINE>
<LINE>Which still should go with Antony.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DEMETRIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am full sorry</LINE>
<LINE>That he approves the common liar, who</LINE>
<LINE>Thus speaks of him at Rome: but I will hope</LINE>
<LINE>Of better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy!</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most any thing Alexas,</LINE>
<LINE>almost most absolute Alexas, where's the soothsayer</LINE>
<LINE>that you praised so to the queen? O, that I knew</LINE>
<LINE>this husband, which, you say, must charge his horns</LINE>
<LINE>with garlands!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALEXAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Soothsayer!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Soothsayer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your will?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Soothsayer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In nature's infinite book of secrecy</LINE>
<LINE>A little I can read.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALEXAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Show him your hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enough</LINE>
<LINE>Cleopatra's health to drink.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good sir, give me good fortune.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Soothsayer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I make not, but foresee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pray, then, foresee me one.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Soothsayer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You shall be yet far fairer than you are.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He means in flesh.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IRAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, you shall paint when you are old.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wrinkles forbid!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALEXAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Vex not his prescience; be attentive.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hush!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Soothsayer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You shall be more beloving than beloved.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I had rather heat my liver with drinking.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALEXAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, hear him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married</LINE>
<LINE>to three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all:</LINE>
<LINE>let me have a child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry</LINE>
<LINE>may do homage: find me to marry me with Octavius</LINE>
<LINE>Caesar, and companion me with my mistress.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Soothsayer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O excellent! I love long life better than figs.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Soothsayer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have seen and proved a fairer former fortune</LINE>
<LINE>Than that which is to approach.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then belike my children shall have no names:</LINE>
<LINE>prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Soothsayer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If every of your wishes had a womb.</LINE>
<LINE>And fertile every wish, a million.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALEXAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, come, tell Iras hers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALEXAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We'll know all our fortunes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mine, and most of our fortunes, to-night, shall</LINE>
<LINE>be--drunk to bed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IRAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There's a palm presages chastity, if nothing else.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IRAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful</LINE>
<LINE>prognostication, I cannot scratch mine ear. Prithee,</LINE>
<LINE>tell her but a worky-day fortune.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Soothsayer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your fortunes are alike.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IRAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But how, but how? give me particulars.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Soothsayer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have said.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IRAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than</LINE>
<LINE>I, where would you choose it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IRAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not in my husband's nose.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Our worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas,--come,</LINE>
<LINE>his fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a woman</LINE>
<LINE>that cannot go, sweet Isis, I beseech thee! and let</LINE>
<LINE>her die too, and give him a worse! and let worst</LINE>
<LINE>follow worse, till the worst of all follow him</LINE>
<LINE>laughing to his grave, fifty-fold a cuckold! Good</LINE>
<LINE>Isis, hear me this prayer, though thou deny me a</LINE>
<LINE>matter of more weight; good Isis, I beseech thee!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IRAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people!</LINE>
<LINE>for, as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man</LINE>
<LINE>loose-wived, so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a</LINE>
<LINE>foul knave uncuckolded: therefore, dear Isis, keep</LINE>
<LINE>decorum, and fortune him accordingly!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Amen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALEXAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lo, now, if it lay in their hands to make me a</LINE>
<LINE>cuckold, they would make themselves whores, but</LINE>
<LINE>they'ld do't!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hush! here comes Antony.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Saw you my lord?</LINE>

<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, lady.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Was he not here?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, madam.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He was disposed to mirth; but on the sudden</LINE>
<LINE>A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Seek him, and bring him hither.</LINE>
<LINE>Where's Alexas?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALEXAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here, at your service. My lord approaches.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fulvia thy wife first came into the field.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Against my brother Lucius?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay:</LINE>
<LINE>But soon that war had end, and the time's state</LINE>
<LINE>Made friends of them, joining their force 'gainst Caesar;</LINE>
<LINE>Whose better issue in the war, from Italy,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the first encounter, drave them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, what worst?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The nature of bad news infects the teller.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>When it concerns the fool or coward. On:</LINE>
<LINE>Things that are past are done with me. 'Tis thus:</LINE>
<LINE>Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death,</LINE>
<LINE>I hear him as he flatter'd.</LINE>

<LINE>O, my lord!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Speak to me home, mince not the general tongue:</LINE>
<LINE>Name Cleopatra as she is call'd in Rome;</LINE>
<LINE>Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase; and taunt my faults</LINE>
<LINE>With such full licence as both truth and malice</LINE>
<LINE>Have power to utter. O, then we bring forth weeds,</LINE>
<LINE>When our quick minds lie still; and our ills told us</LINE>
<LINE>Is as our earing. Fare thee well awhile.</LINE>

<LINE>Forbear me.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Second Messenger</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it:</LINE>
<LINE>What our contempt doth often hurl from us,</LINE>
<LINE>We wish it ours again; the present pleasure,</LINE>
<LINE>By revolution lowering, does become</LINE>
<LINE>The opposite of itself: she's good, being gone;</LINE>
<LINE>The hand could pluck her back that shoved her on.</LINE>
<LINE>I must from this enchanting queen break off:</LINE>
<LINE>Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,</LINE>
<LINE>My idleness doth hatch. How now! Enobarbus!</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I must with haste from hence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, then, we kill all our women:</LINE>
<LINE>we see how mortal an unkindness is to them;</LINE>
<LINE>if they suffer our departure, death's the word.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I must be gone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Under a compelling occasion, let women die; it were</LINE>
<LINE>pity to cast them away for nothing; though, between</LINE>
<LINE>them and a great cause, they should be esteemed</LINE>
<LINE>nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of</LINE>
<LINE>this, dies instantly; I have seen her die twenty</LINE>
<LINE>times upon far poorer moment: I do think there is</LINE>
<LINE>mettle in death, which commits some loving act upon</LINE>
<LINE>her, she hath such a celerity in dying.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alack, sir, no; her passions are made of nothing but</LINE>
<LINE>the finest part of pure love: we cannot call her</LINE>
<LINE>winds and waters sighs and tears; they are greater</LINE>
<LINE>storms and tempests than almanacs can report: this</LINE>
<LINE>cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes a</LINE>
<LINE>shower of rain as well as Jove.</LINE>

<LINE>Would I had never seen her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece</LINE>

<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When</LINE>
<LINE>it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man</LINE>
<LINE>from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth;</LINE>
<LINE>comforting therein, that when old robes are worn</LINE>
<LINE>out, there are members to make new. If there were</LINE>
<LINE>no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut,</LINE>
<LINE>and the case to be lamented: this grief is crowned</LINE>
<LINE>with consolation; your old smock brings forth a new</LINE>
<LINE>petticoat: and indeed the tears live in an onion</LINE>
<LINE>that should water this sorrow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The business she hath broached in the state</LINE>
<LINE>Cannot endure my absence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And the business you have broached here cannot be</LINE>
<LINE>without you; especially that of Cleopatra's, which</LINE>
<LINE>wholly depends on your abode.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No more light answers. Let our officers</LINE>
<LINE>Have notice what we purpose. I shall break</LINE>
<LINE>The cause of our expedience to the queen,</LINE>
<LINE>And get her leave to part. For not alone</LINE>
<LINE>The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,</LINE>
<LINE>Do strongly speak to us; but the letters too</LINE>
<LINE>Of many our contriving friends in Rome</LINE>
<LINE>Petition us at home: Sextus Pompeius</LINE>
<LINE>Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands</LINE>
<LINE>The empire of the sea: our slippery people,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose love is never link'd to the deserver</LINE>
<LINE>Till his deserts are past, begin to throw</LINE>
<LINE>Pompey the Great and all his dignities</LINE>
<LINE>Upon his son; who, high in name and power,</LINE>
<LINE>Higher than both in blood and life, stands up</LINE>
<LINE>For the main soldier: whose quality, going on,</LINE>
<LINE>The sides o' the world may danger: much is breeding,</LINE>
<LINE>Which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life,</LINE>
<LINE>And not a serpent's poison. Say, our pleasure,</LINE>
<LINE>To such whose place is under us, requires</LINE>
<LINE>Our quick remove from hence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where is he?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I did not see him since.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>See where he is, who's with him, what he does:</LINE>
<LINE>I did not send you: if you find him sad,</LINE>
<LINE>Say I am dancing; if in mirth, report</LINE>
<LINE>That I am sudden sick: quick, and return.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exit ALEXAS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,</LINE>
<LINE>You do not hold the method to enforce</LINE>
<LINE>The like from him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What should I do, I do not?</LINE>

<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In each thing give him way, cross him nothing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou teachest like a fool; the way to lose him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear:</LINE>
<LINE>In time we hate that which we often fear.</LINE>
<LINE>But here comes Antony.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter MARK ANTONY</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am sick and sullen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Help me away, dear Charmian; I shall fall:</LINE>
<LINE>It cannot be thus long, the sides of nature</LINE>
<LINE>Will not sustain it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, my dearest queen,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pray you, stand further from me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's the matter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know, by that same eye, there's some good news.</LINE>
<LINE>What says the married woman? You may go:</LINE>
<LINE>Would she had never given you leave to come!</LINE>
<LINE>Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here:</LINE>
<LINE>I have no power upon you; hers you are.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The gods best know,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, never was there queen</LINE>
<LINE>So mightily betray'd! yet at the first</LINE>
<LINE>I saw the treasons planted.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cleopatra,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why should I think you can be mine and true,</LINE>
<LINE>Though you in swearing shake the throned gods,</LINE>
<LINE>Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,</LINE>
<LINE>To be entangled with those mouth-made vows,</LINE>
<LINE>Which break themselves in swearing!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most sweet queen,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, pray you, seek no colour for your going,</LINE>
<LINE>But bid farewell, and go: when you sued staying,</LINE>
<LINE>Then was the time for words: no going then;</LINE>
<LINE>Eternity was in our lips and eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>Bliss in our brows' bent; none our parts so poor,</LINE>
<LINE>But was a race of heaven: they are so still,</LINE>
<LINE>Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,</LINE>
<LINE>Art turn'd the greatest liar.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now, lady!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would I had thy inches; thou shouldst know</LINE>
<LINE>There were a heart in Egypt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hear me, queen:</LINE>
<LINE>The strong necessity of time commands</LINE>
<LINE>Our services awhile; but my full heart</LINE>
<LINE>Remains in use with you. Our Italy</LINE>
<LINE>Shines o'er with civil swords: Sextus Pompeius</LINE>
<LINE>Makes his approaches to the port of Rome:</LINE>
<LINE>Equality of two domestic powers</LINE>
<LINE>Breed scrupulous faction: the hated, grown to strength,</LINE>
<LINE>Are newly grown to love: the condemn'd Pompey,</LINE>
<LINE>Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace,</LINE>
<LINE>Into the hearts of such as have not thrived</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten;</LINE>
<LINE>And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge</LINE>
<LINE>By any desperate change: my more particular,</LINE>
<LINE>And that which most with you should safe my going,</LINE>
<LINE>Is Fulvia's death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Though age from folly could not give me freedom,</LINE>
<LINE>It does from childishness: can Fulvia die?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She's dead, my queen:</LINE>
<LINE>Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read</LINE>
<LINE>The garboils she awaked; at the last, best:</LINE>
<LINE>See when and where she died.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O most false love!</LINE>
<LINE>Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill</LINE>
<LINE>With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,</LINE>
<LINE>In Fulvia's death, how mine received shall be.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Quarrel no more, but be prepared to know</LINE>
<LINE>The purposes I bear; which are, or cease,</LINE>
<LINE>As you shall give the advice. By the fire</LINE>
<LINE>That quickens Nilus' slime, I go from hence</LINE>
<LINE>Thy soldier, servant; making peace or war</LINE>
<LINE>As thou affect'st.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cut my lace, Charmian, come;</LINE>
<LINE>But let it be: I am quickly ill, and well,</LINE>
<LINE>So Antony loves.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My precious queen, forbear;</LINE>
<LINE>And give true evidence to his love, which stands</LINE>
<LINE>An honourable trial.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So Fulvia told me.</LINE>
<LINE>I prithee, turn aside and weep for her,</LINE>
<LINE>Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears</LINE>
<LINE>Belong to Egypt: good now, play one scene</LINE>
<LINE>Of excellent dissembling; and let it look</LINE>
<LINE>Life perfect honour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You'll heat my blood: no more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You can do better yet; but this is meetly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, by my sword,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And target. Still he mends;</LINE>
<LINE>But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian,</LINE>
<LINE>How this Herculean Roman does become</LINE>
<LINE>The carriage of his chafe.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll leave you, lady.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Courteous lord, one word.</LINE>
<LINE>Sir, you and I must part, but that's not it:</LINE>
<LINE>Sir, you and I have loved, but there's not it;</LINE>
<LINE>That you know well: something it is I would,</LINE>
<LINE>O, my oblivion is a very Antony,</LINE>
<LINE>And I am all forgotten.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But that your royalty</LINE>
<LINE>Holds idleness your subject, I should take you</LINE>
<LINE>For idleness itself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis sweating labour</LINE>
<LINE>To bear such idleness so near the heart</LINE>
<LINE>As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me;</LINE>
<LINE>Since my becomings kill me, when they do not</LINE>
<LINE>Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly.</LINE>
<LINE>And all the gods go with you! upon your sword</LINE>
<LINE>Sit laurel victory! and smooth success</LINE>
<LINE>Be strew'd before your feet!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let us go. Come;</LINE>
<LINE>Our separation so abides, and flies,</LINE>
<LINE>That thou, residing here, go'st yet with me,</LINE>
<LINE>And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee. Away!</LINE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE IV.  Rome. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, reading a letter, LEPIDUS,
and their Train</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,</LINE>
<LINE>It is not Caesar's natural vice to hate</LINE>
<LINE>Our great competitor: from Alexandria</LINE>
<LINE>This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes</LINE>
<LINE>The lamps of night in revel; is not more man-like</LINE>
<LINE>Than Cleopatra; nor the queen of Ptolemy</LINE>
<LINE>More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or</LINE>
<LINE>Vouchsafed to think he had partners: you shall find there</LINE>
<LINE>A man who is the abstract of all faults</LINE>
<LINE>That all men follow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I must not think there are</LINE>
<LINE>Evils enow to darken all his goodness:</LINE>
<LINE>His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>More fiery by night's blackness; hereditary,</LINE>
<LINE>Rather than purchased; what he cannot change,</LINE>
<LINE>Than what he chooses.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are too indulgent. Let us grant, it is not</LINE>
<LINE>Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy;</LINE>
<LINE>To give a kingdom for a mirth; to sit</LINE>
<LINE>And keep the turn of tippling with a slave;</LINE>
<LINE>To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet</LINE>
<LINE>With knaves that smell of sweat: say this</LINE>
<LINE>becomes him,--</LINE>
<LINE>As his composure must be rare indeed</LINE>
<LINE>Whom these things cannot blemish,--yet must Antony</LINE>
<LINE>No way excuse his soils, when we do bear</LINE>
<LINE>So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd</LINE>
<LINE>His vacancy with his voluptuousness,</LINE>
<LINE>Full surfeits, and the dryness of his bones,</LINE>
<LINE>Call on him for't: but to confound such time,</LINE>
<LINE>That drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud</LINE>
<LINE>As his own state and ours,--'tis to be chid</LINE>
<LINE>As we rate boys, who, being mature in knowledge,</LINE>
<LINE>Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,</LINE>
<LINE>And so rebel to judgment.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter a Messenger</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here's more news.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thy biddings have been done; and every hour,</LINE>
<LINE>Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report</LINE>
<LINE>How 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea;</LINE>
<LINE>And it appears he is beloved of those</LINE>
<LINE>That only have fear'd Caesar: to the ports</LINE>
<LINE>The discontents repair, and men's reports</LINE>
<LINE>Give him much wrong'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I should have known no less.</LINE>
<LINE>It hath been taught us from the primal state,</LINE>
<LINE>That he which is was wish'd until he were;</LINE>
<LINE>And the ebb'd man, ne'er loved till ne'er worth love,</LINE>
<LINE>Comes dear'd by being lack'd. This common body,</LINE>
<LINE>Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,</LINE>
<LINE>Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,</LINE>
<LINE>To rot itself with motion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Caesar, I bring thee word,</LINE>
<LINE>Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,</LINE>
<LINE>Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound</LINE>
<LINE>With keels of every kind: many hot inroads</LINE>
<LINE>They make in Italy; the borders maritime</LINE>
<LINE>Lack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt:</LINE>
<LINE>No vessel can peep forth, but 'tis as soon</LINE>
<LINE>Taken as seen; for Pompey's name strikes more</LINE>
<LINE>Than could his war resisted.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Antony,</LINE>
<LINE>Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once</LINE>
<LINE>Wast beaten from Modena, where thou slew'st</LINE>
<LINE>Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel</LINE>
<LINE>Did famine follow; whom thou fought'st against,</LINE>
<LINE>Though daintily brought up, with patience more</LINE>
<LINE>Than savages could suffer: thou didst drink</LINE>
<LINE>The stale of horses, and the gilded puddle</LINE>
<LINE>Which beasts would cough at: thy palate then did deign</LINE>
<LINE>The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;</LINE>
<LINE>Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,</LINE>
<LINE>The barks of trees thou browsed'st; on the Alps</LINE>
<LINE>It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,</LINE>
<LINE>Which some did die to look on: and all this--</LINE>
<LINE>It wounds thine honour that I speak it now--</LINE>
<LINE>Was borne so like a soldier, that thy cheek</LINE>
<LINE>So much as lank'd not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis pity of him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let his shames quickly</LINE>
<LINE>Drive him to Rome: 'tis time we twain</LINE>
<LINE>Did show ourselves i' the field; and to that end</LINE>
<LINE>Assemble we immediate council: Pompey</LINE>
<LINE>Thrives in our idleness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To-morrow, Caesar,</LINE>
<LINE>I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly</LINE>
<LINE>Both what by sea and land I can be able</LINE>
<LINE>To front this present time.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Till which encounter,</LINE>
<LINE>It is my business too. Farewell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Farewell, my lord: what you shall know meantime</LINE>
<LINE>Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>To let me be partaker.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Thou, eunuch Mardian!</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARDIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's your highness' pleasure?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasure</LINE>
<LINE>In aught an eunuch has: 'tis well for thee,</LINE>
<LINE>That, being unseminar'd, thy freer thoughts</LINE>
<LINE>May not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARDIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, gracious madam.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARDIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not in deed, madam; for I can do nothing</LINE>
<LINE>But what indeed is honest to be done:</LINE>
<LINE>Yet have I fierce affections, and think</LINE>
<LINE>What Venus did with Mars.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Charmian,</LINE>
<LINE>Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he?</LINE>
<LINE>Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?</LINE>
<LINE>O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!</LINE>
<LINE>Do bravely, horse! for wot'st thou whom thou movest?</LINE>
<LINE>The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm</LINE>
<LINE>And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,</LINE>
<LINE>Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'</LINE>
<LINE>For so he calls me: now I feed myself</LINE>
<LINE>With most delicious poison. Think on me,</LINE>
<LINE>That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,</LINE>
<LINE>And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,</LINE>
<LINE>When thou wast here above the ground, I was</LINE>
<LINE>A morsel for a monarch: and great Pompey</LINE>
<LINE>Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;</LINE>
<LINE>There would he anchor his aspect and die</LINE>
<LINE>With looking on his life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter ALEXAS, from OCTAVIUS CAESAR</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALEXAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sovereign of Egypt, hail!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!</LINE>
<LINE>Yet, coming from him, that great medicine hath</LINE>
<LINE>With his tinct gilded thee.</LINE>
<LINE>How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALEXAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Last thing he did, dear queen,</LINE>
<LINE>He kiss'd,--the last of many doubled kisses,--</LINE>
<LINE>This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mine ear must pluck it thence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALEXAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Good friend,' quoth he,</LINE>
<LINE>'Say, the firm Roman to great Egypt sends</LINE>
<LINE>This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,</LINE>
<LINE>To mend the petty present, I will piece</LINE>
<LINE>Her opulent throne with kingdoms; all the east,</LINE>
<LINE>Say thou, shall call her mistress.' So he nodded,</LINE>
<LINE>And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,</LINE>
<LINE>Who neigh'd so high, that what I would have spoke</LINE>
<LINE>Was beastly dumb'd by him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, was he sad or merry?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALEXAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Like to the time o' the year between the extremes</LINE>
<LINE>Of hot and cold, he was nor sad nor merry.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O well-divided disposition! Note him,</LINE>
<LINE>Note him good Charmian, 'tis the man; but note him:</LINE>
<LINE>He was not sad, for he would shine on those</LINE>
<LINE>That make their looks by his; he was not merry,</LINE>
<LINE>Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay</LINE>
<LINE>In Egypt with his joy; but between both:</LINE>
<LINE>O heavenly mingle! Be'st thou sad or merry,</LINE>
<LINE>The violence of either thee becomes,</LINE>
<LINE>So does it no man else. Met'st thou my posts?</LINE>

<LINE>Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENECRATES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We, ignorant of ourselves,</LINE>
<LINE>Beg often our own harms, which the wise powers</LINE>
<LINE>Deny us for our good; so find we profit</LINE>
<LINE>By losing of our prayers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I shall do well:</LINE>
<LINE>The people love me, and the sea is mine;</LINE>
<LINE>My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope</LINE>
<LINE>Says it will come to the full. Mark Antony</LINE>
<LINE>In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make</LINE>
<LINE>No wars without doors: Caesar gets money where</LINE>
<LINE>He loses hearts: Lepidus flatters both,</LINE>
<LINE>Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor either cares for him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>He dreams: I know they are in Rome together,</LINE>
<LINE>Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,</LINE>
<LINE>Salt Cleopatra, soften thy waned lip!</LINE>
<LINE>Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both!</LINE>
<LINE>Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,</LINE>
<LINE>Keep his brain fuming; Epicurean cooks</LINE>
<LINE>Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite;</LINE>
<LINE>That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour</LINE>
<LINE>Even till a Lethe'd dulness!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter VARRIUS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How now, Varrius!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VARRIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is most certain that I shall deliver:</LINE>
<LINE>Mark Antony is every hour in Rome</LINE>
<LINE>Expected: since he went from Egypt 'tis</LINE>
<LINE>A space for further travel.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I could have given less matter</LINE>
<LINE>A better ear. Menas, I did not think</LINE>
<LINE>This amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm</LINE>
<LINE>For such a petty war: his soldiership</LINE>
<LINE>Is twice the other twain: but let us rear</LINE>
<LINE>The higher our opinion, that our stirring</LINE>
<LINE>Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck</LINE>
<LINE>The ne'er-lust-wearied Antony.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot hope</LINE>
<LINE>Caesar and Antony shall well greet together:</LINE>
<LINE>His wife that's dead did trespasses to Caesar;</LINE>
<LINE>His brother warr'd upon him; although, I think,</LINE>
<LINE>Not moved by Antony.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know not, Menas,</LINE>
<LINE>How lesser enmities may give way to greater.</LINE>
<LINE>Were't not that we stand up against them all,</LINE>
<LINE>'Twere pregnant they should square between</LINE>
<LINE>themselves;</LINE>
<LINE>For they have entertained cause enough</LINE>
<LINE>To draw their swords: but how the fear of us</LINE>
<LINE>May cement their divisions and bind up</LINE>
<LINE>The petty difference, we yet not know.</LINE>
<LINE>Be't as our gods will have't! It only stands</LINE>
<LINE>Our lives upon to use our strongest hands.</LINE>

<LINE>Good Enobarbus, 'tis a worthy deed,</LINE>

<LINE>To soft and gentle speech.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I shall entreat him</LINE>
<LINE>To answer like himself: if Caesar move him,</LINE>
<LINE>Let Antony look over Caesar's head</LINE>
<LINE>And speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter,</LINE>
<LINE>Were I the wearer of Antonius' beard,</LINE>
<LINE>I would not shave't to-day.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Every time</LINE>

<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Noble friends,</LINE>
<LINE>That which combined us was most great, and let not</LINE>
<LINE>A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,</LINE>
<LINE>May it be gently heard: when we debate</LINE>
<LINE>Our trivial difference loud, we do commit</LINE>
<LINE>Murder in healing wounds: then, noble partners,</LINE>
<LINE>The rather, for I earnestly beseech,</LINE>
<LINE>Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor curstness grow to the matter.</LINE>

<LINE>Nay, then.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I learn, you take things ill which are not so,</LINE>
<LINE>Or being, concern you not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I must be laugh'd at,</LINE>
<LINE>If, or for nothing or a little, I</LINE>
<LINE>Should say myself offended, and with you</LINE>
<LINE>Chiefly i' the world; more laugh'd at, that I should</LINE>
<LINE>Once name you derogately, when to sound your name</LINE>
<LINE>It not concern'd me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My being in Egypt, Caesar,</LINE>
<LINE>What was't to you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No more than my residing here at Rome</LINE>
<LINE>Might be to you in Egypt: yet, if you there</LINE>
<LINE>Did practise on my state, your being in Egypt</LINE>
<LINE>Might be my question.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How intend you, practised?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You may be pleased to catch at mine intent</LINE>
<LINE>By what did here befal me. Your wife and brother</LINE>
<LINE>Made wars upon me; and their contestation</LINE>
<LINE>Was theme for you, you were the word of war.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You do mistake your business; my brother never</LINE>
<LINE>Did urge me in his act: I did inquire it;</LINE>
<LINE>And have my learning from some true reports,</LINE>
<LINE>That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather</LINE>
<LINE>Discredit my authority with yours;</LINE>
<LINE>And make the wars alike against my stomach,</LINE>
<LINE>Having alike your cause? Of this my letters</LINE>
<LINE>Before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel,</LINE>
<LINE>As matter whole you have not to make it with,</LINE>
<LINE>It must not be with this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You praise yourself</LINE>
<LINE>By laying defects of judgment to me; but</LINE>
<LINE>You patch'd up your excuses.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not so, not so;</LINE>
<LINE>I know you could not lack, I am certain on't,</LINE>
<LINE>Very necessity of this thought, that I,</LINE>
<LINE>Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought,</LINE>
<LINE>Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars</LINE>
<LINE>Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,</LINE>
<LINE>I would you had her spirit in such another:</LINE>
<LINE>The third o' the world is yours; which with a snaffle</LINE>
<LINE>You may pace easy, but not such a wife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Would we had all such wives, that the men might go</LINE>
<LINE>to wars with the women!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar</LINE>
<LINE>Made out of her impatience, which not wanted</LINE>
<LINE>Shrewdness of policy too, I grieving grant</LINE>
<LINE>Did you too much disquiet: for that you must</LINE>
<LINE>But say, I could not help it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I wrote to you</LINE>
<LINE>When rioting in Alexandria; you</LINE>
<LINE>Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts</LINE>
<LINE>Did gibe my missive out of audience.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir,</LINE>
<LINE>He fell upon me ere admitted: then</LINE>
<LINE>Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want</LINE>
<LINE>Of what I was i' the morning: but next day</LINE>
<LINE>I told him of myself; which was as much</LINE>
<LINE>As to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellow</LINE>
<LINE>Be nothing of our strife; if we contend,</LINE>
<LINE>Out of our question wipe him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have broken</LINE>
<LINE>The article of your oath; which you shall never</LINE>
<LINE>Have tongue to charge me with.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Soft, Caesar!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No,</LINE>
<LINE>Lepidus, let him speak:</LINE>
<LINE>The honour is sacred which he talks on now,</LINE>
<LINE>Supposing that I lack'd it. But, on, Caesar;</LINE>
<LINE>The article of my oath.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To lend me arms and aid when I required them;</LINE>
<LINE>The which you both denied.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Neglected, rather;</LINE>
<LINE>And then when poison'd hours had bound me up</LINE>
<LINE>From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll play the penitent to you: but mine honesty</LINE>
<LINE>Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power</LINE>
<LINE>Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia,</LINE>
<LINE>To have me out of Egypt, made wars here;</LINE>
<LINE>For which myself, the ignorant motive, do</LINE>
<LINE>So far ask pardon as befits mine honour</LINE>
<LINE>To stoop in such a case.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis noble spoken.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MECAENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If it might please you, to enforce no further</LINE>
<LINE>The griefs between ye: to forget them quite</LINE>
<LINE>Were to remember that the present need</LINE>
<LINE>Speaks to atone you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Worthily spoken, Mecaenas.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Or, if you borrow one another's love for the</LINE>
<LINE>instant, you may, when you hear no more words of</LINE>
<LINE>Pompey, return it again: you shall have time to</LINE>
<LINE>wrangle in when you have nothing else to do.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou art a soldier only: speak no more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go to, then; your considerate stone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not much dislike the matter, but</LINE>
<LINE>The manner of his speech; for't cannot be</LINE>
<LINE>We shall remain in friendship, our conditions</LINE>
<LINE>So differing in their acts. Yet if I knew</LINE>
<LINE>What hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edge</LINE>
<LINE>O' the world I would pursue it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AGRIPPA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me leave, Caesar,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Speak, Agrippa.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AGRIPPA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,</LINE>
<LINE>Admired Octavia: great Mark Antony</LINE>
<LINE>Is now a widower.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say not so, Agrippa:</LINE>
<LINE>If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof</LINE>
<LINE>Were well deserved of rashness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am not married, Caesar: let me hear</LINE>
<LINE>Agrippa further speak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AGRIPPA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To hold you in perpetual amity,</LINE>
<LINE>To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts</LINE>
<LINE>With an unslipping knot, take Antony</LINE>
<LINE>Octavia to his wife; whose beauty claims</LINE>
<LINE>No worse a husband than the best of men;</LINE>
<LINE>Whose virtue and whose general graces speak</LINE>
<LINE>That which none else can utter. By this marriage,</LINE>
<LINE>All little jealousies, which now seem great,</LINE>
<LINE>And all great fears, which now import their dangers,</LINE>
<LINE>Would then be nothing: truths would be tales,</LINE>
<LINE>Where now half tales be truths: her love to both</LINE>
<LINE>Would, each to other and all loves to both,</LINE>
<LINE>Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;</LINE>
<LINE>For 'tis a studied, not a present thought,</LINE>
<LINE>By duty ruminated.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will Caesar speak?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey;</LINE>

<LINE>Lest my remembrance suffer ill report;</LINE>
<LINE>At heel of that, defy him.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance, and</LINE>

<SPEAKER>MECAENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Eight wild-boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and</LINE>

<LINE>She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to</LINE>
<LINE>her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When she first met Mark Antony, she pursed up</LINE>
<LINE>his heart, upon the river of Cydnus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AGRIPPA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There she appeared indeed; or my reporter devised</LINE>
<LINE>well for her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will tell you.</LINE>
<LINE>The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,</LINE>
<LINE>Burn'd on the water: the poop was beaten gold;</LINE>
<LINE>Purple the sails, and so perfumed that</LINE>
<LINE>The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,</LINE>
<LINE>Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made</LINE>
<LINE>The water which they beat to follow faster,</LINE>
<LINE>As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,</LINE>
<LINE>It beggar'd all description: she did lie</LINE>
<LINE>In her pavilion--cloth-of-gold of tissue--</LINE>
<LINE>O'er-picturing that Venus where we see</LINE>
<LINE>The fancy outwork nature: on each side her</LINE>
<LINE>Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,</LINE>
<LINE>With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem</LINE>

<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,</LINE>
<LINE>So many mermaids, tended her i' the eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>And made their bends adornings: at the helm</LINE>
<LINE>A seeming mermaid steers: the silken tackle</LINE>
<LINE>Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands,</LINE>
<LINE>That yarely frame the office. From the barge</LINE>
<LINE>A strange invisible perfume hits the sense</LINE>
<LINE>Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast</LINE>
<LINE>Her people out upon her; and Antony,</LINE>
<LINE>Enthroned i' the market-place, did sit alone,</LINE>
<LINE>Whistling to the air; which, but for vacancy,</LINE>
<LINE>Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,</LINE>
<LINE>And made a gap in nature.</LINE>

<LINE>Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,</LINE>
<LINE>Invited her to supper: she replied,</LINE>
<LINE>It should be better he became her guest;</LINE>
<LINE>Which she entreated: our courteous Antony,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,</LINE>
<LINE>Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast,</LINE>
<LINE>And for his ordinary pays his heart</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I saw her once</LINE>
<LINE>Hop forty paces through the public street;</LINE>

<SPEAKER>MECAENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now Antony must leave her utterly.</LINE>

<LINE>Never; he will not:</LINE>
<LINE>Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale</LINE>
<LINE>Her infinite variety: other women cloy</LINE>
<LINE>The appetites they feed: but she makes hungry</LINE>
<LINE>Where most she satisfies; for vilest things</LINE>
<LINE>Become themselves in her: that the holy priests</LINE>
<LINE>Bless her when she is riggish.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Rid all the sea of pirates; then, to send</LINE>
<LINE>Measures of wheat to Rome; this 'greed upon</LINE>
<LINE>To part with unhack'd edges, and bear back</LINE>
<LINE>Our targes undinted.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That's our offer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Know, then,</LINE>
<LINE>I came before you here a man prepared</LINE>
<LINE>To take this offer: but Mark Antony</LINE>
<LINE>Put me to some impatience: though I lose</LINE>
<LINE>The praise of it by telling, you must know,</LINE>
<LINE>When Caesar and your brother were at blows,</LINE>
<LINE>Your mother came to Sicily and did find</LINE>
<LINE>Her welcome friendly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have heard it, Pompey;</LINE>
<LINE>And am well studied for a liberal thanks</LINE>
<LINE>Which I do owe you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let me have your hand:</LINE>
<LINE>I did not think, sir, to have met you here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The beds i' the east are soft; and thanks to you,</LINE>
<LINE>That call'd me timelier than my purpose hither;</LINE>
<LINE>For I have gain'd by 't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Since I saw you last,</LINE>
<LINE>There is a change upon you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, I know not</LINE>
<LINE>What counts harsh fortune casts upon my face;</LINE>
<LINE>But in my bosom shall she never come,</LINE>
<LINE>To make my heart her vassal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well met here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed:</LINE>
<LINE>I crave our composition may be written,</LINE>
<LINE>And seal'd between us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That's the next to do.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We'll feast each other ere we part; and let's</LINE>
<LINE>Draw lots who shall begin.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That will I, Pompey.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, Antony, take the lot: but, first</LINE>
<LINE>Or last, your fine Egyptian cookery</LINE>
<LINE>Shall have the fame. I have heard that Julius Caesar</LINE>
<LINE>Grew fat with feasting there.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have heard much.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have fair meanings, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And fair words to them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then so much have I heard:</LINE>
<LINE>And I have heard, Apollodorus carried--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No more of that: he did so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, I pray you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know thee now: how farest thou, soldier?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well;</LINE>
<LINE>And well am like to do; for, I perceive,</LINE>
<LINE>Four feasts are toward.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let me shake thy hand;</LINE>
<LINE>I never hated thee: I have seen thee fight,</LINE>
<LINE>When I have envied thy behavior.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir,</LINE>
<LINE>I never loved you much; but I ha' praised ye,</LINE>
<LINE>When you have well deserved ten times as much</LINE>
<LINE>As I have said you did.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Enjoy thy plainness,</LINE>
<LINE>It nothing ill becomes thee.</LINE>
<LINE>Aboard my galley I invite you all:</LINE>
<LINE>Will you lead, lords?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Show us the way, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exeunt all but MENAS and ENOBARBUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  Thy father, Pompey, would ne'er have</LINE>
<LINE>made this treaty.--You and I have known, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>At sea, I think.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We have, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have done well by water.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And you by land.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will praise any man that will praise me; though it</LINE>
<LINE>cannot be denied what I have done by land.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nor what I have done by water.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, something you can deny for your own</LINE>
<LINE>safety: you have been a great thief by sea.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And you by land.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There I deny my land service. But give me your</LINE>
<LINE>hand, Menas: if our eyes had authority, here they</LINE>
<LINE>might take two thieves kissing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But there is never a fair woman has a true face.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No slander; they steal hearts.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We came hither to fight with you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking.</LINE>
<LINE>Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If he do, sure, he cannot weep't back again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You've said, sir. We looked not for Mark Antony</LINE>
<LINE>here: pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Caesar's sister is called Octavia.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pray ye, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis true.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would</LINE>
<LINE>not prophesy so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think the policy of that purpose made more in the</LINE>
<LINE>marriage than the love of the parties.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think so too. But you shall find, the band that</LINE>
<LINE>seems to tie their friendship together will be the</LINE>
<LINE>very strangler of their amity: Octavia is of a</LINE>
<LINE>holy, cold, and still conversation.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who would not have his wife so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony.</LINE>
<LINE>He will to his Egyptian dish again: then shall the</LINE>
<LINE>sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar; and, as</LINE>
<LINE>I said before, that which is the strength of their</LINE>
<LINE>amity shall prove the immediate author of their</LINE>
<LINE>variance. Antony will use his affection where it is:</LINE>
<LINE>he married but his occasion here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard?</LINE>
<LINE>I have a health for you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I shall take it, sir: we have used our throats in Egypt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, let's away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exeunt</STAGEDIR>
</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE VII.  On board POMPEY's galley, off Misenum.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Music plays. Enter two or three Servants with
a banquet</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Servant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here they'll be, man. Some o' their plants are</LINE>
<LINE>ill-rooted already: the least wind i' the world</LINE>
<LINE>will blow them down.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Servant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lepidus is high-coloured.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Servant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They have made him drink alms-drink.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Servant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As they pinch one another by the disposition, he</LINE>
<LINE>cries out 'No more;' reconciles them to his</LINE>
<LINE>entreaty, and himself to the drink.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Servant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But it raises the greater war between him and</LINE>
<LINE>his discretion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Servant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, this is to have a name in great men's</LINE>
<LINE>fellowship: I had as lief have a reed that will do</LINE>
<LINE>me no service as a partisan I could not heave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Servant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To be called into a huge sphere, and not to be seen</LINE>
<LINE>to move in't, are the holes where eyes should be,</LINE>
<LINE>which pitifully disaster the cheeks.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>A sennet sounded. Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK
ANTONY, LEPIDUS, POMPEY, AGRIPPA, MECAENAS,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, MENAS, with other captains</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>To OCTAVIUS CAESAR</STAGEDIR>  Thus do they, sir: they take</LINE>
<LINE>the flow o' the Nile</LINE>
<LINE>By certain scales i' the pyramid; they know,</LINE>
<LINE>By the height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth</LINE>
<LINE>Or foison follow: the higher Nilus swells,</LINE>
<LINE>The more it promises: as it ebbs, the seedsman</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,</LINE>
<LINE>And shortly comes to harvest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You've strange serpents there.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, Lepidus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the</LINE>
<LINE>operation of your sun: so is your crocodile.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They are so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sit,--and some wine! A health to Lepidus!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am not so well as I should be, but I'll ne'er out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not till you have slept; I fear me you'll be in till then.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies'</LINE>
<LINE>pyramises are very goodly things; without</LINE>
<LINE>contradiction, I have heard that.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside to POMPEY</STAGEDIR>  Pompey, a word.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside to MENAS</STAGEDIR>                 Say in mine ear:</LINE>
<LINE>what is't?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside to POMPEY</STAGEDIR>  Forsake thy seat, I do beseech</LINE>
<LINE>thee, captain,</LINE>
<LINE>And hear me speak a word.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside to MENAS</STAGEDIR>  Forbear me till anon.</LINE>
<LINE>This wine for Lepidus!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What manner o' thing is your crocodile?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is shaped, sir, like itself; and it is as broad</LINE>
<LINE>as it hath breadth: it is just so high as it is,</LINE>
<LINE>and moves with its own organs: it lives by that</LINE>
<LINE>which nourisheth it; and the elements once out of</LINE>
<LINE>it, it transmigrates.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What colour is it of?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of it own colour too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis a strange serpent.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis so. And the tears of it are wet.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will this description satisfy him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a</LINE>
<LINE>very epicure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside to MENAS</STAGEDIR>  Go hang, sir, hang! Tell me of</LINE>
<LINE>that? away!</LINE>
<LINE>Do as I bid you. Where's this cup I call'd for?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside to POMPEY</STAGEDIR>  If for the sake of merit thou</LINE>
<LINE>wilt hear me,</LINE>
<LINE>Rise from thy stool.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside to MENAS</STAGEDIR>  I think thou'rt mad.</LINE>
<LINE>The matter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Rises, and walks aside</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou hast served me with much faith. What's else to say?</LINE>
<LINE>Be jolly, lords.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These quick-sands, Lepidus,</LINE>
<LINE>Keep off them, for you sink.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wilt thou be lord of all the world?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What say'st thou?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How should that be?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But entertain it,</LINE>
<LINE>And, though thou think me poor, I am the man</LINE>
<LINE>Will give thee all the world.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hast thou drunk well?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art, if thou darest be, the earthly Jove:</LINE>
<LINE>Whate'er the ocean pales, or sky inclips,</LINE>
<LINE>Is thine, if thou wilt ha't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Show me which way.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These three world-sharers, these competitors,</LINE>
<LINE>Are in thy vessel: let me cut the cable;</LINE>
<LINE>And, when we are put off, fall to their throats:</LINE>
<LINE>All there is thine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, this thou shouldst have done,</LINE>
<LINE>And not have spoke on't! In me 'tis villany;</LINE>
<LINE>In thee't had been good service. Thou must know,</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour;</LINE>
<LINE>Mine honour, it. Repent that e'er thy tongue</LINE>
<LINE>Hath so betray'd thine act: being done unknown,</LINE>
<LINE>I should have found it afterwards well done;</LINE>
<LINE>But must condemn it now. Desist, and drink.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  For this,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more.</LINE>
<LINE>Who seeks, and will not take when once 'tis offer'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall never find it more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This health to Lepidus!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A' bears the third part of the world, man; see'st</LINE>
<LINE>not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The third part, then, is drunk: would it were all,</LINE>
<LINE>That it might go on wheels!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Drink thou; increase the reels.</LINE>

<LINE>It ripens towards it. Strike the vessels, ho?</LINE>
<LINE>Here is to Caesar!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I could well forbear't.</LINE>
<LINE>It's monstrous labour, when I wash my brain,</LINE>
<LINE>And it grows fouler.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be a child o' the time.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Possess it, I'll make answer:</LINE>

<LINE>Than drink so much in one.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ha, my brave emperor!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To MARK ANTONY</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals,</LINE>
<LINE>And celebrate our drink?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let's ha't, good soldier.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, let's all take hands,</LINE>
<LINE>Till that the conquering wine hath steep'd our sense</LINE>
<LINE>In soft and delicate Lethe.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All take hands.</LINE>
<LINE>Make battery to our ears with the loud music:</LINE>
<LINE>The while I'll place you: then the boy shall sing;</LINE>
<LINE>The holding every man shall bear as loud</LINE>
<LINE>As his strong sides can volley.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Music plays. DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS places them
hand in hand</STAGEDIR>
<SUBHEAD>THE SONG.</SUBHEAD>
<LINE>Come, thou monarch of the vine,</LINE>
<LINE>Plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne!</LINE>
<LINE>In thy fats our cares be drown'd,</LINE>
<LINE>With thy grapes our hairs be crown'd:</LINE>
<LINE>Cup us, till the world go round,</LINE>
<LINE>Cup us, till the world go round!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What would you more? Pompey, good night. Good brother,</LINE>
<LINE>Let me request you off: our graver business</LINE>
<LINE>Frowns at this levity. Gentle lords, let's part;</LINE>
<LINE>You see we have burnt our cheeks: strong Enobarb</LINE>
<LINE>Is weaker than the wine; and mine own tongue</LINE>
<LINE>Splits what it speaks: the wild disguise hath almost</LINE>
<LINE>Antick'd us all. What needs more words? Good night.</LINE>
<LINE>Good Antony, your hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Noble Ventidius,</LINE>
<LINE>Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm,</LINE>
<LINE>The fugitive Parthians follow; spur through Media,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>VENTIDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Silius, Silius,</LINE>
<LINE>I have done enough; a lower place, note well,</LINE>

<LINE>Better to leave undone, than by our deed</LINE>
<LINE>Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away.</LINE>
<LINE>Caesar and Antony have ever won</LINE>
<LINE>More in their officer than person: Sossius,</LINE>
<LINE>One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,</LINE>
<LINE>For quick accumulation of renown,</LINE>
<LINE>Which he achieved by the minute, lost his favour.</LINE>
<LINE>Who does i' the wars more than his captain can</LINE>
<LINE>Becomes his captain's captain: and ambition,</LINE>
<LINE>The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss,</LINE>
<LINE>Than gain which darkens him.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Caesar: and that, having in Sicily</LINE>
<LINE>Sextus Pompeius spoil'd, we had not rated him</LINE>
<LINE>His part o' the isle: then does he say, he lent me</LINE>
<LINE>Some shipping unrestored: lastly, he frets</LINE>

<LINE>All his revenue.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AGRIPPA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, this should be answer'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis done already, and the messenger gone.</LINE>
<LINE>I have told him, Lepidus was grown too cruel;</LINE>
<LINE>That he his high authority abused,</LINE>
<LINE>And did deserve his change: for what I have conquer'd,</LINE>
<LINE>I grant him part; but then, in his Armenia,</LINE>
<LINE>And other of his conquer'd kingdoms, I</LINE>
<LINE>Demand the like.</LINE>

<LINE>Why have you stol'n upon us thus! You come not</LINE>
<LINE>Like Caesar's sister: the wife of Antony</LINE>
<LINE>Should have an army for an usher, and</LINE>
<LINE>The neighs of horse to tell of her approach</LINE>
<LINE>Long ere she did appear; the trees by the way</LINE>
<LINE>Should have borne men; and expectation fainted,</LINE>
<LINE>Longing for what it had not; nay, the dust</LINE>
<LINE>Should have ascended to the roof of heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>Raised by your populous troops: but you are come</LINE>
<LINE>A market-maid to Rome; and have prevented</LINE>
<LINE>The ostentation of our love, which, left unshown,</LINE>
<LINE>Is often left unloved; we should have met you</LINE>
<LINE>By sea and land; supplying every stage</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>To come thus was I not constrain'd, but did</LINE>
<LINE>On my free will. My lord, Mark Antony,</LINE>
<LINE>Hearing that you prepared for war, acquainted</LINE>

<LINE>His pardon for return.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>O'er your content these strong necessities;</LINE>
<LINE>But let determined things to destiny</LINE>
<LINE>Hold unbewail'd their way. Welcome to Rome;</LINE>
<LINE>Nothing more dear to me. You are abused</LINE>

<LINE>Is it not strange, Canidius,</LINE>

<LINE>Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your ships are not well mann'd;</LINE>

<LINE>His sword e'en like a dancer; while I struck</LINE>
<LINE>The lean and wrinkled Cassius; and 'twas I</LINE>
<LINE>That the mad Brutus ended: he alone</LINE>

<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Egypt, thou knew'st too well</LINE>

<LINE>And palter in the shifts of lowness; who</LINE>
<LINE>With half the bulk o' the world play'd as I pleased,</LINE>
<LINE>Making and marring fortunes. You did know</LINE>

<LINE>Unstate his happiness, and be staged to the show,</LINE>
<LINE>Against a sworder! I see men's judgments are</LINE>
<LINE>A parcel of their fortunes; and things outward</LINE>
<LINE>Do draw the inward quality after them,</LINE>
<LINE>To suffer all alike. That he should dream,</LINE>
<LINE>Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will</LINE>
<LINE>Answer his emptiness! Caesar, thou hast subdued</LINE>

<LINE>Shall I say to Caesar</LINE>
<LINE>What you require of him? for he partly begs</LINE>
<LINE>To be desired to give. It much would please him,</LINE>
<LINE>That of his fortunes you should make a staff</LINE>
<LINE>To lean upon: but it would warm his spirits,</LINE>

<LINE>Be comforted, dear madam.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, I will not:</LINE>
<LINE>All strange and terrible events are welcome,</LINE>
<LINE>But comforts we despise; our size of sorrow,</LINE>
<LINE>Proportion'd to our cause, must be as great</LINE>

<LINE>How now! is he dead?</LINE>

<LINE>Antony, Antony! Help, Charmian, help, Iras, help;</LINE>
<LINE>Help, friends below; let's draw him hither.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I dare not, dear,--</LINE>
<LINE>Dear my lord, pardon,--I dare not,</LINE>
<LINE>Lest I be taken: not the imperious show</LINE>
<LINE>Of the full-fortuned Caesar ever shall</LINE>
<LINE>Be brooch'd with me; if knife, drugs,</LINE>
<LINE>serpents, have</LINE>
<LINE>Edge, sting, or operation, I am safe:</LINE>
<LINE>Your wife Octavia, with her modest eyes</LINE>
<LINE>And still conclusion, shall acquire no honour</LINE>
<LINE>Demuring upon me. But come, come, Antony,--</LINE>
<LINE>Help me, my women,--we must draw thee up:</LINE>

<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here's sport indeed! How heavy weighs my lord!</LINE>
<LINE>Our strength is all gone into heaviness,</LINE>
<LINE>That makes the weight: had I great Juno's power,</LINE>
<LINE>The strong-wing'd Mercury should fetch thee up,</LINE>
<LINE>And set thee by Jove's side. Yet come a little,--</LINE>
<LINE>Wishes were ever fools,--O, come, come, come;</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>They heave MARK ANTONY aloft to CLEOPATRA</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>And welcome, welcome! die where thou hast lived:</LINE>
<LINE>Quicken with kissing: had my lips that power,</LINE>
<LINE>Thus would I wear them out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>All</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A heavy sight!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>I am dying, Egypt, dying:</LINE>
<LINE>Give me some wine, and let me speak a little.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, let me speak; and let me rail so high,</LINE>
<LINE>That the false housewife Fortune break her wheel,</LINE>

<LINE>The noblest; and do now not basely die,</LINE>
<LINE>Not cowardly put off my helmet to</LINE>
<LINE>My countryman,--a Roman by a Roman</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>MARK ANTONY dies</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>The crown o' the earth doth melt. My lord!</LINE>
<LINE>O, wither'd is the garland of the war,</LINE>
<LINE>The soldier's pole is fall'n: young boys and girls</LINE>

<LINE>To tell them that this world did equal theirs</LINE>
<LINE>Till they had stol'n our jewel. All's but naught;</LINE>
<LINE>Patience is scottish, and impatience does</LINE>
<LINE>Become a dog that's mad: then is it sin</LINE>

<LINE>Let's do it after the high Roman fashion,</LINE>

<LINE>Wherefore is that? and what art thou that darest</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DERCETAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am call'd Dercetas;</LINE>
<LINE>Mark Antony I served, who best was worthy</LINE>
<LINE>Best to be served: whilst he stood up and spoke,</LINE>
<LINE>He was my master; and I wore my life</LINE>
<LINE>To spend upon his haters. If thou please</LINE>
<LINE>To take me to thee, as I was to him</LINE>
<LINE>I'll be to Caesar; if thou pleasest not,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is't thou say'st?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DERCETAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The breaking of so great a thing should make</LINE>
<LINE>A greater crack: the round world</LINE>
<LINE>Should have shook lions into civil streets,</LINE>
<LINE>And citizens to their dens: the death of Antony</LINE>
<LINE>Is not a single doom; in the name lay</LINE>
<LINE>A moiety of the world.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DERCETAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is dead, Caesar:</LINE>
<LINE>Not by a public minister of justice,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor by a hired knife; but that self hand,</LINE>
<LINE>Which writ his honour in the acts it did,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,</LINE>
<LINE>Splitted the heart. This is his sword;</LINE>
<LINE>I robb'd his wound of it; behold it stain'd</LINE>
<LINE>With his most noble blood.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Look you sad, friends?</LINE>
<LINE>The gods rebuke me, but it is tidings</LINE>
<LINE>To wash the eyes of kings.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AGRIPPA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And strange it is,</LINE>
<LINE>That nature must compel us to lament</LINE>
<LINE>Our most persisted deeds.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>MECAENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His taints and honours</LINE>
<LINE>Waged equal with him.</LINE>

<LINE>A rarer spirit never</LINE>
<LINE>Did steer humanity: but you, gods, will give us</LINE>
<LINE>Some faults to make us men. Caesar is touch'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MECAENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When such a spacious mirror's set before him,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Antony!</LINE>
<LINE>I have follow'd thee to this; but we do lance</LINE>
<LINE>Diseases in our bodies: I must perforce</LINE>
<LINE>Have shown to thee such a declining day,</LINE>
<LINE>Or look on thine; we could not stall together</LINE>
<LINE>In the whole world: but yet let me lament,</LINE>
<LINE>With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts,</LINE>
<LINE>That thou, my brother, my competitor</LINE>
<LINE>In top of all design, my mate in empire,</LINE>
<LINE>Friend and companion in the front of war,</LINE>
<LINE>The arm of mine own body, and the heart</LINE>
<LINE>Where mine his thoughts did kindle,--that our stars,</LINE>
<LINE>Unreconciliable, should divide</LINE>
<LINE>Our equalness to this. Hear me, good friends--</LINE>
<LINE>But I will tell you at some meeter season:</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter an Egyptian</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>The business of this man looks out of him;</LINE>
<LINE>We'll hear him what he says. Whence are you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Egyptian</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A poor Egyptian yet. The queen my mistress,</LINE>
<LINE>Confined in all she has, her monument,</LINE>
<LINE>Of thy intents desires instruction,</LINE>
<LINE>That she preparedly may frame herself</LINE>
<LINE>To the way she's forced to.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bid her have good heart:</LINE>
<LINE>She soon shall know of us, by some of ours,</LINE>
<LINE>How honourable and how kindly we</LINE>
<LINE>Determine for her; for Caesar cannot live</LINE>
<LINE>To be ungentle.</LINE>

<LINE>Come hither, Proculeius. Go and say,</LINE>
<LINE>We purpose her no shame: give her what comforts</LINE>
<LINE>The quality of her passion shall require,</LINE>
<LINE>Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke</LINE>
<LINE>She do defeat us; for her life in Rome</LINE>
<LINE>Would be eternal in our triumph: go,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My desolation does begin to make</LINE>
<LINE>A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar;</LINE>
<LINE>Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,</LINE>
<LINE>A minister of her will: and it is great</LINE>
<LINE>To do that thing that ends all other deeds;</LINE>
<LINE>Which shackles accidents and bolts up change;</LINE>

<LINE>Antony</LINE>
<LINE>Did tell me of you, bade me trust you; but</LINE>
<LINE>I do not greatly care to be deceived,</LINE>
<LINE>That have no use for trusting. If your master</LINE>
<LINE>Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him,</LINE>
<LINE>That majesty, to keep decorum, must</LINE>
<LINE>No less beg than a kingdom: if he please</LINE>
<LINE>To give me conquer'd Egypt for my son,</LINE>

<LINE>Pray you, tell him</LINE>

<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd arm</LINE>
<LINE>Crested the world: his voice was propertied</LINE>
<LINE>As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends;</LINE>
<LINE>But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,</LINE>
<LINE>He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,</LINE>
<LINE>There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas</LINE>
<LINE>That grew the more by reaping: his delights</LINE>
<LINE>Were dolphin-like; they show'd his back above</LINE>
<LINE>The element they lived in: in his livery</LINE>
<LINE>Walk'd crowns and crownets; realms and islands were</LINE>

<LINE>You lie, up to the hearing of the gods.</LINE>

<LINE>We will extenuate rather than enforce:</LINE>

<LINE>Which towards you are most gentle, you shall find</LINE>
<LINE>A benefit in this change; but if you seek</LINE>
<LINE>To lay on me a cruelty, by taking</LINE>
<LINE>Antony's course, you shall bereave yourself</LINE>

<LINE>See, Caesar! O, behold,</LINE>
<LINE>How pomp is follow'd! mine will now be yours;</LINE>
<LINE>And, should we shift estates, yours would be mine.</LINE>
<LINE>The ingratitude of this Seleucus does</LINE>
<LINE>Even make me wild: O slave, of no more trust</LINE>
<LINE>Than love that's hired! What, goest thou back? thou shalt</LINE>
<LINE>Go back, I warrant thee; but I'll catch thine eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>Though they had wings: slave, soulless villain, dog!</LINE>
<LINE>O rarely base!</LINE>

<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good queen, let us entreat you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,</LINE>
<LINE>That thou, vouchsafing here to visit me,</LINE>
<LINE>Doing the honour of thy lordliness</LINE>
<LINE>To one so meek, that mine own servant should</LINE>
<LINE>Parcel the sum of my disgraces by</LINE>
<LINE>Addition of his envy! Say, good Caesar,</LINE>
<LINE>That I some lady trifles have reserved,</LINE>
<LINE>Immoment toys, things of such dignity</LINE>
<LINE>As we greet modern friends withal; and say,</LINE>
<LINE>Some nobler token I have kept apart</LINE>
<LINE>For Livia and Octavia, to induce</LINE>
<LINE>Their mediation; must I be unfolded</LINE>
<LINE>With one that I have bred? The gods! it smites me</LINE>
<LINE>Beneath the fall I have.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To SELEUCUS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Prithee, go hence;</LINE>
<LINE>Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits</LINE>
<LINE>Through the ashes of my chance: wert thou a man,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou wouldst have mercy on me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Forbear, Seleucus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exit SELEUCUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be it known, that we, the greatest, are misthought</LINE>
<LINE>For things that others do; and, when we fall,</LINE>
<LINE>We answer others' merits in our name,</LINE>
<LINE>Are therefore to be pitied.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cleopatra,</LINE>
<LINE>Not what you have reserved, nor what acknowledged,</LINE>
<LINE>Put we i' the roll of conquest: still be't yours,</LINE>
<LINE>Bestow it at your pleasure; and believe,</LINE>
<LINE>Caesar's no merchant, to make prize with you</LINE>
<LINE>Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheer'd;</LINE>
<LINE>Make not your thoughts your prisons: no, dear queen;</LINE>
<LINE>For we intend so to dispose you as</LINE>
<LINE>Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed, and sleep:</LINE>
<LINE>Our care and pity is so much upon you,</LINE>
<LINE>That we remain your friend; and so, adieu.</LINE>

<LINE>You with your children will he send before:</LINE>

<LINE>Now, Iras, what think'st thou?</LINE>
<LINE>Thou, an Egyptian puppet, shalt be shown</LINE>

<LINE>Nay, 'tis most certain, Iras: saucy lictors</LINE>
<LINE>Will catch at us, like strumpets; and scald rhymers</LINE>
<LINE>Ballad us out o' tune: the quick comedians</LINE>
<LINE>Extemporally will stage us, and present</LINE>
<LINE>Our Alexandrian revels; Antony</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter CHARMIAN</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Now, Charmian!</LINE>

<LINE>Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Truly, I have him: but I would not be the party</LINE>

<LINE>Rememberest thou any that have died on't?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Very many, men and women too. I heard of one of</LINE>
<LINE>them no longer than yesterday: a very honest woman,</LINE>
<LINE>but something given to lie; as a woman should not</LINE>
<LINE>do, but in the way of honesty: how she died of the</LINE>
<LINE>biting of it, what pain she felt: truly, she makes</LINE>
<LINE>a very good report o' the worm; but he that will</LINE>
<LINE>believe all that they say, shall never be saved by</LINE>
<LINE>half that they do: but this is most fallible, the</LINE>
<LINE>worm's an odd worm.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Take thou no care; it shall be heeded.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will it eat me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You must not think I am so simple but I know the</LINE>
<LINE>devil himself will not eat a woman: I know that a</LINE>
<LINE>woman is a dish for the gods, if the devil dress her</LINE>
<LINE>not. But, truly, these same whoreson devils do the</LINE>
<LINE>gods great harm in their women; for in every ten</LINE>
<LINE>that they make, the devils mar five.</LINE>

<LINE>Well, get thee gone; farewell.</LINE>

<LINE>Immortal longings in me: now no more</LINE>
<LINE>The juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip:</LINE>
<LINE>Yare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hear</LINE>
<LINE>Antony call; I see him rouse himself</LINE>
<LINE>To praise my noble act; I hear him mock</LINE>
<LINE>The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men</LINE>
<LINE>To excuse their after wrath: husband, I come:</LINE>
<LINE>Now to that name my courage prove my title!</LINE>
<LINE>I am fire and air; my other elements</LINE>
<LINE>I give to baser life. So; have you done?</LINE>
<LINE>Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips.</LINE>
<LINE>Farewell, kind Charmian; Iras, long farewell.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Kisses them. IRAS falls and dies</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?</LINE>
<LINE>If thou and nature can so gently part,</LINE>
<LINE>The stroke of death is as a lover's pinch,</LINE>
<LINE>Which hurts, and is desired. Dost thou lie still?</LINE>
<LINE>If thus thou vanishest, thou tell'st the world</LINE>
<LINE>It is not worth leave-taking.</LINE>

<LINE>This proves me base:</LINE>
<LINE>If she first meet the curled Antony,</LINE>
<LINE>He'll make demand of her, and spend that kiss</LINE>
<LINE>Which is my heaven to have. Come, thou</LINE>
<LINE>mortal wretch,</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To an asp, which she applies to her breast</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate</LINE>
<LINE>Of life at once untie: poor venomous fool</LINE>

<LINE>This was his basket.</LINE>

<LINE>Poison'd, then.</LINE>

<LINE>O Caesar,</LINE>
<LINE>This Charmian lived but now; she stood and spake:</LINE>
<LINE>I found her trimming up the diadem</LINE>
<LINE>On her dead mistress; tremblingly she stood</LINE>
<LINE>And on the sudden dropp'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O noble weakness!</LINE>
<LINE>If they had swallow'd poison, 'twould appear</LINE>
<LINE>By external swelling: but she looks like sleep,</LINE>
<LINE>As she would catch another Antony</LINE>
<LINE>In her strong toil of grace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOLABELLA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here, on her breast,</LINE>
<LINE>There is a vent of blood and something blown:</LINE>
<LINE>The like is on her arm.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Guard</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is an aspic's trail: and these fig-leaves</LINE>
<LINE>Have slime upon them, such as the aspic leaves</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the caves of Nile.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most probable</LINE>
<LINE>That so she died; for her physician tells me</LINE>
<LINE>She hath pursued conclusions infinite</LINE>
<LINE>Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed;</LINE>
<LINE>And bear her women from the monument:</LINE>
<LINE>She shall be buried by her Antony:</LINE>
<LINE>No grave upon the earth shall clip in it</LINE>
<LINE>A pair so famous. High events as these</LINE>
<LINE>Strike those that make them; and their story is</LINE>
<LINE>No less in pity than his glory which</LINE>
<LINE>Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall</LINE>
<LINE>In solemn show attend this funeral;</LINE>
<LINE>And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see</LINE>
<LINE>High order in this great solemnity.</LINE>
