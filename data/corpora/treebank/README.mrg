	      README file for Merged (a.k.a. Combined) files

The files in this hierarchy were automatically created by inserting the
part of speech tags from a tagged text file (.pos file) into a parsed text
file (.prd file).  The tags are inserted as nodes immediately dominating
the terminals.  The -NONE- node means that there is no part of speech for
that terminal symbol (i.e., it is a "null element"; see manual).

Most of the technical errors in the last release should be fixed, but note
that the combining program applies a number of patches to make the .prd and
.pos files match; see the file MERGE.LOG for the verbose information
provided by the combiner.  The combiner itself is included in this release;
see the tools/ directory for details.

These files have the extension .mrg, to distinguish them from the .cmb
files of the previous release.  The indentation of the trees is also
somewhat different than before, though the use of parentheses is unchanged.


A note about errors

These files are free from technical errors in the sense that every word has
been assigned the Part of Speech that it was annotated with in the tagged
corpus.  However, the merging of files exposes errors in the tagging that
may not otherwise be apparent, through conflicts between the parse category
and the POS tagging.  For example, consider the following partial sentence,
from wsj_0020:

( (S (NP-SBJ (PRP She) )
     (VP (VBD did)
	 (RB n't)
	 (VP (JJ elaborate)
	     ...))))

The bracketing annotator correctly described the phrase beginning with
"elaborate" as a Verb Phrase.  However, the POS-tagging annotator made an
error, and the word is tagged JJ (for adjective).  Thus this verb phrase
lacks an annotated head, although the parse is correct.  (Conversely, the
parse could be incorrect while the tagging is correct, but that is less
likely.)

Most such errors occur at a rate of 1-5%, which is probably a reflection of
the 3% estimated error rate of the original POS tagging.  The best way to
fix most of these errors, then, would be to lower the error rate of the
underlying POS tagging, a project beyond our current resources.

One class of such errors is considerably more frequent:  particles are
tagged incorrectly about half of the time.  These can be fixed fairly
simply, since they only involve a single word, so we've corrected most of
them automatically for the WSJ corpus (see tools directory for the program
used).  The program also corrects some adverbs that were mistagged as IN.

The other known errors occur at an arguably tolerable rate, and most would
require extensive hand-correction that is beyond the scope of the current
parsing project, so we have generally left these alone.  Some information
on such errors follows.


HEAD ERRORS

Ordinarily, the head of a phrase can be extracted from the POS tagging,
albeit with somewhat tortuous rules.  (Since language is complex, so is the
annotation.  No real easy way around this fact.)

For instance, a word tagged VBx or MD or TO at top-level of a VP is a head
of that VP.  Or, if there is no such head but the VP dominates one or more
nodes labelled VP, the head (or heads, in the case of coordination) of the
adjunction structure is in the dominated VP(s).  Or the VP could be a null
element, making something tagged -NONE- be the head.

However, these rules break down in about 0.5% of VPs, usually because of a
tagging error like the one described above.  Similarly, about 1-2% of PPs,
SBARs, and NPs have either no detectable head or a head that is complex to
recover (if you indulge in the complexities, the error rate goes down to
about 0.5%).

For ADJPs, the error rate may at first appear to be over 10%.  But a little
additional knowledge of parsing policy quickly brings the rate closer to
about 5%.  In particular:

  -- "%" in phrases like "a 5 % increase in sales" is bracketed in an ADJP
	but still generally tagged NN.  Currency units such as "yen" or
	"mark" (or $ ... *U*) may also play a similar role.

  -- a VBG or VBN can function as the head of an ADJP that is acting as a
	pre-head NP modifier (in which case it may be construed as a
	modifying participial phrase).

Adding several more rules and common errors may bring the rate down a bit
more, but there is a long tail of uncommon cases, perhaps because it is
more difficult to tag adjectives correctly than some other parts of speech.


SOME NON-HEAD ERRORS

1. Certain common collocations, such as "chief executive officer", lack a
common tagging.  Thus you might see any of the following:

	(NP (JJ chief) (JJ executive) (NN officer))
	(NP (JJ chief) (NN executive) (NN officer))
	(NP (NN chief) (JJ executive) (NN officer))
	(NP (NN chief) (NN executive) (NN officer))

Similar variation exists for "chief operating officer", etc.

2. Since there is no verb "to pend", one might argue that "pending" (as in
"the pending bill" or "pending the decision,...") should always be tagged
either JJ or IN, but never VBG.  Nevertheless, VBG is its most common tag.
Sometimes the error is reflected in the bracketing, and sometimes not.  As
a nominal premodifier, it will most often appear to be a single-word
participial modifier (no phrasal brackets).

	(NP (DT the) (VBG pending) (NN case))
	OR
	(NP (DT the) (JJ pending) (NN case))

	(PP (VBG pending)
	    (NP (DT the) (NN decision)))
	OR
	(S-ADV (NP-SBJ (-NONE- *))
	       (VP (VBG pending)
		   (NP (DT the) (NN decision))))
