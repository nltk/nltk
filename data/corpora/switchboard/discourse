o A.1 utt1: Okay, /
qy A.1 utt2: have you ever served as a juror? /
ng B.2 utt1: Never. /
sd^e B.2 utt2: I've never been served on the jury, never been called up in a jury, although some of my friends have been jurors. /
b A.3 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sd A.3 utt2: I never have either. /
% B.4 utt1: You haven't, {F huh. } /
qo B.4 utt2: If you were, {F uh, } what do you think about the whole concept of a trial by your peers? /
sv A.5 utt1: {D Well, } I think it's a good idea. /
sv A.5 utt2: I think our justice system needs a major overhaul, /
sd A.5 utt3: {C and } I'm not sure what needs to be done to fix it. /
sv A.5 utt4: {C But } I think they've got a lot of problems. /
sv B.6 utt1: I think the major thing they need to correct is how long it takes something to get to jury, and to get to trial. /
aa A.7 utt1: True. /
sd B.8 utt1: {C And } I don't know if that's just a pure volumes number [ or, + or ] what, /
sv B.8 utt2: {C but, } {F uh. } Sometimes I think the jury is ignorant in the facts of law and how things should be determined, /
sv B.8 utt3: {C and } they're too easily swayed by their emotion. /
aa A.9 utt1: Yeah, /
aa A.9 utt2: I think that's true. /
sv B.10 utt1: Hence is possible error as you can see in all the IRONSIDES,
x A.11 utt1: <Laughter>
+ B.12 utt1: T V shows. /
b A.13 utt1: Yeah. /
qy A.13 utt2: [ Do, + would ] you prefer all trials by a judge? /
nn B.14 utt1: No, /
sv^e B.14 utt2: I think there are certain things that, {F uh, } the jury can determine as far as, {F uh, } guilty or not guilty, /
sv B.14 utt3: {C but } as far as the [ [ af-, + af-, ] + affixing ] of punishment and fines and things of that nature, <throat_clearing> I don't know if that is best left up to the jury [ to de-, + to award, ] {D you know. } /
sv B.14 utt4: Two point two million dollar kind of settlement versus a judge knowing, {D you know, } it's true that, {D you know, } this may be sad and all that thing, /
sv B.14 utt5: {C but, } {F uh, } the jury I think is best, in most cases, suited for determination of guilt and innocence, but not the award [ of, + of ] penalties and fines and punishment. /
aa A.15 utt1: Yeah, /
aa A.15 utt2: I would agree with that. /
sv A.15 utt3: I think you're righ-, /
sv A.15 utt4: I think they sometimes get carried away by the circumstances and make huge settlements thinking {D well } it's only going to cost the insurance company, /
% A.15 utt5: {C and, } -/
aa B.16 utt1: Uh-huh, /
aa B.16 utt2: that's true. /
sv B.16 utt3: {C But, } {F uh, } I do like the idea of the jury being [ the, + the ] people who decide in the matter of, {F uh, } if it's a jail term versus life and death --
b A.17 utt1: Uh-huh. /
+ B.18 utt1: -- {D you know, } the death penalty and such. /
sv A.19 utt1: If they give them all the information. /
h A.19 utt2: I don't know, /
sv A.19 utt3: when it comes to sentencing phase, I guess they tell them [ if a guy, + if the person ] has a previous record and stuff. /
b B.20 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sv A.21 utt1: Sometimes it seems like during the trial part, the jury's [ not, + ] {D you know, } misses some of the best evidence because they make them leave, /
sd A.21 utt2: {C and } --
b B.22 utt1: Right. /
+ A.23 utt1: -- the judge decides whether or not they should hear it. /
b B.24 utt1: Yeah. /
sv B.24 utt2: {F Uh, } [ [ it, + it, ] + it's ] kind of difficult, /
sv B.24 utt3: {C and } I guess the whole system is set up to rather let, {F uh, } some guilty people go free than to put an innocent person [ in, + in ] jail --
b A.25 utt1: Right. /
+ B.26 utt1: -- although you still hear about those occasionally. /
b A.27 utt1: Yeah. /
qy A.27 utt2: Do you think the verdict should be completely unanimous by the jury? /
no B.28 utt1: {F Um, } I don't know. /
sd B.28 utt2: [ I, + {D you know, } I ] heard a very interesting, - /
h B.28 utt3: {C and } maybe it's just the T V show or movie I was watching, /
sd B.28 utt4: they were going through a trial, /
sv B.28 utt5: {C and } I think it was {D like } on one of [ the, + the ] documentary T V shows where they ask for [ the, + the ] verdict by the jury -- /
b A.29 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sd B.30 utt1: -- {C and } they went by each one, saying guilty or innocent, guilty or innocent. /
b^r A.31 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sd B.32 utt1: {C And } they took it more as just {D like } a majority. /
b A.33 utt1: Oh. /
% B.34 utt1: {D So } [ I, + I, ] -/
bf A.35 utt1: Some of them disagree, /
bf A.35 utt2: {E I mean, } some of them said one way and some the other. /
aa B.36 utt1: Exactly, /
sd B.36 utt2: {C but } they took, {D you know, } whatever the majority was. /
sd B.36 utt3: {C So } I didn't know if that was just something for drama or that's truly the way it is. /
sv B.36 utt4: I always thought it had to be unanimous. /
sv A.37 utt1: I think it does have to be unanimous. /
sv B.38 utt1: {C But, } {F uh. } Rather interesting. /
sd A.39 utt1: I know they can poll a jury, make sure everybody agrees with what they said the verdict was, /
sv A.39 utt2: {C but } I thought that they all had to agree /
sd A.39 utt3: {C or } else [ they, + it ] was a hung jury. /
b B.40 utt1: Uh-huh. /
% A.41 utt1: {C And, } -/
sd B.42 utt1: [ I did, + I did ] also. /
b A.43 utt1: Yeah, /
sd A.43 utt2: [ I thi-, + ] I don't know how I feel about that. /
sv A.43 utt3: I think maybe, {F uh, } majority might be sufficient. /
b B.44 utt1: Uh-huh. /
h A.45 utt1: It's hard to say though. /
qy^d B.46 utt1: What about in international trials. /
qy B.46 utt2: Do you think they should have a jury there? /
^h A.47 utt1: Oh. /
sv B.48 utt1: I think that would be kind of interesting. /
b A.49 utt1: Yeah, /
sd A.49 utt2: I hadn't thought about international trials at all. /
sv B.50 utt1: I guess [ the, + the ] problem with that is there's no true authority in any kind of international verdicts --
b A.51 utt1: Right. /
+ B.52 utt1: -- like, {D you know, } the old day with the rack. /
sd(^q) B.52 utt2: [ We, + they're ] going to say, Okay, you're guilty and you have to pay Kuwait four million dollars. /
qh B.52 utt3: {D Well, } whose going to really make them. /
b A.53 utt1: Yeah. /
sd B.54 utt1: Nobody. /
b^r A.55 utt1: Yeah, /
sv B.56 utt1: [ {C So. } + {C But } ] I think it would be kind of interesting to incorporate that concept of, {D you know, } people from different countries, {F uh, } in as international law also. /
b A.57 utt1: Yeah, /
sv A.57 utt2: I think maybe they'd need to be more knowledgeable though than just your average Joe off the street --
b B.58 utt1: Uh-huh. /
+ A.59 utt1: -- for something like that because of the cultural differences.
b B.60 utt1: Right. /
+ A.61 utt1: Things like that. /
sd B.62 utt1: I don't know [ how, + what ] it would take to [ be, + come up ] with a true perfect system, {E or } if one exists. /
% B.62 utt2: {C But, } -/
b A.63 utt1: Yeah. /
o@ A.63 utt2: What about uniform sentencing?
qy^h B.64 utt1: {F Uh, } is that the crime /
qy^d B.64 utt2: {C and } it's already, (( )) some chart and determine the punishment, /
% B.64 utt3: {C or. } -/
+@ A.65 utt1: Right. /
ny A.65 utt2: Yeah, /
sd^e A.65 utt3: {D like } if you're convicted of a certain crime you automatically get so many years. /
sd A.65 utt4: It's not a discretionary thing. /
b B.66 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sv B.66 utt2: I think there should be a core minimum that they get -- /
b A.67 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sv B.68 utt1: -- {C but, } {F uh, } I guess there should be some flexibility because every situation may be unique, that the judge can either increase that or keep it just at its minimum, things of that nature. /
% B.68 utt2: {C But, } -/
b A.69 utt1: Yeah. /
sv A.69 utt2: I wish that when they sentence someone, if they're going to sentence him to five years, then make him serve five years. /
aa B.70 utt1: Yeah, /
sv B.70 utt2: that serves a kind of if they're, I guess, {F uh, } - /
sd B.70 utt3: if you sentence someone to life, life is only forty-nine years, something like that. /
b A.71 utt1: Yeah, /
% A.71 utt2: I, -/
sv B.72 utt1: {C And } I guess you're eligible after twenty-seven for parole, even though you're in for life. /
b A.73 utt1: Yeah, /
sv A.73 utt2: {C and } sometimes those people [ are, + are ] young enough, they can still get out and cause a lot of trouble. /
b B.74 utt1: Yeah, /
sv B.74 utt2: although I guess it's, [ you, + you ] want them to rehabilitate and become better rather than sitting in there and being a drain all the time. /
b A.75 utt1: Yeah, /
sv A.75 utt2: I don't believe that very often happens. /
aa B.76 utt1: No. /
sv B.76 utt2: {C Because } {F uh, } inside the jail [ there, + I don't think there's ] no real rehabilitation. /
aa A.77 utt1: I don't think so either. /
sv A.77 utt2: In fact, I think they end up worse, because the conditions are so bad. /
b B.78 utt1: Yeah, /
bf B.78 utt2: it's another war zone. /
aa A.79 utt1: Yeah. /
qh B.80 utt1: {C But, } who knows. /
sv A.81 utt1: [ I think, + I think ] maybe they ought to just be punished with [ some, + some ] kind of real punishment, like hard labor for a shorter length of time, {D you know. } /
aa B.82 utt1: I agree, /
sv B.82 utt2: get them out there, /
sv A.83 utt1: Actually make them do something that's not pleasant and do it and get it over with and get back in the, {D you know, } world and not spend so much time sitting around, letting the bad influences of the other ones rub off on them, /
% A.83 utt2: {C and, } -/
aa B.84 utt1: Sure, /
sv B.84 utt2: they should have them go out and doing stuff.
b A.85 utt1: Yeah. /
+ B.86 utt1: Cleaning up, or picking up dirt, or weeds, or who knows what. Something [ for the, + for the ] state, /
sv B.86 utt2: since the state is paying for them, they should get some [ kind of, + kind of ] work out of them. /

sv B.2 utt2: I think, {F uh, } as far as, {F uh, } protecting fellow employees, protecting their reputation of the company and the quality of work that the people do, {F um, } it's justified. /
sv B.2 utt3: On the other hand, {F um, } I do agree that [ [ it's, + it's a, ] + it's an ] invasion of privacy as far as a person's involvement outside of work. /

aa B.12 utt1: That's absolutely right. /
sv B.12 utt2: [ [ It, + it, ] + {F uh, } I guess it ] all comes down to, {F uh, } {D you know, } [ a, + a ] definition of, {F uh, } how much [ out, + outside ] activities affect your work /
% B.12 utt3: {C and, } {F uh, } {F uh, } granted, {D you know, } that, - /
sv B.12 utt4: [ any, + any ] kind of drug use [ on, + on ] company property and whatnot,
b A.13 utt1: Yeah. /

+ B.16 utt1: Or, {F uh, } [ any, + any ] after affects carrying over into the workday /

aa A.17 utt1: # Yeah, /

sv B.18 utt2: on the other hand [ [ you, + you've got, ] + {F uh, } you've got ] [ the, + {F uh, } the ] possibility of people, {F oh, } - /
sv B.18 utt3: you've got some people could be arrested for, {F uh, } drug use, drug dealings and things like that, /
sv B.18 utt4: {C and, } {F uh, } [ if their, + if their ] employers name hits the papers and that [ [ it's, + it's, ] +
b A.19 utt1: Yeah. /

sv B.20 utt2: the company and, {F uh, } {D you know, } what kind of people work there, # what, {F uh, } # -/
sv A.21 utt1: # {C Plus, } I # guess, if they are in problem enough to be jailed or something of that nature for any length of time, then the company has lost what they've put into that employee,
aa B.22 utt1: That's right. /

+ A.23 utt1: and their expertise or whatever. /
b B.24 utt1: Right. /
sd B.24 utt2: [ E-, + even ] if it is, {D you know, } a company policy of, {F uh, } immediate termination or whatever, they still have to replace them. /
b A.25 utt1: Yeah. /
sv B.26 utt1: {C And, } {F uh, } [ there's, + there's ] a lot involved there. /
qy A.27 utt1: {D Well, } do you think that, {F um, } it should be like we have this sort of random spot testing type of thing /
qrr A.27 utt2: {C or } do you think it would be more palatable if we had some sort of regular schedule /
qrr A.27 utt3: {C or } would that just allow everybody a chance to get out of it? /
sv B.28 utt1: [ I think, + I think ] the regular schedule stuff, {F um, } that when you say everybody get out of it, that's a good point, /
sd B.28 utt2: I never really thought of it that way. /
sd A.29 utt1: {D Well, } {D you know, } [ if, + if ] they have time enough they can,
b B.30 utt1: Yeah, /
sd B.30 utt2: if # they really can, # /
+ A.31 utt1: # stay off of it. # /
sv B.32 utt1: {F um, } I think [ the big-, + the biggest ] problem I've got [ is, + is ] forcing it on someone after they've already agreed to the terms of employment. /
b A.33 utt1: Yeah. /
sd B.34 utt1: {F Um, } as far as the new hires, [ I, + I ] hired on just early enough that [ I, + I ] missed it. {F Um, } where the new hires were concerned /
% B.34 utt2: {C but, } {F uh, } [ [ not, + nobody, ] + no, ] /
sv B.34 utt3: I don't think anybody questions that, {F um, } testing someone [ as a, + as a ] precondition to being hired /
sv B.34 utt4: {C but, } {F um, } for the conditions that, for our employment to change while you're on the job [ [ that's, + [ I, + I ] don't know, that, ] + that's ] where I think that most people get upset. /
sv B.34 utt5: [ [ It's, + {F uh, } {D you know, } it, ] + it's ] changing the rules in the middle of the game basically /
sv B.34 utt6: {C and, } {F uh, }
b A.35 utt1: Yeah. /
+ B.36 utt1: [ [ It's just, + it, ] + it's ] a really tough question /

sv A.21 utt2: I think it ought to be mandatory. {F Uh, } for kids to [ either, + either ] do military service, or public service, one of the two. /
sv A.21 utt3: {F Uh, } a lot of reasons for that, [ not, + not ] just because [ I'm a, + I'm a ] hard ass or anything. /
b B.22 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sv A.23 utt1: It's just that, like you say, kids are getting out of high school not knowing what in the heck they're going to do, /
sv A.23 utt2: {C and } either the military or public service organization can give them a lot of focus. /
sv A.23 utt3: {C And, } I think that it might stop us some problems later on. /
sv A.23 utt4: {E I mean, } {D you know } [ y-, + ] these kids will get [ their, + their ] heads on straight, [ and, + and ] figure out what they want to do, instead of hanging around street corners selling drugs or something. /
sv A.23 utt5: {F Uh, } [ it's, + I think it would be ] good for them, {F uh, } /
sv A.23 utt6: it helps mature them a little bit, and helps them understand the world, the way it really is. /
b B.24 utt1: Yeah, /
sv B.24 utt2: I think a lot of people grow up [ with, + {F uh, } with, ] {F uh, } preconceived notions [ li-, + ] what the world's about. /

sd A.71 utt2: my mom's in the same position, late sixties, /
sd A.71 utt3: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] it [ got to the, + got to the ] point where, {E I mean, } me and my brother both [ were, + were ] gone, and she couldn't maintain the house, without large expenditures of money. /
b B.72 utt1: Yeah. /
sd A.73 utt1: {D You know, } it finally got to a point where she just had to sell it and move into an apartment. /
sd A.73 utt2: {C And, } {F uh, } [ [ I, + I'm not, ] + I'm not ] saying that that wouldn't have happened anyway, /
sv A.73 utt3: {C but } it would have been nice if there had been somebody to come around and take care of the little things. {D You know, } [ like the, + like the ] yard work and little repairs, and painting and stuff like that. /
b B.74 utt1: Yeah. /
sv B.74 utt2: I think [ there'd, + there'd ] be [ a, + {D you know, } a, ] {F uh, } economic benefit for, {D you know, } everyone concerned,

% A.79 utt7: {C and, } -/
b B.80 utt1: Yeah. /
sd B.80 utt2: I think, {F uh, } President Bush covered that in his, {F uh, } State of the Union Address this year when he said that, {D you know, } it's time for, {D you know, } the individuals to start thinking about what they can do to help each other out instead of counting on government to do everything. /
b A.81 utt1: Yeah, /
sv A.81 utt2: {D well } [ [ that's, + that's the, ] + that's the ] point we've gotten to, {D you know. } /

sv A.83 utt1: We don't need to add fourteen layers of bureaucracy to a program. /
aa B.84 utt1: Exactly. /
sd A.85 utt1: {F Um, } the thing that Carter works on, {F uh, } Habitats For Humanity, I was involved in that [ w-, + ] {F uh, } in Montgomery, before I came up to North Carolina, /
b B.86 utt1: Uh-huh /
x B.86 utt2: <throat_clearing>.
sv A.87 utt1: {C and, } {F uh, } [ it was, + it was ] a pretty neat little program. /
sd A.87 utt2: We'd just go out, /
sd A.87 utt3: and they would buy a plot of land, and contractors and builders, /
sd A.87 utt4: {C and } everybody else would donate [ their, + their ] time, /
sd A.87 utt5: {C and, } {F uh, } the materials were at cost. /
sd A.87 utt6: {C And } we'd put up houses. /
sv A.87 utt7: {C And, } [ that was kind, + that was kind ] of neat. /
sv A.87 utt8: [ I, + {F uh, } in a way, I ] think it's a little bit inefficient, /
sv A.87 utt9: [ {C but, } + {C but } ] it's better than nothing. /
b B.88 utt1: Yeah. /
sd A.89 utt1: [ {C And, } + {C and } ] at least I had the opportunity of seeing two families move into decent housing. /
sv A.89 utt2: {F Um, } course, on the other hand, I can start complaining very loudly about people on public assistance who are quite capable of doing something for themselves, but just won't.
b B.90 utt1: Yes. /
+ A.91 utt1: Because it's far more advantageous for them to sit there and just draw, {F uh, } welfare money than it is to work. /
sd A.91 utt2: {F Uh, } we did [ a, + {F uh, } a ] cost comparison in one of my courses, /
sd A.91 utt3: {C and } we took all the benefits [ that a family, + that [ a, + a ] married couple ] with two kids would get under welfare, {C and } what they would be making at minimum wage. /
sd A.91 utt4: {C And } they came out four thousand dollars better a year, by taking welfare. /
b B.92 utt1: Yes. /
sv A.93 utt1: {C So } there's no incentive for them to do anything. /
sv A.93 utt2: <<pause>> Far better for them to sit on their butts and draw the money. /
b B.94 utt1: Yeah. /
sd B.94 utt2: One of the things they tried to push through in Maryland, {C and, } {F uh, } weren't very successful was that if you were an able-bodied person on welfare,

sd B.2 utt1: <TV> {D Well } I think, I don't know how your schools work back there /
sd B.2 utt2: {C but } we support our schools here with property taxes. /
b A.3 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sd B.4 utt1: {C And } the land owners or home owners are the ones that pay the school tax. /
sd B.4 utt2: {C So } if you're renting a house or doing anything else, you're not actually contributing to the education of your children. /
sv B.4 utt3: {C And } I think that's wrong, /
sv B.4 utt4: I think everybody should contribute to the education of their children even if they had to raise the sales tax by one percent then everybody going through the state would be supporting our education system. /
sv B.4 utt5: {C So, } as it turns out, we don't really have a tremendous education system because they don't have the money they need to run it. /
b A.5 utt1: Yeah, /
sd A.5 utt2: [ I, + {F uh, } I ] spent a couple, {F uh, } years down in, {F uh, } Plano, Texas. /

b B.10 utt1: Yeah. /
sd A.11 utt1: {C And, } {F uh, } [ I, f-, + {D you know, } I ] know that Texas doesn't have a state tax, /
aa B.12 utt1: No, /
aa B.12 utt2: huh-uh. /
sd A.13 utt1: {C and so } all the things come out of [ the, + the ] property taxes, /
b B.14 utt1: Yeah. /
sd A.15 utt1: {C and } I was, {F uh, } really shocked at the amount of taxes I ended up paying. /
sd A.15 utt2: [ I was, + I was ] better off paying a state tax [ mo-, + ] back in Maryland, where, <breathing> <laughter>, -/
aa B.16 utt1: Yeah, /
aa^r B.16 utt2: yeah /
sv B.16 utt3: you would be. /
sd A.17 utt1: than I was, {F uh, } paying the, {F uh, } property tax down there. /
sd A.17 utt2: {F Uh, } what they did in Maryland to get around that is [ they, + {F uh, } they ] developed a renters tax solely for the purpose of paying for the services,
b B.18 utt1: Oh. /
+ A.19 utt1: that the renters were getting including the, {F uh, } educational services. /
b B.20 utt1: Yeah. /
sd A.21 utt1: {C And, } {F uh, } the tax was administered by, {F uh, } the, {F uh, } rental company that actually was managing the apartments /
sd A.21 utt2: {C so } [ when, +
b B.22 utt1: Oh. /
+ A.23 utt1: {F uh, } long, long time ago, when ] I used to live in apartments, I would pay a rent payment every month and a tax payment every month. /
ba B.24 utt1: Gee. /
sd A.25 utt1: {C And } the tax payment went to pay for the services that I was getting as [ a, + a ] resident of that particular county. /
b B.26 utt1: Yeah. /
sd A.27 utt1: {C And, } {F uh, } that's the way it worked. /
sd A.27 utt2: Here in Maryland [ we have, + ] {F uh, } a certain portion of [ your, + your ] property taxes, {F uh, } goes to education, /
b B.28 utt1: Yeah. /
sd A.29 utt1: {C but } also a portion of the state tax that you pay goes back into the county that you live in, to pay for the educational system. /
ba B.30 utt1: {F Oh, } {D well that's pretty good. } /
sv A.31 utt1: {C And so } [ it, + it ] works out nice, /
sd A.31 utt2: [ [ it, + it, ] + it ] makes it so that the, {F uh, } whole county now, - /
sd A.31 utt3: [ I, + I ] know the concept of counties in Texas is quite a bit different than it is here in Maryland, {F uh, } /
sd A.31 utt4: like Collin County, {F uh, } would only equal about maybe an eighth the size of Baltimore County, here in Maryland. /
b B.32 utt1: {F Oh, } yeah. /
sd A.33 utt1: {E I mean } [ the, + the ] counties are much larger. /
b B.34 utt1: Yeah. /
sv A.35 utt1: {D You know, } in [ the, + the ] whole state of Maryland I believe there's only like, {F uh, } fifteen counties. /
ba B.36 utt1: Gee whiz. /
sv A.37 utt1: {C And, so, } {F uh, } {D you know } each county has their own school system [ {C an, } + {C and } ] it works out real nice. /
qy A.37 utt2: {F Um, } [ the, + the ] flip side to this is, are we getting what we're paying for, /
b B.38 utt1: Yeah. /
sv A.39 utt1: {C and } I don't believe so, {F um. } /
sd A.39 utt2: A lot of things have come to head recently /
sd A.39 utt3: {C and } I heard a report because, of, {F uh, } {F uh, } the emphasis that the President was putting on education, {D you know, }
b B.40 utt1: Uh-huh. /
+ A.41 utt1: {F uh, } him running as our education president and then finally a couple of years later getting around to doing something. /
b B.42 utt1: Yeah. /
sd A.43 utt1: {F Um, } they said since they imposed the federal regulations on education, /
sd A.43 utt2: in other words, they came up with this federalized system where everyone in the third grade would be taught basically the same thing. /
b B.44 utt1: Yeah. /
sd A.45 utt1: {C And, then, } at the end of, {F uh, } school year they would be tested /
sd A.45 utt2: {C and then } they go into the fourth grade /
sd A.45 utt3: {C and } everybody in the fourth grade's basically taught the same thing. /
b B.46 utt1: Yeah. /
sd A.47 utt1: {C So } when they came up with [ these, + this ] nationwide system of public schools, {F uh, } they gave some figures out /
sd A.47 utt2: {C and } since it's inception, {F uh, } they've, [ the price has gone up per stu-, + the prices paid by the federal government per student ] has been thirty-three percent. /
ba B.48 utt1: Yow. /
sd A.49 utt1: {C And so } they're actually spending thirty-three percent, /
sd A.49 utt2: {C and } that's real dollars, {D you know, }
b B.50 utt1: Yeah. /
+ A.51 utt1: adjusting it back [ to, + to ] the days, {D you know, } when it started, {F uh, } probably, {D you know, } seventy years ago. /
sd A.51 utt2: {C And } what they've said is that we haven't had a thirty-three percent improvement in education. /
b B.52 utt1: No, /
b B.52 utt2: huh-uh. /
sd A.53 utt1: We've actually gone backwards. /
sd B.54 utt1: {D Well } they say that Texas schools are some of the lowest in the nation. /
sd B.54 utt2: That our high school graduates can't even match the national average. /
b A.55 utt1: Yeah. /
sv B.56 utt1: {C So, } {D you know, } our school system down here is no where near perfect /

b A.57 utt1: Yeah, /

sd A.59 utt1: {F Uh, } they've been putting a lot of, {F uh, } stress on it /

sd A.59 utt3: {C and } of course they've, {F uh, } been cutting the teachers salaries,
b B.60 utt1: {F Oh, } yeah. /

b B.22 utt1: Yeah /
sd B.22 utt2: that's {F uh, } something I hadn't really thought about because we don't have children. /

sd A.23 utt1: {D Well, } we keep a shelter, also monies that we're going to pay in for child care too. /

sd A.23 utt3: {C and } as long as you pay that amount you're okay. /
sd A.23 utt4: {C But } if you paid in more than you actually used, and the same thing for insurance, what you predict your going to be paying for insurance, as long as you [ pay, + actually pay ] out that amount of money, you're okay. /

qo A.43 utt2: {C so. } Let's see what else can we do? /
% A.43 utt3: Changes, -/
sd B.44 utt1: I'll tell you what we could do. /
qw A.45 utt1: What? /
sd B.46 utt1: We could prohibit people from being hired that are historically going to cost the company money. {D You know, } do a little bit better research on who gets hired -- /
b A.47 utt1: Uh-huh. /
% B.48 utt1: -- {C Because } {D you know, } -/

aap B.50 utt1: {D Well, } not only just health insurance, {E I mean } for the whole benefit of the company. /
sd B.50 utt2: {D See, } I look at it this way. If the company folds, I got to go find a job. /
b A.51 utt1: Yeah. /
b B.52 utt1: Okay. /
sv B.52 utt2: {D Now, } if we got somebody in a position to affect the way the company performs, just about anybody in the company, and they're not doing their job or they're not capable of doing their job, then we should find (A) a place to put them or (B) {D you know, } boot them out. /
sv A.53 utt1: {D Well, } that's easier done in a company than it is in, {F uh, } school teaching. /
sv B.54 utt1: {D Well, } frankly, I think school teachers ought to get about ten times what they're getting paid. /
ba A.55 utt1: <Breathing> Thank you <laughter>. /
br B.56 utt1: What? /

sd A.59 utt1: We're both school teachers. /
% B.60 utt1: {F Oh, } [ I'm, + I'm, ] -/
sd A.61 utt1: {C But } it's hard to get rid of a teacher if they're not good. /
sd B.62 utt1: I know. /
sd A.63 utt1: It's almost impossible. /
sd B.64 utt1: {D Well, } there's two schools of thought on that. /
sd B.64 utt2: {D You know, } [ I, + I'm ] looking at trying to get into a university job position as a a professor -- /
b A.65 utt1: Huh-uh. /
sd B.66 utt1: -- I got about eight years of education ahead of me before I can do that -- /
% A.67 utt1: {F Um. } /
sd B.68 utt1: -- {C but, } once you get that job with the university, you've got ten years of probation. /
b A.69 utt1: Huh-uh. /
sd B.70 utt1: Then you have tenure. /
sd B.70 utt2: {C And } they can't fire you. /
b A.71 utt1: Huh-uh. /
sd B.72 utt1: {D Well, } {D you know, } in a situation like that, I don't know if that's good or bad. /
sd B.72 utt2: I do know that I've had tenured professors that were just sorry. /
b A.73 utt1: Right. /
sd B.74 utt1: {C And } I've also had tenured professors that were the best things on two legs. /
sd A.75 utt1: {D Well, } they did away with tenure in teaching along time ago, {D you know, } in the public schools. /
% B.76 utt1: {C But } in addition. -/
sd A.77 utt1: It makes you more at ease. /
sd A.77 utt2: {D You know, } you knew you weren't going to lose your job unless you really did something horrendous. /
sd B.78 utt1: {D Well, } [ they, + they ] really can't fire you without cause, /
sd B.78 utt2: {D you know } the governments taken care of that, /
sv B.78 utt3: {C but, } {F um, } what I'm looking at is, {D you know, } there are a lot of teachers that aren't getting paid what they need to be getting paid, /
sv B.78 utt4: {C and } there are some teachers <noise> out there that aren't worth having around as janitors. /
b A.79 utt1: Right. /
sd B.80 utt1: {D You know, } {C and } I could see a point protecting someone's position, /
sv B.80 utt2: {C but, } on the other hand, I don't think [ it, + {D you know, } that ] someone that teaches, {F uh, } say shop, for instance, should have to have degree at all. /
sd A.81 utt1: {D Well } they don't. /
% B.82 utt1: {D Well. } -/
sd A.83 utt1: In some places they don't. /
sd^m B.84 utt1: In some places that don't. /
qy A.85 utt1: Do they? /
sd B.86 utt1: {C But, } {D you know, } [ you, + you ] get specialized education now, for instance, take computer science. /
sv B.86 utt2: We've got kids twenty years old, right now, that could beat any computer professor at micro computer applications. /
sv B.86 utt3: I know we could. /
sd B.86 utt4: {C And } these people can't even get jobs doing anything besides digging ditches, because there's no comprehensive test that they can take, that would allow them [ to, + to ] step into that position without having to go through the rigamarole of college. /
b A.87 utt1: Yeah. /
sd B.88 utt1: {D You know, } I went to college late on in life /
sd B.88 utt2: {C and } I realize that hey, it's nothing but four years of endurance /
sd B.88 utt3: {C and } you might be teachable, /
^g B.88 utt4: {D you } know what I mean? /
ny A.89 utt1: Yeah. /
sv* B.90 utt1: {E I mean, } my agree is absolutely worthless. /*[[listen; agree is probably degree]]
x A.91 utt1: <Laughter>.
sv B.92 utt1: It's my experience [ and, + and ] my knowledge [ that, + that ] is beneficial, /
sd B.92 utt2: {C but } then, {D you know, } like I said, I came in backwards. /
qw A.93 utt1: What did you get your degree at? /
sd B.94 utt1: Industrial Marketing. /
qw A.95 utt1: {C And } what's your job now? /
sd B.96 utt1: {D Well, } actually I'm selling computer software. /
sd B.96 utt2: {C But, } the two are mutually exclusive. Because, <noise> [ the, + the ] experience that got me the job that I got now, was my experience in the construction field, prior to going to college --
b A.97 utt1: Huh-uh. /
+ B.98 utt1: -- not my degree, which is I think kind of bizarre. /

sd A.99 utt4: {F Oh, } I'd like to see flexible hours. And teaching,

+ A.101 utt1: shared, job sharing,

sv A.105 utt2: It would be nice if you had full insurance coverage if you were doing job sharing. /
t1 A.105 utt3: What else. /
sd A.105 utt4: I'd like to be able [ to, + to ] evaluate your boss /

sd A.105 utt6: {C and } you get to choose your boss. /
% B.106 utt1: {D Well, } - /
b B.106 utt2: yeah. /
sv B.106 utt3: Supervisor evaluations have always been a tough one. Especially in my line, because, {D you know, } my supervisor has nothing to with my job, except to make sure I get my check. /
b A.107 utt1: Huh-uh. /
x B.108 utt1: <Laughter>.
qy A.109 utt1: {D Well, } {C so } you get to evaluate him though? /

sd B.110 utt3: {E I mean, } [ my, + my, ] supervisor level is {D like } practically zero. /
sd B.110 utt4: I run the whole show. /
sd B.110 utt5: {C And } when I need something, I tell my boss /
sd B.110 utt6: {C and } he gets it for me, because he knows, that I know, what I'm doing. /
b A.111 utt1: Yeah. /
sv B.112 utt1: {D You know, } {C and } {F uh, } [ that, + that ] is something that I think needs to be expanded on, specially in the large market place. {D You know, } the major corporation, because so often, {D you know, } you get a guy who's got eight or nine or ten people working for him in separate areas --
b A.113 utt1: Yeah. /
+ B.114 utt1: -- so to speak. /
sd B.114 utt2: {D You know, } [ it's, + it's ] hard for me to, {D you know, } especially since I'm in marketing sales, {D you know, } /
sd B.114 utt3: I make more than my boss. Because he's salary and I'm not. /
sd B.114 utt4: I make as much as I earn. /
sd B.114 utt5: {D You know, } if I don't make a sale, I don't make anything <laughter>. /
b A.115 utt1: Huh-uh. /
b B.116 utt1: Yeah. /
sv B.116 utt2: {D Well } it's tough, /
sd B.116 utt3: {C but, } {F uh, } {D you know, } there are requirements, and quotas, what not, for me to make, /
sv B.116 utt4: {C but, } {F um, } the bottom line [ on, + on ] that kind of thing is, {D you know, } we have a lot of people, especially in major corporations, who aren't doing a damn thing. /
sv B.116 utt5: They're just there. /
sv B.116 utt6: {D You know, } the work they do could be totally eliminated, /
sv B.116 utt7: {C and } not that they aren't worth or not that they aren't trying or anything. But, it's just that their jobs are useless. /

sv B.100 utt2: {C and } it stands out. /
b A.101 utt1: Yeah, /
sd A.101 utt2: this house that I have is just a three bedroom ranch /

% B.102 utt1: {F Um. } /
+ A.103 utt1: -- foundation all the way around it. Not a shrub, not a bush. /
sd A.103 utt2: There was a lilac tree, /
sd(^q) A.103 utt3: {C and } the landlord cut it down {C and } said, Yeah, that's one thing you have to do is keep that lilac bush cut down so it doesn't rub up against the siding -- /
ba@ B.104 utt1: {F Oh, } gee.
sd(^q) A.105 utt1: -- {C And } I'm looking at him like, Jeez. /

sd A.107 utt2: {C So. } That's all right. /

sd A.107 utt4: Anything, as long as it doesn't rub up against the siding. -/
b^m B.108 utt1: Rub up against the siding. {F Uh, } /
b A.109 utt1: Yeah, /
sd A.109 utt2: that's what he's worried about. The trees, or a bush, because lilac bushes, [ they, + they ] grow fast. /
sv A.109 utt3: Some people, {F uh, } would really like to have them, /
sv A.109 utt4: {C and then } the people that do have them, they spread, and they sprout all over [ th-, + their ] lawn. /
b B.110 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sv A.111 utt1: {C So, } they're kind of a pain, /
sv A.111 utt2: {C but, } {D you know, } people who don't have them think they're great. /
sv A.111 utt3: {C And } people who do have them,
x B.112 utt1: <Laughter>.
+ A.113 utt1: curse. /
b B.114 utt1: Right. /
sv A.115 utt1: Another thing I have that, {F um, } is weird is [ the, + a ] locus tree in the back yard. /
sd A.115 utt2: As a matter of fact there's three of them, very badly trimmed, /
sd A.115 utt3: they aren't trimmed at all. /
b B.116 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sd A.117 utt1: {C And } I can imagine if I had to mow the lawn in the back, which we said we'd do, if the trees hang down - /
sd A.117 utt2: [ {C so, } + {C and } ] the locus trees have like three quarters of an inch thorns on it. /
aa B.118 utt1: Yeah, /
sd B.118 utt2: they're like, - /
sd B.118 utt3: I think I've seen those before, /
sd B.118 utt4: {C but } I don't remember what they look like. /
sv A.119 utt1: They're a pretty tree, /
sd A.119 utt2: {C but } [ you just, + when you ] walk up to them they're covered with thorns. /
sd A.119 utt3: {C So } we're going to get a chain saw and limb it extensively so it gets the trees up overhead, /
bf B.120 utt1: {C So } it'll give you room to get under it, /
aa B.120 utt2: sure, /
aa A.121 utt1: <Laughter> Yeah, /
sd A.121 utt2: because I can just see brushing up against it, that it would --
b B.122 utt1: Yeah. /
+ A.123 utt1: -- rip your skin. /
sv A.123 utt2: It's worse than a rose bush. /
% B.124 utt1: {F Um. } /
sv A.125 utt1: Many times worse, because of course, it's a tree. /
sv B.126 utt1: {F Oh, } a tree (( )) is always something very nice to have. /
b A.127 utt1: Yeah, /
sd A.127 utt2: my dad used to work on them, /
sd A.127 utt3: {C so } I don't think I'll have a problem. /
sd A.127 utt4: My husband will have problems borrowing one. /
ad B.128 utt1: <Laughter> then you got to get him to, - /
sd B.128 utt2: if he's going to do it, you've got to twist his arm to get him to go do it. /
sd A.129 utt1: {D Well, } if that's not the problem ... -/

qy A.1 utt1: {D So, } do you fish? /
ny B.2 utt1: {F Oh, } yeah. /
sd^e B.2 utt2: My dad has a lake cabin, /
sd B.2 utt3: {C and so } we go there for the small lake, {F uh, } just outside of the Dallas Fort Worth area. /
sd B.2 utt4: It takes us about three hours to get there. /
sd B.2 utt5: {C And } we go, and we fish, /
sd B.2 utt6: {C and } we catch a bunch of junk <laughter>. [ Nothing, + nothing ] to talk about for the most part, /
sd B.2 utt7: {C but } it's fun. /
qr A.3 utt1: {F Uh, } from a boat or from shore? /

% A.5 utt3: {C or, } -/

sd B.6 utt3: {C And, } {D you know, } we go ahead and eat those. /
sd B.6 utt4: {C But } we've never caught enough to really have what you'd call a fish fry. /
sd B.6 utt5: What we normally do is just, {F uh, } go ahead and clean it up, and then, {F uh, } {D you know, } put it in a bag and freeze it. /
sd B.6 utt6: [ {C And, } + {C and } ] somebody takes it home and eats it then when there's just a couple people instead of a whole crowd. /
sd B.6 utt7: {D Usually, } there's a pretty good crowd there, /
sd B.6 utt8: {C so } we don't ever catch enough to eat. /
sd B.6 utt9: Carp is usually pretty much fun. /
sd B.6 utt10: {C Because } I've caught up to about an eight pound carp on [ a little, + {D you know, } a little ] pole with twenty pound test line. /
sd B.6 utt11: {C And } [ that, + that's ] a pretty good fight. /

sd B.1 utt2: in order to make the, {F uh, } curried chicken, I just fried the chicken,

+ B.3 utt1: until it was nice and brown, {D you know } /
ad B.3 utt2: make sure it's nice and brown on both sides /
ad B.3 utt3: {C and then } you take it out of the fat /
ad B.3 utt4: {C and } [ you, + you ] let the chicken you fried kind of drain, so that a lot of the oil comes out of it <cough>. /
b A.4 utt1: Uh-huh. /
ad B.5 utt1: {C And then } [ you, + you, ] {F uh, } pour [ most of the, + all of the ] oil out of the pan /
ad B.5 utt2: {C and } you kind of clean it out /
ad B.5 utt3: {C and } you put back maybe two tablespoons full of the oil and saute some, {F um, } bell peppers and onions [ in, + in ] that little bit of oil. /
ad B.5 utt4: Maybe one tablespoon or two tablespoons, let that brown, then put all of the chicken back in there. /
ad B.5 utt5: {C And then } you, {F uh, } mix flour and a cup of water, maybe, {F uh, } one tablespoon of flour and a cup of water. /
ad B.5 utt6: Stir it real, real well. /
b A.6 utt1: Uh-huh. /
ad B.7 utt1: Then you, {F uh, } pour that in there, {D you know, } to make the gravy. /
ad B.7 utt2: {C And } you let it come to a boil again /
ad B.7 utt3: {C and then } you let it simmer /
ad B.7 utt4: {C and } you add, {F uh, } about a tablespoon of, what I'm using now is Jamaican curry powder. /

aa B.13 utt1: Right, /
sd B.13 utt2: {C and then } if you like it really hot, you can add some hot, hot peppers and hot sauce and all that kind of stuff. /

b B.19 utt1: Oh. /
sd A.20 utt1: {F Uh, } {C and } I cook a little bit now. /
sd A.20 utt2: What I like to do mostly is stir fries /
sd(^q) A.20 utt3: {C and } my wife normally says, {F oh, } Tom, [ why, + why ] don't you make a stir fry tonight /
sd A.20 utt4: {C and so } [ we even, + we just ] were recently married so we have a stir fry pan sort of like a big wok. /
b B.21 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sd A.22 utt1: {C And } we do a lot of, {F um, } stir fry vegetables. /
qw B.23 utt1: What kind of wok do you have, /
qy B.23 utt2: [ is it, + is it ] a real Chinese wok. /
sd A.24 utt1: [ It's, + it's ] called a stir fry pan /

sd A.24 utt3: {C so } [ it's, + it ] has a flatter bottom than a normal wok does. /
b B.25 utt1: Uh-huh. /
b B.25 utt2: I see. /
sd A.26 utt1: {C And, } {F um, } normally [ what happ-, + what we ] do is, {F um, } just, {D you know, } like two tablespoons of oil, maybe sesame oil {C or } some other type of oil than just regular [ oi-, + vegetable oil. ] /
sd A.26 utt2: {C But } I will use [ peanut, + peanut ] oil, or things. /
sd A.26 utt3: {C And then } we just stir fry broccoli and carrots and, {F um, } green peppers, and, {F um, } maybe put in a little bit of, {F um } garlic and ginger, {F uh, } beforehand. /
sd A.26 utt4: That gives, {F uh, } {F uh, } {F uh, } spicier flavor /
sd A.26 utt5: {C and then } after the stir fry is over, just mix in, {F um, } a little bit of, {F uh, } sometimes chicken broth,
b B.27 utt1: Yeah. /
+ A.28 utt1: and corn starch and soy sauce /
sd A.28 utt2: {C and } that sort of makes [ a, + {F uh, } a ] glaze,

+ A.30 utt1: that sticks to [ the, + the ] vegetables, /
% A.30 utt2: I've used, - /

sd A.30 utt4: A lot of times when we do stir fry we just put in tofu, /

b B.31 utt1: Uh-huh. /
+ A.32 utt1: cause I guess [ we're, + I'm ] not /

sd A.32 utt3: {C so. } We'll do, a lot of times vegetarian. /
b B.33 utt1: Yeah. /

o A.1 utt1: Yes, /
qr A.1 utt2: {F um, } I was wondering whether you were in favor of statehood, independence, or the status quo for Puerto Rico. /
sd B.2 utt1: I was a resident, although very young [ of the sta-, + of ] what is now the state of Alaska in nineteen fifty-nine when Alaska stopped being a territory and became a state. /
sd B.2 utt2: {F Uh, } {C so } I guess I have a left over positive feeling about the question even though I don't know very much about Puerto Rico. /
sd B.2 utt3: {F Uh, } I know that all the things that happened, relative to that territory in Alaska have been very positive, {F uh, } /
sv B.2 utt4: {C and } I have a suspicion [ that, + that ] I believe that [ a, + the ] statehood is a good idea whenever you have a territory the size of Puerto Rico one ought {C either } to make it a full-fledged state [ {C or, } + {C or } ] let it go, one or the other. /
qo B.2 utt5: What is your situation? /
sd A.3 utt1: {D Well, } [ I'm, + I ] guess I don't have [ su-, + such ] close experience [ with, + with, ] {F um, } an area becoming a state as you do. /
sv A.3 utt2: {F Um, } my concern is the economy because as I understand it Puerto Rico has a very low [ sta-, + {F uh, } standard ] of living or at least, {F um, } annual average income. /
sv A.3 utt3: {F Um, } part of this I suppose is justified [ in, + in ] that the climate they don't need, perhaps, the heating and the housing that some of the more northern territories need. /
sv A.3 utt4: However, in that case, I guess I would favor status quo. /
sd A.3 utt5: I have been to Puerto Rico [ and, + and ] found it very, very interesting. /
sd A.3 utt6: I did Peace Corps training there. /
ba B.4 utt1: {F Oh } that's very interesting. /
sd A.5 utt1: {C And so, } {F um, } {D you know, } I saw it, also as a young student /
sd A.5 utt2: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] it was very foreign in a certain sense, although I had grown up in California /
sd A.5 utt3: {C and so } the Spanish was no problem. /
sd A.5 utt4: {F Um, } [ it was, + it was, ] {D you know, } very lovely /
sd A.5 utt5: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] the people seemed very friendly [ and, + and ] nice. /
sd A.5 utt6: I have, - /
sd A.5 utt7: {D actually, } I work with, {F uh, } a girl from Puerto Rico /
sd A.5 utt8: {C and, } I guess I have never thought to ask her what she favors, {F um. } /
qr B.6 utt1: Your concern on the economy was one in terms of, if it became a state would that put even more pressures [ on, + on ] Puerto Rico, or pressures on the U. S. in terms of aid /
% B.6 utt2: {C or, } -/
sv A.7 utt1: {D Well } probably more [ on, + in ] terms of the U. S. {F Um, } /
sd A.7 utt2: {D you know, } [ I'm, + I'm ] not quite sure how the U. S. copes with this sort of thing. /
sd A.7 utt3: I've live [ abro-, + abroad ] most of my life, /
sd A.7 utt4: {C so, } I guess [ I, + I've ] been very cut off. /
sd A.7 utt5: I lived actually in Lebanon, /
sd A.7 utt6: {C so, } I was very cut off from [ the, + the ] press as I, {D you know, } [ and be, + ] was becoming an adult. /
sd A.7 utt7: {C So, } I don't know how the U. S. would cope with, {F uh, } a new state that is so very, very poor. /
b B.8 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sv A.9 utt1: {F Um, } I guess, {D you know, } we'd have a lot of aid, [ if, + if ] you consider the inner cities of {D like } New York [ and, + and ] how much aid it needs. /
sv A.9 utt2: I suppose [ the whole country, + {E or } the whole, {F um, } new state ] would require such aid. /
qy^d B.10 utt1: I guess, {F um, } we're assuming [ that, + that ] Puerto Rico would be per capita significantly more poor perhaps [ than, + than ] {D say } Mississippi /
% B.10 utt2: {C or, } -/
na A.11 utt1: I think so. /
bk B.12 utt1: Okay, /
sd B.12 utt2: that's something [ that, + that ] I guess I have not much of an image of other [ than, + than ] Puerto Rico as a tropical island and consequently large numbers of barefoot natives or something not in a (( perjuritive )) sense but in a, in a carefree sense, I guess. /
sv B.12 utt3: Although I'm aware of the political problems and unrest, [ and, + and ] also difficulties they have. {F Um, } I don't know whether [ state woul-, + statehood would ] improve their economy. /
sd B.12 utt4: [ I don't, + I don't ] know that [ the ve-, + the act ] of being a state would have any impact [ on, + on ] them. /
sv B.12 utt5: {F Uh, } I guess they would have the ability to do some taxing that they don't have now. /
sd B.12 utt6: {C But } of course if their economy is weak [ the-, + there ] is not much of a base on which to tax. /
sd B.12 utt7: I don't know if they suffer in a sense of income loss as being, since they aren't a state, whether there are monies that escape them so to speak because they aren't able to tax like a typical state would be. /
qh B.12 utt8: How do you feel, though, about, - /
sv B.12 utt9: {D well } I guess it's to their advantage to be a territory, /
sd B.12 utt10: {C but, } {F um, } I wonder how [ have, + having ] been in a territory but only as a young student /
sd B.12 utt11: {C and } my parents were in the military at the time /
sd B.12 utt12: {C so } they didn't have ready negative feelings about being [ in, + in ] Alaska at the time since they voted absentee. /
sv B.12 utt13: [ I, + I ] would imagine that it must be a little bit of a [ se-, + ] feeling of second class citizenry, {F uh, } to be in a territory that large and not being able to vote. /
sv B.12 utt14: The District of Columbia people, for instance are quite frustrated, I think, at times in their not having a Senate representative. /
b A.13 utt1: Uh-huh. /
% A.13 utt2: Yeah, /
sd A.13 utt3: those, are good points, {F um, } which obviously I had never thought about. /
sv A.13 utt4: {F Uh, } I don't know, {F uh, } I suppose they also, not being a state are probably freer to determine their own, {F um, } ways of life than they would [ if, + if, ] - /
sd A.13 utt5: I'm trying to think exactly what is imposed if they would become a state versus a territory. /
b B.14 utt1: Uh-huh. /
ad@ A.15 utt1: Perhaps compulsory education.
aa B.16 utt1: {F Uh, } I see what you mean, /
% B.16 utt2: {C so } that, -/
+@ A.17 utt1: {F Um, } and taxes <laughter>. /
b B.18 utt1: Yeah, /
sv B.18 utt2: taxes would undoubtedly be occurring. /
% B.18 utt3: {F Uh, } there, - /
sd B.18 utt4: I don't know, I don't even understand exactly how taxes are handled in a territorial situation. /
sv B.18 utt5: {F Um, } frequently the laws in a territory [ are, + are ] in some ways as stringent as they are in other states, /
% B.18 utt6: I, - /
sd B.18 utt7: {C and } I'm thinking in terms of education. /
sd B.18 utt8: {C But } then again each state sets its own /
sd B.18 utt9: {C and } I don't know how a territorial governor takes care of something like Puerto Rico. /
sd B.18 utt10: {F Um, } it's interesting because I haven't thought of them in terms of the problems relative to, {F uh, } economy, {F uh, } I had thought of it more in terms of political, {F uh, } realization /
sd B.18 utt11: {C and } I guess I had automatically made the assumption that, {D gee, } anyone would rather be a state of the U. S. than an independent country /
% B.18 utt12: {C so, } -/
b A.19 utt1: Uh-huh. /
% A.19 utt2: {D Well, } {D well } {D actually } I thin-, - /
sd A.19 utt3: one, one thing that I remember hearing in the news the past couple weeks that might be significant is that they've recently voted that Spanish is the official language, which I always assumed it was anyway. /
sd A.19 utt4: {C So, } if they've just taken such action, it would seem to indicate to me {C either } they're doing it because they're afraid they might become a state and want to declare this before they become a state, {C or } maybe because they don't want to become a state for fear of losing the Spanish, or Hispanic heritage. /
b B.20 utt1: Uh-huh, /
ba B.20 utt2: {D well } that's interesting too. /
qy^d B.20 utt3: {D Well } it sounds as though you are in favor of, {F uh, } status quo. /
na A.21 utt1: [ I, + I ] believe I would probably tend towards that. /
sd B.22 utt1: {C And } I think, {F uh, } having listened to you relative to the economy thing, I think if I were being forced to make a decision I would plead ignorance and wait to do more research before picking one of these. /
sv B.22 utt2: {C So } [ I'm ul-, I guess I'm ultimately ] in favor of status quo also at this point,
ba A.23 utt1: {D Well } that's interesting. /
+ B.24 utt1: (( leaning )) towards the statehood. /
b A.25 utt1: Right. /
qh A.25 utt2: What about [ if, + if, ] {F um, } they demanded to have Spanish as the official language as a condition for statehood. /
sv B.26 utt1: I think I would be troubled, /
sd B.26 utt2: [ I suspect, + I believe ] that any of our states, - /
% B.26 utt3: {C and } I, - /
sd B.26 utt4: constitutionally I don't think there are any prescriptions [ abo-, + ] against that decision even if Louisiana chose to go with Creole or something. /
sd B.26 utt5: {F Um, } I don't think there is any prohibitions. /
sv B.26 utt6: I would be bothered by that. /
sv B.26 utt7: [ I'm, + I'm ] bothered by any tendency to resist what I think was one of America's strengths /
sd B.26 utt8: {C and } that's [ [ the, + the, ] + the ] melting pot. /
b A.27 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sd B.28 utt1: {F Uh, } [ I, + I ] am particularly fond of a number of ethnic cuisines, /
sv B.28 utt2: {C but } I'm troubled by too close a clinging [ to, + to ] the past /
sv B.28 utt3: {C and } I'm also realizing [ that, + that ] a common language, I think, is the ultimate bond of a country. /
b A.29 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sd B.30 utt1: {C And } Canada, I guess, comes to my mind as they're going through the throes up there relative to French Quebec and whatever. /
sd B.30 utt2: {F Uh, } that [ I, + I ] think that would be a negative step to make /
sv B.30 utt3: {C and } I think that that they would need to reassess that. /
sv B.30 utt4: {F Um, } I'm troubled even in by bilingualism, {F uh, } in so far that [ it intr-, + it ] gets in the way [ [ of, + of, ] + of ] the melting pot aspect. /
b A.31 utt1: Uh-huh, /
b^r A.31 utt2: uh-huh. /
sd A.31 utt3: That's interesting because although I tend to be bilingual, Spanish based on experience, {F um, } I was in bilingual education in California /
sd A.31 utt4: {C and } I didn't have any problem with my students/
sd A.31 utt5: {C but } I noticed [ my, + my ] brother, who was quite a bit younger, was learning Spanish in elementary school /
sd A.31 utt6: {C and } he can't speak a word. /
b B.32 utt1: {F Um. } /
sd A.33 utt1: {C And so, } obviously it didn't work in California. /
b B.34 utt1: Yeah, /
sv B.34 utt2: {C but } I'm rather in favor of people being bilingual, /
b A.35 utt1: Right. /
sd B.36 utt1: {C and } I'd be quite happy to see a national law in which every student was required to learn English and a second language. /
b A.37 utt1: Right. /
sv B.38 utt1: {C But } [ I'm, + I'm ] disturbed by a country that attempts to be functionally bilingual at the official level. /
ba A.39 utt1: {F Oh, } I see. /
sd B.40 utt1: {F Um, } [ I'm, + I'm ] concerned about whether or not that causes fractiousness I guess. /
b A.41 utt1: Uh-huh, /
b^r A.41 utt2: uh-huh. /
sd^t B.42 utt1: {D Well } I think we have gone to time /
fc B.42 utt2: {C and } I appreciate your having called. /

fc B.44 utt1: Good-bye. /
fc A.45 utt1: Bye, /
fc^r A.45 utt2: bye. /

o B.1 utt1: Okay. /
ba A.2 utt1: Great. /
sd A.2 utt2: {F Um, } currently, I'm not doing a whole lot of exercise in any type of program. /
b B.3 utt1: Huh-uh. /
sd A.4 utt1: I'm mainly do a lot of walking. /
sd A.4 utt2: I have a son that's a little bit overweight /
sd A.4 utt3: {C and, } {F um, } the best thing we found to do with him is to walk around. /
sd A.4 utt4: {C So } my wife and I kind of take turns. /
sd A.4 utt5: At one time I had a fairly regular exercise program. /
sd A.4 utt6: {C But, } in the last couple of months I've changed to a new residence and everything has gotten kind of turned a little upside down. /
sd A.4 utt7: All this space that normally would be dedicated <laughter> towards the,
b B.5 utt1: Yeah. /
+ A.6 utt1: exercise area, is covered in boxes. /
qw B.7 utt1: {F Um, } what did you do when you did exercise regularly? /
sd A.8 utt1: {D Well, } I had, {F uh, } a little routine that I did for warm ups. /
b B.9 utt1: Huh-uh. /
sd A.10 utt1: {C And then } I did some very mild, {D say, } light weight lifting. /
sd A.10 utt2: Nothing, - /
sd A.10 utt3: I'm not trying to make big bulging muscles,
b B.11 utt1: Huh-uh. /
+ A.12 utt1: just trying to try and stay as firm as I can stay in my old age <laughter>. /
b B.13 utt1: Yeah /
sd B.13 utt2: <laughter>. {F Um, } right now, {F um, } I try when it's nice out, /
sd B.13 utt3: it's been raining a lot this spring, /
sd B.13 utt4: {C but } I try to, {F uh, } - /
sd B.13 utt5: I have a bicycle /
sd B.13 utt6: {C and } I like to cycle a lot. /
sd B.13 utt7: {C And, } {F uh, } my husband and I, we have entered a few rallies, that's pretty popular in Texas, /
sd B.13 utt8: I don't know,
b A.14 utt1: Huh-uh. /
+ B.15 utt1: if it's up north, /
sd B.15 utt2: {C but } every weekend a small town will sponsor a rally /
sd B.15 utt3: {C and } thousands of people come with their bikes and ride over hilly terrain for thirty or forty miles, which that's a lot of fun. /
b A.16 utt1: Huh-uh. /
sd B.17 utt1: {F Um, } {C so } we try to ride during the week to try and stay in shape for that. /
sd B.17 utt2: {C And, } {F um, } T I, where I work has, {F uh, } a fitness center /
sd B.17 utt3: {C so } a lot of time after work or maybe on the weekends, we'd go over there and lift weights and do the tread mill, /
sd B.17 utt4: {C and, } {F um, } they have stair masters and all kinds of new machine, that are fun to ride and workout on. /
sd B.17 utt5: {C So } I try to, - /
sd B.17 utt6: I'm trying to stay in shape on a regular basis. /
sd B.17 utt7: I used to, {F uh, } get into it and get out of it based on my schedule, /
sd B.17 utt8: {C so } I'm trying to stay in shape on a regular basis now, /
sv B.17 utt9: {C but } it's a big commitment. /
sd B.17 utt10: We don't have any kids yet /
sd B.17 utt11: {C so, } that's a [ lot of, + part ] of it. /
b A.18 utt1: Yeah. /
sv A.18 utt2: That's a plus. /
sd A.18 utt3: {F Oh, } I have a total of five children. /
sd A.18 utt4: I have three left living at home. /
b B.19 utt1: Huh-uh. /
sd A.20 utt1: {C And } they do take up a big part of [ my, + {F uh, } my ] evening and weekend. /
b B.21 utt1: Yeah. /
sv A.22 utt1: {C And } it's tough being a parent and doing all the things that you should do for yourself, too. /
b B.23 utt1: Yeah. /
sv A.24 utt1: It's something they don't tell you about when you're growing up. /
aa A.24 utt2: (( Yes, )) /
sv A.24 utt3: when you become a parent most of your life is going to be dedicated to your children. /
b B.25 utt1: Huh-uh <laughter>. /
x A.26 utt1: <Laughter>.
sd B.27 utt1: That's why, [ they, {F uh, } really stress, + at T I, they really stress, ] staying in shape, {D like } stay in [ fit, + ] overall fitness, {D you know, } no smoking and all that. /
sd B.27 utt2: {C But } it's hard to find, {F uh, } an actual exercise regimen that work, for you, {D you know, } because {D like } I know a lot of people that cycle, they take their kids behind them on the bikes /
sd B.27 utt3: {C and } I don't know if that would work for me because I don't know I wouldn't want to pull a kid over hilly terrain. /
sv B.27 utt4: {C But } it's really hard to find something that works, and, {D you know, } to find time to do it and stay committed to it {D like } three days a week or whatever. /
sv B.27 utt5: I think maybe walking or running would probably work because it doesn't take much time and much money or whatever. /
b A.28 utt1: Yeah. /
b B.29 utt1: Yeah. /
sv A.30 utt1: You have to, - /
sv A.30 utt2: what I found from my experience is you have to budget time for yourself. /
b B.31 utt1: Huh-uh. /
sv A.32 utt1: {C And } you can use what ever rationale you want, /
sv A.32 utt2: {C but } basically, the healthier you stay, the longer you'll live. /
aa B.33 utt1: Right. /
sv A.34 utt1: {C And, } {F uh, } {D you know, } if I spend a little bit of time each day or a little bit of time every other day doing something for me to make me live longer, {D well, } then I'll around a lot longer, /
x B.35 utt1: <Laughter>
sv A.36 utt1: {C And } those people that I'm taking the ten minutes or twenty minutes away from now, {D well, } {D you know, } get the enjoyment of me, years past where I would have been if I wouldn't have taken it. /
b B.37 utt1: Huh-uh. /
sv A.38 utt1: If you kind of think of it as a rationale like that, it works out fine. /
b B.39 utt1: Yeah. /
sd B.39 utt2: {F Um, } I've been learning a lot lately about, {F um, } - /
sd B.39 utt3: I've been reading a book by Kenneth Cooper, /
qy^d B.39 utt4: I don't know if you're familiar with him -- /
b A.40 utt1: Huh-uh. /
sd B.41 utt1: -- he was the pioneer of aerobics and all of health {D really. } /
sd B.41 utt2: [ [ He's, + he's, kind of, ] + he's ] pretty much the innovator of the whole exercise thing. /
sd* B.41 utt3: {F Um, } he was talking about the three things [ you could, + ] that cause aging smoking are inactivity, / *[[ mistranscribed? listen]]
sd B.41 utt4: {C and } what was the other one, I think was, {D yeah, } obesity. /
sd B.41 utt5: If you can control those three areas, then are you going to live longer, {D you know, } cause those are risk factors, /
sd B.41 utt6: {D so } {D anyway, }
b A.42 utt1: Yeah. /
+ B.43 utt1: it's kind of a tip. /
sd A.44 utt1: {F Oh, } I've done a lot of study over the years /
sd A.44 utt2: {C and } I found that probably one of the worst things that anybody can ingest is chlorinated water. /
b B.45 utt1: Really <laughter>. /
b A.46 utt1: Yeah. /
sd A.46 utt2: {F Um, } the research that I've done - /
sd A.46 utt3: {C and } I've actually been in the drinking watering business since eighty-three. /
b B.47 utt1: Huh-uh. /
sd A.48 utt1: {C And, } it's amazing, that, {F uh, } {D you know, } prior to {D like } nineteen-twenty there were very few heart attacks. /
b B.49 utt1: Huh-uh. /
sd A.50 utt1: There were none prior to nineteen-hundred. /
sd A.50 utt2: {D Well, } in nineteen-three they started experimenting with chlorinating the water. In nineteen-thirteen most of the major cities, /
sd A.50 utt3: {C and } after that [ we, +
x B.51 utt1: (( )) .
+ A.52 utt1: we ] started having the hearts attacks /
sd A.52 utt2: {C and, } {F uh, } Dr. Price wrote a book CORONARY, CHOLESTEROL, AND CHLORINE. /
sd A.52 utt3: You can usually find it in a health food store. /
b B.53 utt1: Huh-uh. /
sd A.54 utt1: I know they had it in health food stores in Plano, /
sd A.54 utt2: I used live in Plano. /
br B.55 utt1: Dr. Price? /
sd^r A.56 utt1: {F Uh, } Dr. Price, /
% A.56 utt2: yeah. /
sd A.56 utt3: {C And } it's amazing, /
sd A.56 utt4: he makes the, - /
sd A.56 utt5: {D you know, } it's a very small book /
sd A.56 utt6: {C and } the guys very opinionated, /
sd A.56 utt7: {F um, } {C but } he makes a very good case against chlorine. /
sd A.56 utt8: There were no heart attacks before we started using it /
sd A.56 utt9: {C and } he points out that people in, {F uh, } England - /
sd A.56 utt10: [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C or } ] even diets that quadrupled the amount of cholesterol that we're ingesting now, /
b@ B.57 utt1: Huh-uh.
sd A.58 utt1: {C and } they weren't dropping dead of heart attacks. /
+@ B.59 utt1: That's really interesting. /
b A.60 utt1: Yeah. /
sd A.60 utt2: He did some experiments on chickens whose arteries are very similar to ours.
b B.61 utt1: Huh-uh. /
+ A.62 utt1: And, {F uh, } proved that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis, which is the,
b B.63 utt1: Yeah. /
+ A.64 utt1: clogging of the arteries. /
% A.64 utt2: {C And, } {F uh, } {D you know, } he's, - /
sd A.64 utt3: there's been a lot of reports since then. /
sd A.64 utt4: This whole thing about, - /
sd A.64 utt5: first it was stress, then it went to cholesterol, /
sd A.64 utt6: {C and } now they're saying what's cholesterol, /
sd A.64 utt7: {D well } there's good cholesterol and there's bad cholesterol. /
b B.65 utt1: Huh-uh. /
sd A.66 utt1: {D You know, } it's amazing what he points out in that book /
sd A.66 utt2: {C and, } in fact, [ he, + ] everyone there was a toxicologist for the Environmental Protection Agency, who did work back in nineteen eighty-six, who wrote a letter to Dr. Price in nineteen eighty-seven. {C And } in this letter he praised Dr. Price for the work he did back in the sixties on this and said that E P A had been doing experiments on nonhuman primates and proving that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis. /
sd A.66 utt3: {C And, } E P A never published that report. /
qw B.67 utt1: {C And } what's the name of this book again? /
sd^r A.68 utt1: CORONARY, CHOLESTEROL AND CHLORINE. /
sd B.69 utt1: I'll have to remember that. /
b A.70 utt1: Yeah. /
sd B.71 utt1: That will be very interesting. /
sd B.71 utt2: My husband wants to go into medical school and be a neurosurgeon /
sd B.71 utt3: {C so, } he's really interested in the heart. /
b A.72 utt1: Yeah. /
sd B.73 utt1: {C And } [ he's, + in fact, he's ] a, {D well, } heart, too, - /
sd B.73 utt2: [ he's, + {F uh, } he's ] done a lot of research on {D like } how your heart reacts to exercise <laughter>. /
fa B.73 utt3: Sorry, /
sd B.73 utt4: he made me laugh. /
% B.73 utt5: {F Um, } {D so } {D anyway, } -/
b A.74 utt1: Yeah. /
sd A.74 utt2: [ There is, + there is ] a lot of good information out there, {F uh, } about health. /
sv A.74 utt3: {C And } [ a lot of the, + a lot of the ] myths they've been passing around, people are starting to realize aren't true. /
b B.75 utt1: Yeah. /
sd A.76 utt1: {E I mean, } I'm all for having a diet high in fiber and all that, because [ that's, + that's ] good for you, /
b B.77 utt1: Huh-uh. /
sd A.78 utt1: {F uh, } {C but } to believe some of the things, - /
sd A.78 utt2: {D you know, } {C and } I don't think anybody should be going out there and eating a high fat diet, /
sv A.78 utt3: {C but } to think that solely, alone is going to cause something like arteriosclerosis [ is, + is ] just hard to believe. /
sd B.79 utt1: If you get a chance read Dr. Cooper's book on controlling cholesterol. /
b A.80 utt1: Huh-uh. /
sv B.81 utt1: That's a real good, /
sd B.81 utt2: {F um, } he talks about that. /
sd B.81 utt3: Talks about high risk factors and heart disease and all that. /
b A.82 utt1: Yeah. /
sd A.82 utt2: I actually eat pretty much anything that I want. /
b B.83 utt1: Huh-uh. /
sd A.84 utt1: {C And } I've had my cholesterol checked [ and, + ] {F uh, } a few times /
sd A.84 utt2: {C and } I've never been above, {D like, } {D you know, } one-hundred and fifty,
b B.85 utt1: Huh-uh. /
+ A.86 utt1: never. /
% A.86 utt2: {C And, } {F uh, } {F uh, } {E I mean, } I, -/
sv B.87 utt1: You have a good ratio of good to bad.
bd@ A.88 utt1: {F Um, }
+ B.89 utt1: Cholesterol. /
+@ A.90 utt1: {D Well, } what they tell me, /
sv A.90 utt2: {C but, } {E I mean, } {D you know, } everything is {D like } within five to ten percent and all that kind of thing <laughter>. /
sv A.90 utt3: {D You know, } they leave themselves wide open so they can't be sued. /
b B.91 utt1: Yeah. /
% A.92 utt1: {C But, } {F uh, } we've, - /
sd A.92 utt2: I work at the T I site in Hunt Valley, Maryland. /
b B.93 utt1: {F Oh, } really. /
b A.94 utt1: Yeah /
sd A.94 utt2: {C and } we've had a few of the health fairs up here /

ba B.95 utt1: That's good. /
sd A.96 utt1: {D You know, } I'm not really that big on watching what I eat, /
sd A.96 utt2: {C but } I do eat, {D you know, } some health cookies that are high in fiber,
b B.97 utt1: Yeah. /
+ A.98 utt1: low in fat and all that kind of stuff. /
sd A.98 utt2: {C But, } I mean as far as really being concerned about ingesting too much chlorine, [ I'm not, + [ cholesterol, + ] I'm not ] worried about it. <<Tape fades.>> /

sd A.39 utt9: I'm [ relativ-, + relatively ] familiar with Texas school system /

sv A.39 utt16: {C and } I think the governments are working on that, to try to have some, {F uh, } businesses, {F uh, } at the borders of both sides so that [ you can, + you ] don't have this problem of them trying to come up here [ an, + ] [ to, + to ] get the jobs, {D you know, } /
sv A.39 utt17: there, there may be some organized way to do this. /
b B.40 utt1: Yeah. /

sv A.43 utt3: we see it, {D you know, } once a month. I'm sure in San Antonio they see it more often than that. /
sd B.44 utt1: {D Well } I grew up in Los Angeles. /
b A.45 utt1: Okay, /
sd A.45 utt2: {D well } you [ see it, + saw it ] out there then, too. /
sd B.46 utt1: {C And, } {F uh, } in fact, I drove a cab when I was a graduate student /
sd B.46 utt2: {C so } [ I, + I ] knew, {F uh, } the Hispanic part of L A pretty well. /

b A.49 utt1: # Yeah. # /
sd B.50 utt1: # {C And, } # {F uh, } [ it was, + it was ] pretty wild. /
sv A.51 utt1: I think [ a, + a ] common factor to a lot of problems, [ both, + ] whether it be crime, [ if, + if ] you want to jump on that, is mostly, {F uh, } poverty. /
sv A.51 utt2: {F Uh, } {C and } I think a lot of their problems is poverty. /

sv A.51 utt4: the problems we have, [ yo-, + ] [ kno-, + ] in this country, [ is, + is ] a lot of it's poverty. /

sd A.51 utt11: they're in Taiwan and Japan /
sd A.51 utt12: {C and } [ they're, + they ] haven't had, [ what, + ] that much luck in South America /
sd A.51 utt13: {C and } there's got to be a lot of potential for business down there, for the products certainly that we make and everything. /
b B.52 utt1: # Yeah. # /
sd A.53 utt1: # {C And } # there's got to be trade. /
sv A.53 utt2: I guess that's some of the answer, I guess is business, {F uh. } {F Uh, } /
sv A.53 utt3: {C and } I try to be an optimist and say, well [ that, + that's ] one way is to help any problem whether it be crime, or certainly poverty obviously [ is to, + is to ] get some business going between each other. /
sv A.53 utt4: {C And } [ we need, + we need ] to do more of that, {F uh, } somehow. And encourage more business,

b B.56 utt1: Yeah. /

aa B.114 utt1: Yeah, /

sv A.119 utt1: It's really a shame. /

sv A.4 utt1: {E I mean, } obviously [ there's <talking> [ [ the, + the, ] + the ] possibility of, {E or, } was ] the possibility of war, {F uh, } /
sv A.4 utt2: {C but, } I somehow think that war is one of those things that maybe is inevitable, /
sd A.4 utt3: {C but, } {F uh, } I don't look at it as a threat in the same sense [ that, + that ] I think this question was meant. /
qo A.4 utt4: What about you? /
% B.5 utt1: {D Well, } I think, - /
qy B.5 utt2: [ h-, + have ] you ever read the book NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR? /
ny A.6 utt1: Yes. /
bk B.7 utt1: Okay, /
sd B.7 utt2: you know, {D like, } how, {F uh, } [ these two, + there was {D like } three ] continents that were always fighting with each other --
b A.8 utt1: Uh-huh. /
+ B.9 utt1: -- right, /
sv B.9 utt2: {C and } you could picture it as being Russia versus the U S --
b A.10 utt1: Right. /
+ B.11 utt1: -- [ d-, + during ] the whole time /
sd B.11 utt2: {C and } what they would do is they would get their prisoners and kill them as soon as they got them because the people there could realize that they were the same [ as, + as ] themselves, {D you know, } /
sd B.11 utt3: the prisoners of wars [ were, + were ] the same as the people living in that country. /
b A.12 utt1: Right. /
sv B.13 utt1: {C And } you didn't want that to happen. /
sd B.13 utt2: {C And } to me, it had always been that way. /
sd B.13 utt3: I mean what happens is, you have a government, right, /
sd B.13 utt4: {C and } this government controls everything, right -- /
b A.14 utt1: Yeah. /
sd B.15 utt1: -- {C and then } you have the people inhabiting the country /
sd B.15 utt2: {C and } these people have nothing to do with the government itself. /
b A.16 utt1: Right. /
sd B.17 utt1: {C And } these people are the same as you are. /
b A.18 utt1: Right. /
sv B.19 utt1: {C And } what goes on is that every time somebody attacks a country, {A supposedly U S or Russia attacks a country, } it's not going to be within the borders of the U S or Russia itself. /
sd B.19 utt2: Like I was telling people, I'm really mad because the whole thing in the Middle East this was going on. /
sv B.19 utt3: [ In Lith-, + in Lithuania, ] [ they, + they ] were announced to be a separate country. /
sv B.19 utt4: {C But, } yet, [ the, + the ] government that's in Moscow told its army to go in there and get those people /
sv B.19 utt5: {C and } the U. S. didn't go in there and try to save those people. /
b A.20 utt1: Right. /
sv(^q) B.21 utt1: {D You know. } It's like you're not going to go in there and say no, /
^q B.21 utt2: listen, /
^q B.21 utt3: there's a separate country. /
qh B.21 utt4: Why, /
sv B.21 utt5: because you're going into the border. /
aa A.22 utt1: Uh-huh, /
aa^r A.22 utt2: uh-huh. /
b B.23 utt1: Right. /
sv B.23 utt2: Once you get into the border, then there's a threat. /
sv B.23 utt3: {C But } what happens is you don't mess with us, we won't mess with you, /
sv B.23 utt4: {C but } let's mess with the neutral countries. /
aa A.24 utt1: Uh-huh, /
aa^r A.24 utt2: uh-huh. /
sv B.25 utt1: {D You know, } {C and } now [ it's {D like } + {D you know, } they're saying ] [ other people [ were, + were ] + I guess, other leaders were ] still crazier about it, {D you know, } /
sv B.25 utt2: {D like } other people, you could think that they might use a bomb here and a bomb there, /
sv B.25 utt3: {C but } Russia has never been known for throwing an atomic bomb anywhere. /
aa A.26 utt1: Uh-huh, /
aa^r A.26 utt2: uh-huh. /
sd B.27 utt1: {C And } the U S has. /
sv B.27 utt2: {D You know, } [ it's like they, + it seems like [ [ they can, + their, ] + their ] army or whatever can, ] can go in there quicker than an atomic bomb can and [ do, + do ] the job with, {F uh, } {D you know, } less suffering. /
aa A.28 utt1: Uh-huh, /
aa^r A.28 utt2: uh-huh. /
% B.29 utt1: {D You know, } {C but } [ I think, + I think ] [ the thing is, is that there, + the thing ] - /
sd B.29 utt2: like they were saying they go, {D you know, } - /
sv B.29 utt3: {D like } Libya could start a nuclear war because of whoever is behind the button. But not the U S S R, /
b A.30 utt1: Right. /
sv B.31 utt1: The U S S R --
b A.32 utt1: Uh-huh. /
+ B.33 utt1: -- wouldn't do it.
b A.34 utt1: Uh-huh. /
+ B.35 utt1: Because they got too much at stake. /
sv A.36 utt1: {C But } I guess there was concern, {F uh, } that [ I-, + Iraq ] would use, {D you know, } nonconventional warheads [ with, + with ] the chemical weapons and things /
sd A.36 utt2: {C but } yet it didn't happen. /
b B.37 utt1: Yeah. /
qh A.38 utt1: {E I mean } --
sv B.39 utt1: {D Well, }
+ A.40 utt1: -- why not. /
+ B.41 utt1: [ My, + my ] point of view to that is, is that [ it would have had so much, + {E I mean } the attack would have been so complete ] on Iraq if they had. /
sv B.41 utt2: {E I mean } [ the first, + you can imagine the first, ] {F uh, } chemical weapon used -- /
b A.42 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sv B.43 utt1: -- that would have meant a total attack of the Iraq country within, {D you know, } three hours of when the weapon was shot. /
bf A.44 utt1: {F Oh, } {C so } you think it was fear that kept Iraq from --
aa B.45 utt1: Right. /
+ A.46 utt1: -- using it. /
% A.46 utt2: {C But, } yet the, -/
% B.47 utt1: {C And } [ what happens is, + what happens is, ] - /
qh B.47 utt2: suppose they get Saddam Hussein, which they eventually will, /
sv B.47 utt3: he's got one less thing to go against him. /
aa A.48 utt1: Uh-huh, /
aa^r A.48 utt2: uh-huh. /
sv B.49 utt1: {E I mean, } if he were to use that, he might as well commit suicide --
b A.50 utt1: Uh-huh. /
+ B.51 utt1: -- because he's going to be captured and, {D you know. } - /
sv(^q) B.51 utt2: {C But } the U. S. also makes a lot of, {F uh, } {D you know, } treaties with other people {D like } saying, okay, /
^q B.51 utt3: if you give up, then you can come live in our country /
^q B.51 utt4: {C and } we'll take care of you, like Marcos, right. /
b A.52 utt1: Right. /
^q B.53 utt1: We'll overthrow you, /
^q B.53 utt2: {C but } yet you can still come live here, {D you know. } /
aa A.54 utt1: Right, /
sv A.54 utt2: I don't think we've done that to Saddam Hussein yet. /
aa B.55 utt1: {F Uh } <laughter>, no. /
x A.56 utt1: <Laughter>.
aa^r B.57 utt1: No. /
sv A.58 utt1: I think [ [ that's, + that's, ] + that's ] not very likely. /
sv A.58 utt2: {C But } yet {D you know, } [ as, + as ] the parallel Russia is that Saddam Hussein is using the chemical warfare --
b B.59 utt1: Yeah. /
+ A.60 utt1: -- on his own people. /
aa A.60 utt2: {C And } I guess that makes sense what you said that, {F uh, } within their own borders they feel freer to do --
b B.61 utt1: Right. /
+ A.62 utt1: -- [ what, + what ] they feel necessary. /
b B.63 utt1: Right. /
b A.64 utt1: Yeah. /
% B.65 utt1: {C And, } {F uh, } {D you know, } [ there's, + there's ] just, {D you know, } - /
sv B.65 utt2: {D like } [ [ people will go, + {D like } they, ] + {D like } the U. S. goes ] and goes into Panama /
% B.65 utt3: {C and } what, - /
sv B.65 utt4: {D see } I don't believe in war. /
sd B.65 utt5: That's my thing. /

b A.66 utt1: Uh-huh. /
+ B.67 utt1: -- {D you know, } /
% B.67 utt2: {C and so } then, {D you know, } you have, - /
sv B.67 utt3: {C because } what happens is, - /
sv B.67 utt4: suppose [ I'm, + I ] go to war /
sv B.67 utt5: {C and } I'm holding a gun /
sv B.67 utt6: {C and } I'm just looking at myself holding a gun /
sv B.67 utt7: {C and } whoever shoots first survives, {D you know. } /
sv B.67 utt8: {C But } that same person also has a family /
sv B.67 utt9: {C and, } {D you know } --
b A.68 utt1: Right. /
+ B.69 utt1: -- his parents are going to cry /
sv B.69 utt2: {C and, } {D you know, } life ends there /
sv B.69 utt3: {C and } to me that's ridiculous. /
sd B.69 utt4: {D You know, } {E I mean, } I just don't believe it. /
sv B.69 utt5: I think there are other ways to fix it even though sometimes there aren't, /
sv B.69 utt6: {C but } it's pretty hard to think that, {D you know, } people are just going to shoot each other down /
sv B.69 utt7: {C and } it's legal in a situation like that. /
sv A.70 utt1: {D Well } --
b B.71 utt1: {D You know. } /
+ A.72 utt1: -- or [ that, + that ] it resolves anything in the end. [ That -- +
b B.73 utt1: Yeah. /
+ A.74 utt1: -- that ] negotiations couldn't resolve. /
aa B.75 utt1: Yeah, /
sv B.75 utt2: [ {E I mean, } + {E I mean } ] Saddam Hussein lost so much money during the war that it was ridiculous /
sv B.75 utt3: {C and } [ he, + all he ] was trying to do was make money at the beginning --
b A.76 utt1: Uh-huh <<faint>>. /
+ B.77 utt1: -- [ so + and ] keep his power, /
% B.77 utt2: {C but, } {D well, } -/
qy^d A.78 utt1: {D Well, } it sounds like neither one of us thinks that the Soviet Union is a real threat to the U S. /
nn B.79 utt1: No, /
sv^e B.79 utt2: [ I, + I ] don't think so. /
sv B.79 utt3: I think, {F uh, } [ they're getting, + they're especially getting ] their life back together now /
% B.79 utt4: {C because } a lot of things that you saw on TV, - /
sv B.79 utt5: a lot of, {F uh, } inhabitants of Russia would love to stay in their country just as long as they were able to express what they wanted to. /
b A.80 utt1: Right. /
sv B.81 utt1: A lot of {D like } dancers and stuff like that. /
b A.82 utt1: Right. /
sd B.83 utt1: They said that they wouldn't leave Russia unless Russia told them that they couldn't travel anymore and compete. /
sv B.83 utt2: {C So } it must be a beautiful country. /
b A.84 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sv B.85 utt1: It's just that, {D you know, } they won't let you get out /
sv B.85 utt2: {C and } when you want to get out of the country, that's what you want to do. /
aa A.86 utt1: Right, /

sv A.3 utt2: We have gone more into the business aspect [ of, + like I say, of, ] I don't know, working more, /
sv A.3 utt3: {C and } [ we, + I think we've ] even gone into more the labor aspect of it also.
aa B.4 utt1: Yeah, /
aa B.4 utt2: definitely. /
+ A.5 utt1: With the pay and everything, {D you know. } /
sv B.6 utt1: I feel that, {F uh, } we've missed as far as the top jobs go.
b A.7 utt1: Yeah. /
+ B.8 utt1: {D You know, } the higher echelon. /
b A.9 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sv B.10 utt1: {C Because } if you look at most corporations, there isn't a woman, {D you know, } that's on the board of directors, or that type of thing, /
sv B.10 utt2: they are mostly all men. /
b A.11 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sv B.12 utt1: There may be a few, but very incidental. /
b A.13 utt1: Yeah. /
sd B.14 utt1: <Laughter> {C And } I really think that it will be a long time, probably, before we see that. /
 sd B.14 utt2: In one sense, I'm an older person, in my fifties, so I feel that we've lost some things in the sense that women have to work today.
b A.15 utt1: Uh-huh. /
+ B.16 utt1: {D You know, } that they are not in the home by choice anymore. /
b A.17 utt1: Uh-huh. /

sv B.18 utt2: even if you want to say home, you really can't. /
ba A.19 utt1: <Laughter> {C And } a lot of times you can't, /
aa A.19 utt2: yeah. /
sv B.20 utt1: {D You know, } it's gotten to be a two income family to just survive today between taxes and the cost of living, /
sv B.20 utt2: {C and } I don't think raises have kept up with, {D you know, } a lot of the stuff, {D you know, } as far as your medical insurance and just groceries and gasoline and all, {D you know. } /
 b A.21 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sd B.22 utt1: {C So } I think that we did come a long way in the sense that [ we are allowed to vote in, + {D you know, } like you say, we're ] out in the labor force, but I think we've lost something too. /
b A.23 utt1: Yeah, /
sd A.23 utt2: my mom, she's a housewife, /
sd A.23 utt3: {C and, } {D well, } there is twelve kids in my family, /

b B.24 utt1: Yeah. /
sd A.25 utt1: She worked before she got married, /
sd A.25 utt2: {C but, } {F uh, } [ she, + {F uh, } she ] doesn't believe in, - /
sd A.25 utt3: she's very old fashioned. /

sd B.26 utt1: That's what I mean, /
sv B.26 utt2: {C and } --
b A.27 utt1: Yeah. /

sd B.30 utt1: {C And } I think it's great, but if [ you, + you ] have a family, I think you owe the family a responsibility. /
 b A.31 utt1: Uh-huh. /
 sv B.32 utt1: {C And } to have children and just get a day care or someone to take care of it, and not really have the bonding process that takes place with babies and stuff, {D you know } --
b A.33 utt1: Uh-huh. /
+ B.34 utt1: -- [ I, + I ] think that the mother and the child lose, /
sv B.34 utt2: {C and } I think that's why there is so many problems --
b A.35 utt1: Yeah. /
+ B.36 utt1: -- {D you know, } with kids today, /
sv B.36 utt2: {C because } they don't have the family roots anymore. /
sd B.36 utt3: {D You know, } I'm not saying [ that, + that ] it's totally gone, but it's nothing like what it used to be.
b A.37 utt1: Yeah, /
b A.37 utt2: uh-huh. /
+ B.38 utt1: {D You know, } in that sense. /
b A.39 utt1: Yeah, /
sd A.39 utt2: {C and } also {D like } [ my mom, + my mom ] thinks, - /
sd A.39 utt3: {E I mean } she's kind of right with it, /
sd A.39 utt4: when both partners of the marriage work, she feels that that's taking more away, /
sd A.39 utt5: that's increasing more unemployment for people that need to work.
aa B.40 utt1: {F Oh, } definitely. /
+ A.41 utt1: {D You know, } like [ for, + for ] the men that don't have jobs, /
sd A.41 utt2: [ if, + {D you know, } she feels if ] there is women out there just because they want to do it, she said, {D you know, } they could stay at home, /
aa B.42 utt1: That's right, /
sv B.42 utt2: they don't want to take care of the kids.
b A.43 utt1: Yeah. /
+ B.44 utt1: And the house and that kind of thing. /
sv B.44 utt2: That's very true, but then they shouldn't have a family. /
b A.45 utt1: Yeah. /
sd B.46 utt1: That's what I'm saying, {D you know, } /
sd B.46 utt2: I think it's great that women have a choice today.
b A.47 utt1: Uh-huh. /
+ B.48 utt1: That there are ways to prevent families, {D you know, } /
sd B.48 utt2: {D like } basically there's contraceptives and --
b A.49 utt1: Yeah. /
+ B.50 utt1: -- all kinds of ways to prevent pregnancies. /
sv B.50 utt2: There is no need to have children if you don't want them. /
qo A.51 utt1: What do you think about that, /
qy A.51 utt2: do you think that, {F uh, - /
qo A.51 utt3: } what do you think about the women that are not having families because they want to continue their business? /
sv B.52 utt1: That's fine, /
sv B.52 utt2: [ that's, + that's ] the freedom of choice. /
b A.53 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sd B.54 utt1: {C And } I agree with that, /
sv B.54 utt2: {C because } anyone who has children that doesn't really want them isn't going to be a good parent. /
b A.55 utt1: Uh-huh. /
h B.56 utt1: {D Well, } I shouldn't say they are not going to be a good parent. /
sv B.56 utt2: They won't be a caring parent. /
 b A.57 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sv B.58 utt1: {D Like } they won't have that, -/
sv A.59 utt1: {C Or } they won't be as good as they could be. /
aa B.60 utt1: Right, /
aa B.60 utt2: that's what I mean, /
sv B.60 utt3: they'll feel like it's a job. /
b A.61 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sv B.62 utt1: It's not {D like } something that they really wanted. /
sd B.62 utt2: {D Like } I had three children, /
sd B.62 utt3: {C and } {E I mean } [ I, + I ] wanted every one of them. /
b A.63 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sd B.64 utt1: I'm not sorry I had any of them, /
sd B.64 utt2: {C and } I worked third shift for a good part of my life just so I would be home with them. /
b A.65 utt1: Yeah. /
sd B.66 utt1: {D You know, } I had to work, but I tried to make it as painless as possible. /
b A.67 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sd B.68 utt1: In fact, at one time I worked as a second shift, /
sd B.68 utt2: {C and } one Saturday morning we were all sitting at the breakfast table, /
sd B.68 utt3: {C and } the kids were talking, daddy this, daddy that, daddy this, daddy that, /
sd B.68 utt4: {C and } I was sitting there. /
sd B.68 utt5: It was like I didn't belong anymore. /
x A.69 utt1: <Laughter>.
sd B.70 utt1: {C And } it was because I had worked for about nine months, /
sd B.70 utt2: {C and } when they were coming home I was going to work. /
b A.71 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sd B.72 utt1: {C And } I wasn't there at supper time or bed time, /
sd B.72 utt2: {C or } they couldn't tell me what went on at school because they would be coming in the door, /
sd B.72 utt3: I would be going out. /
aa A.73 utt1: Exactly. /
sd B.74 utt1: {C So } we were, /
sd B.74 utt2: I felt I was losing my family. /
b A.75 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sd B.76 utt1: {C And } that's why I said that's it, /
sd B.76 utt2: I either have to quit or, {D you know, } try something else, /
sd B.76 utt3: {C so } I went on third shift. /
b A.77 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sd B.78 utt1: {C And } I worked that shift for eleven years. /
ba A.79 utt1: {F Oh, } my. /
b B.80 utt1: Yeah. /
o A.81 utt1: <Laughter> Bless you <laughter>. /
sd B.82 utt1: Just so that my kids would have me at home. /
b A.83 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sv B.84 utt1: {D You know, } {C and } I feel that's very important, /
sv B.84 utt2: it really is, /
sv B.84 utt3: {C and } it's too bad because mothers miss out on so much too. /
b A.85 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sv B.86 utt1: {C So } {E I mean } in the sense that we've come a long way, /
b B.86 utt2: yes, /
sv B.86 utt3: {C but } we've sacrificed a lot to get there. /
aa A.87 utt1: Yeah, /
aa A.87 utt2: [ I, + I ] agree. /
sv B.88 utt1: {C And, } {F uh, } I really think that [ if, + ] {F uh, } like after the second World War when women went to work in factories and all that, that was {D like } out of necessity, because the men weren't here anymore. /
b A.89 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sv B.90 utt1: {C But } then it got to be a point where they got some independence. /
sv A.91 utt1: {C And } they just enjoyed the income, the extra. -/
aa B.92 utt1: Exactly. /
sv B.92 utt2: A man can afford the necessities, a woman affords the luxuries. /
b A.93 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sd B.94 utt1: {C And } I notice today kids, {D you know, } /
sd B.94 utt2: {D like } we had apartments before we had homes. /
b A.95 utt1: Uh-huh. /
 sd B.96 utt1: {C And } we had to walk before we had a car. /
aa A.97 utt1: Exactly. /
sv B.98 utt1: {C And } now kids at sixteen years old, they have their birthday, /
qh B.98 utt2: what do they get, /
sv B.98 utt3: they get a car. /
ba A.99 utt1: {F Oh, } I know <laughter>. /
sd B.100 utt1: {C And } to me, it's like we've lost our values in this country. /
b A.101 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sv B.102 utt1: We really have, - /
sd B.102 utt2: {C and } [ I, + I'm ] not trying to be, {F uh, } {D you know, } a prude or old fashioned or anything, but [ I, + I ] don't think [ if you, + ] unless you earn something and you've worked for it, and you have a sense of pride about it, - /
sd B.102 utt3: {C because } while I did this [ in, + ] {D you know, } no one gave it to me. /
 b A.103 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sv B.104 utt1: You will take better care of that, /
sv B.104 utt2: {C and } you will prize that possession.
aa A.105 utt1: Exactly. /
+ B.106 utt1: More than someone handing something to you. /
b A.107 utt1: Uh-huh. /
 sv B.108 utt1: {C And } it's just like college too, /
sv B.108 utt2: I think that if a kid goes to college, and you can help them, fine, but I don't think you should pay the whole way. /
b A.109 utt1: {D See, } yeah, /
sd A.109 utt2: {D see, } {D now, } my parents, there is no way they could afford to send twelve kids to college. /
aa B.110 utt1: Of course. /
sd A.111 utt1: {C And } so far there is only two of us that have gone, /
sd A.111 utt2: {C and } my older brother has paid his entire way, /
sd A.111 utt3: {C and } I'm on my, - /
sd A.111 utt4: I have six weeks left /
sd A.111 utt5: {C and } [ I'll, + {D you know, } I'll ] graduate, /
sd A.111 utt6: {C and } I paid my entire way, /
sd A.111 utt7: {C and } that's the way it'll go down the line, /
sd A.111 utt8: {C and } {D like } I don't have a car because I'm paying for college, /
sd A.111 utt9: {C and } if I want a car, - /
sd A.111 utt10: my parents always said if we wanted a car, we paid for the car, and we paid for our own insurance, /
sd A.111 utt11: {C and } I think that's right /
% A.111 utt12: {C because, } -/
b B.112 utt1: Sure, /
sv B.112 utt2: {C but } I'll bet your values are a lot higher, {D you know, } and your self esteem and [ the, + the ] way you, {F uh, } {D you know, } think about things is probably --
b A.113 utt1: Uh-huh. /
+ B.114 utt1: -- a lot more common sense --
b A.115 utt1: Yeah. /
+ B.116 utt1: -- than these kids that don't have that responsibility. /
b A.117 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sd A.117 utt2: {D Like } I've had my, {D you know, } - /
sd A.117 utt3: {D like } I know kids up here that have their own cars /
sd A.117 utt4: {C and } money is just given to them, /
sd A.117 utt5: {D like } they still get their allowance, /
sd A.117 utt6: they are twenty years old and they still get an allowance. /
sd A.117 utt7: {D Well, } I have held a summer job, {D you know, } since [ I, + {D you know, } I ] was in the eleventh grade, /
sd A.117 utt8: {C and } I have had to take care of my own money, /
sd A.117 utt9: [ I + ] have my own checking account, /
sd A.117 utt10: I pay for my own life insurance, /
sd A.117 utt11: {C and } I know a lot of kids that don't even know, - /
sd A.117 utt12: {E I mean } I tell them I pay for my own life insurance and their mouths just drop to the floor, {D you know. } /
 b B.118 utt1: Sure, /
 sv B.118 utt2: they probably don't even have any. /
sv A.119 utt1: {D Well, } if they do, they don't know it, {D you know } <laughter>. /
aa B.120 utt1: Yeah, /
aa B.120 utt2: exactly, /
sd B.120 utt3: {C and } that's what I say, [ you'll, + you'll ] be so much better off for it as you get older, /
sv B.120 utt4: {C because, } {D you know, } a lot of kids resent things that parents tell them and stuff, /
sv B.120 utt5: {C but } it's because you've been there.
b A.121 utt1: Uh-huh. /
+ B.122 utt1: And no one can tell anyone anything -- /
ba A.123 utt1: {F Oh, } I know. /
sv B.124 utt1: -- {D you know, } you are going to find out for yourself, /
sv B.124 utt2: {C but } {E I mean } I don't think you should just not listen to advice, even if you don't take it, just listen. /
b A.125 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sv B.126 utt1: {D You know, } there is no harm in that, whereas sometimes you can't even get that from a kid, {D you know. }
x A.127 utt1: <Laughter>.
+ B.128 utt1: <Laughter> Just attention, {D you know. } /
b A.129 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sd B.130 utt1: {C But } really, {F uh, } /
qo B.130 utt2: what do you feel the changes in the future, {D like } with the abortions and that type of thing, women in politics and --
% A.131 utt1: {F Uh. } /
+ B.132 utt1: -- president someday, maybe <laughter>. -/
sv A.133 utt1: Actually I think abortion is going to take a turn where there is not going to be as many, /
sv A.133 utt2: {C because } I think contraceptives are going to be more popular. /
sv A.133 utt3: {E I mean } I realize that they are popular now, /
sv A.133 utt4: {C but } I think, I really think people are going to start using more contraceptives /
sv A.133 utt5: {C and } with the abortion, I don't think there is going to be as many abortions, but I don't know what women will do when they get into politics, {D you know, } about abortion. /
b B.134 utt1: Yeah, /
b^r B.134 utt2: yeah. /
sv A.135 utt1: I think it will be freedom of choice. /
sv B.136 utt1: {D Well, } I still think people have a choice. /
sv B.136 utt2: {D You know, } if you can live with it, and [ it's, + ] {D you know, } your conscience is clear --
b A.137 utt1: Uh-huh. /
+ B.138 utt1: -- then {E I mean } all of us are going to answer to it one day, maybe.
aa A.139 utt1: Exactly, yeah. /
+ B.140 utt1: Or maybe not. /
h B.140 utt2: I don't know. /
b A.141 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sv B.142 utt1: {E I mean } no one has said for sure, {D you know. } /
b A.143 utt1: Yeah. /
% B.144 utt1: {C But, } -/
sd@ A.145 utt1: I think if a woman would get into politics or enough women get into politics, I think it will definitely be freedom of choice.
b B.146 utt1: Yes, /
b^r B.146 utt2: yes. /
+@ A.147 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sd B.148 utt1: Which I mean I think it should be anyway. /

sd A.149 utt2: I'm Catholic, /
sd A.149 utt3: {C and } [ we, + we ] are not supposed to, {D you know, } say that that's okay, but I really feel that it's freedom of choice. /
b B.150 utt1: Yeah. /
sd^r A.151 utt1: I do. /
sd B.152 utt1: {C Because } {E I mean } you as an individual, what you do, that to me is your business. /

% A.2 utt1: {D Well, } I haven't, {F uh, } {D you know, } - /

+ A.6 utt1: and spring break with the kids [ I, + {F um, } I ] hadn't been thinking much about the Middle East and what's going on over there. /
qy A.6 utt2: Have you been keeping up? /
na B.7 utt1: {D Well, } {F uh, } just really the last couple of days since [ this, + {F uh, } the, ] U N debate or whatever you want to call it that, {F uh, } voted on whether there was going to be a cease fire. /

sv B.9 utt2: {C but } anyway they stopped and waited to see if Iraq would accept a permanent cease fire situation though. /
 sv B.9 utt3: As I understand it, from the Iraqi point of view this current cease fire thing that the U N, {F uh, } had set up, {D you know, } the Iraqis are probably not going to go for at all,
b A.10 utt1: Uh-huh. /
+ B.11 utt1: unless they're just absolutely forced to. /
% A.12 utt1: {F Um. } /
sv B.13 utt1: {C So, } I guess, from what I understand [ [ the thing could just -- +

 b A.46 utt1: Uh-huh. /

 sv B.49 utt2: {C and } [ they, + they ] split things along, {F um, } geographical lines but they didn't take any kind of consideration into, {F uh, } social or cultural things at all. /

sv B.55 utt3: {D Well, } Iraq has had, {F uh, } designs on that place since nineteen twenty-two /

sv B.57 utt1: {C And } it's just that this was an excuse, {D you know, } to make some noise <noise>. /
sv B.57 utt2: {D Now, } something that I <breathing> read in the paper the other day that I thought was kind of interesting was that [ the Arab, + ] {F uh, } {F uh, } their version or vision or whatever the United States, now, is somewhat changed in that we won, {D you know. } /

sd^t B.3 utt1: {D Well, } Jean, the subject is jury trials /
sd^t B.3 utt2: {C and } should the jury recommend, {F uh, } sentencing. /
b A.4 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sd B.5 utt1: {D Now } my personal opinion, - /
h B.5 utt2: I don't know. /
sv B.5 utt3: {F Uh, } {F uh, } here lately it seems, - /
sv B.5 utt4: {D well } up until a few years ago, I guess, there just too many liberals about and permitting too many, {F oh, } - /
sv B.5 utt5: they just broaden the human rights [ to, + to ] cover just about [ ev-, + everybody, ] {C and } I don't think those guilty of committing capital crimes should be permitted to go spend a few years in jail and be turned lose on parole. /
b A.6 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sv B.7 utt1: It's just not right. /
sv A.8 utt1: I think I agree with that very much. /
sv B.9 utt1: {C And } therefore --
% A.10 utt1: I, - /
qy A.10 utt2: do you, -/
+ B.11 utt1: -- I think juries should be able to recommend sentencing. /
 qy A.12 utt1: Do you think a lot of people, when they are listening to a trial, put themselves in a position like that and say, I would never do something like that, /
qy A.12 utt2: {C and } it's for them to believe that somebody else could do the things that have been done? /
ny B.13 utt1: Yes, /
sd^e B.13 utt2: very possibly. /
sv B.13 utt3: So many of us have led sheltered lives --
b A.14 utt1: Uh-huh. /
+ B.15 utt1: -- that, {F uh, } when we [ go into a, + ] sit in on, a jury, - /
sd B.15 utt2: I've never done it myself --

+ B.17 utt1: -- unfortunately, /

qy@ A.18 utt1: Is there a reason why you have never,
sd B.19 utt1: I've just never been called up. /
+@ A.20 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sd A.20 utt2: My husband works as a police man, /
sd A.20 utt3: {C so } I always assumed that that was why I was never called. /
sv B.21 utt1: {D Well } {D now, } that's possible. /
b A.22 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sd B.23 utt1: {C But, } {F uh, } I was called up as an alternate once, /
sd B.23 utt2: {C but } I --
b A.24 utt1: Uh-huh. /
+ B.25 utt1: -- never made it to the jury. /
b A.26 utt1: Uh-huh. /
qy A.26 utt2: {F Uh, } do they have such a thing now as a six man jury? /
ng B.27 utt1: Not that I know of. /
sd A.28 utt1: Somebody told me the other day that there is, (( )) what they call a six man jury, /
sd A.28 utt2: {C and } I had never heard of such thing, /
sd A.28 utt3: {C and } I wondered if it was true. /
b B.29 utt1: Uh-huh /
sd B.29 utt2: <<pause>>. {F Uh, } I've never heard of it. /
sd A.30 utt1: I never had either, /
sd A.30 utt2: {C but } I just wondered. {F Uh, } - /
sd^t A.30 utt3: another question was, [ should + a criminal case, should ] the jury be unanimous on their decision, /
sd A.30 utt4: {C and } that I wasn't sure on either, whether it should be unanimous or not. /
sv B.31 utt1: <Throat_clearing> <cough> {F Uh, } {D well, } there again, {F uh, } I suppose it should be. /
qy^d A.32 utt1: That would mean they all would have to decide --
na B.33 utt1: Exactly. /
+ A.34 utt1: -- one way or the other. /
^2 B.35 utt1: Is it guilt or innocence. /
sv B.35 utt2: {C But } then again, so many times you get one or two holdouts, /
sv B.35 utt3: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] --
b A.36 utt1: Uh-huh. /
+ B.37 utt1: -- it permits the criminal to get a retrial. /
 b A.38 utt1: Yeah, /
b^r A.38 utt2: yeah. /
% B.39 utt1: {C And } there, - /
sv B.39 utt2: that's not too bad in this sense, because you might get someone in their that's a victim of circumstances -- /
b A.40 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sv B.41 utt1: -- {E I mean, } that's happened --
b A.42 utt1: Uh-huh, /

^2 A.44 utt1: Bring some of these things out. /
aa B.45 utt1: Yes. /
b A.46 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sv B.47 utt1: We can't overlook the fact that there are innocent people that do get involved in jury trials. /
sv A.48 utt1: {F Un, } apparently there are. /
% A.48 utt2: [ [ I, + I, ] + I, ] - /
sv A.48 utt3: since my husband worked as a policeman, I can't believe there are very many people that come to trial that [ have, + ] are not guilty of [ something + ] --

b B.51 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sd A.52 utt1: [ I have, + I still have ] a little bit of a problem with that. /

ba B.53 utt1: {F Oh, } that's it, /
sv B.53 utt2: {C and } you just might resemble somebody. /
b A.54 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sd B.55 utt1: {F Uh, } out here in Texas we had [ [ a, + a, ] + a, ] great miscarriage of justice. /

% B.57 utt1: We had, - /
sd B.57 utt2: a Black man was accused simply because he resembled --

qy^d A.64 utt1: When people said he was at work? /
na B.65 utt1: {D Well, } they said [ it w-, + ] [ this, + this ] happened during lunch time. /
b A.66 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sd B.67 utt1: {C And } he could have [ disap-, + ] gotten away at lunch time --

b A.70 utt1: Yeah. /
sd B.71 utt1: {C But } after nine years, - /
 sd B.71 utt2: {D well } as a matter of fact they made a T V show about it, after nine years, they finally came up with evidence [ and proved, + ] to prove that he was innocent. /
ba A.72 utt1: {F Oh, } for heaven's sake. /

b A.78 utt1: Yeah, /

sv A.130 utt1: {D Well, } I think that's where a lot of people think, boy they're getting put away for a long time, /

b A.138 utt1: Uh-huh. /
sv A.138 utt2: I always thought [ there was, + there was ] wrong, - /
sv A.138 utt3: it seems sometimes that like somebody who is stealing a loaf of bread to feed his family got more jail sentence than somebody maybe that killed somebody. /
