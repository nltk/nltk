WEATHER HURTING YUGOSLAV WHEAT - USDA REPORT
  Unfavorable late winter weather
  conditions in the main wheat growing areas of Yugoslavia
  indicate dimmed prospects for the emerging winter wheat crop,
  the U.S. embassy's agricultural officer in Belgrade said.
      The officer, who travelled through an area from Belgrade to
  Subotica, said in a field report dated March 27 the wheat crop
  had been set back at least three weeks because of a cold spell
  that followed a period of warm weather.
      He said unseasonably warm weather in late February that
  brought the wheat crop out of winter dormancy early was
  followed by three weeks of unusually cold weather.
      Damaging effects were seen in the fields, most of which
  show stands with a yellow-brown cast indicating extensive leaf
  and possible root damage from repeated freezings, he said.
      The report said that since much of the early growth in
  February was from late seeding rather than from normal
  development, his view was that the damage may be more extensive
  than some local observers say.
      The most seriously affected fields were late-seeded fields
  on normal maize soils. Stands in these fields were thin and
  chances of recovery appeared less favorable, he said.
      However, he said soil moisture conditions were favorable
  and many of the fields had already been top-dressed, which
  would aid recovery.
