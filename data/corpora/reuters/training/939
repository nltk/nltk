ULTRAMAR SELLS U.K. MARKETING UNITS FOR 50 MLN STG
  Ultramar Plc &lt;UMAR.L> said it had reached
  agreement in principle to sell its wholly owned U.K. Marketing
  companies to Kuwait Petroleum Corp for around 50 mln stg.
      Ultramar's marketing units include &lt;Ultramar Golden Eagle
  Ltd> which in 1985 made a profit of around 1.4 mln stg before
  financing and group administration charges. A small loss was
  recorded for the first nine months of 1986.
      The sale is due to take place on April 1 with the proceeds
  intended to reduce group debt in the short term. But Ultramar
  said the funds would ultimately be used for further development
  of its core businesses in the U.K. And North America.
