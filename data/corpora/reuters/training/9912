SPANISH REFINER PLANS GASOLINE ADDITIVE PLANT
  Spain's state refiner Empresa Nacional
  de Petroleo S.A. (EMP) plans to build its second unit for
  production of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), a gasoline
  additive replacing lead, company sources said.
      The Coruna-based plant, with an annual capacity of 27,000
  tonnes, and a 55,000-tonnes-per-year facility that EMP will
  start up in Tarragona next year, will make the state refiner
  Spain's biggest producer of MTBE.
      Petroleos del Norte S.A. (Petronor) runs a 45,000 tonne a
  year plant in Bilbao and Cia Espanola de Petroleos S.A. (Cepsa)
  plans to put a similar unit onstream next year in Algeciras.
