  Investor David LaRoche said he has
  extended his cash offer to buy 170,000 shares of NECO
  Enterprises Inc at 26 dlrs each until April 14. The tender
  offer was to have expired yesterday.

  LaRoche, a North Kingstown, R.I., investor who already holds
  nearly one-third of NECO's total outstanding commonstock, also
  waived a condition of his offer that a minimum of 170,000
  shares actually be tendered.
      NECO has 957,000 shares outstanding.
