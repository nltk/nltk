MEXICO SUSPENDS OVERSEAS COFFEE SALES
  Mexico has temporarily suspended
  overseas coffee sales due to falling prices triggered by the
  failure of the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) meeting
  to agree a quota system at its latest meeting, the official
  Notimex news agency said.
      "We're just waiting a while for prices to improve," an
  unidentified Mexican trader told the agency.
      Mexico has already sold 80 pct of its export coffee
  produced in the year to last September, the source said. The
  country exports about 3.3 mln 60-kilo bags a year.
