  sell its remaining South African business, Norton co Pty Ltd,
  to &lt;Global Mining and Industrial Corp> of South africa for
  undisclosed terms.
      The company said the unit accounts for less than two pct of
  Norton revenues and is being sold because "Growing societal
  pressures in the United States and the unsettled situation in

      Norton said it will provide the South Afrcian unit with
  future technical support, and products makde under that
  agreement will continue to be marketed under the Norton
