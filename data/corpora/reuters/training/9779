  The Commerce Commission has approved
  a proposed merger between &lt;Progressive Enterprises Ltd> and
  &lt;Rainbow Corp Ltd>, Rainbow said in a statement.
      The merger involves the formation of a new company &lt;Astral
  Pacific Corp Ltd> which will acquire all shares in both
  companies on a one-for-one share exchange basis.
      Rainbow earlier this week lifted its stake in Progressive
  to 52 pct from 44 pct. The statement said a new private
  company, &lt;Transcapital Corp Ltd>, fully owned by Rainbow
  directors Craig Heatley, Gary Lane and Ken Wikeley, will
  purchase this stake for an undisclosed cash sum.

  to 45 pct of Astral Pacific, Rainbow said.
      &lt;Brierley Investments Ltd>, which has been a frequent
  critic of the merger, launched a full bid for Progressive at
  4.20 N.Z. Dlrs a share last Monday.
