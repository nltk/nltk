THAILAND ANNOUNCES THIRD TAPIOCA QUOTA FOR EC
  Thailand's Commerce Ministry announced a
  new tapioca export quota of 737,987 tonnes for the European
  Community against 762,860 tonnes for the previous allocation.
      The ministry said the fresh allocation, for the February
  27-July 7 shipment period, is the third under a maximum 5.5 mln
  tonne overall quota that Thailand obtained from the EC for
  calendar 1987.
      It said the quota allocation was based on a national
  tapioca pellet stock of 4.34 mln tonnes surveyed last week, up
  from 3.05 mln in mid-January.
