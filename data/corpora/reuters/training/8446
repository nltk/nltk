EC COMMISSION SET TO DETAIL GRAIN IMPORT PLAN
  The EC Commission will decide shortly
  precisely how to arrange the import of third country maize and
  sorghum into the EC in fulfilment of its agreement with the
  United States, Commission sources said.
      Under the accord, reached following U.S. complaints about
  the impact on its agricultural exports of Spanish EC
  membership, the EC will import two mln tonnes of maize and
  300,000 tonnes of sorghum a year up to end of 1990.
      All this produce will be imported into Spain at special
  levy levels likely to be below those applying for imports into
  other EC countries.
      The sources said it was possible that the Spanish
  intervention board would be asked to buy the produce directly
  this year, as it was rather late to make other arrangements.
      They added that the choice for future years appears to lie
  between a system of regular tenders and the setting of a daily
  special levy applicable to Spanish imports.
      There will initially be no tax on re-exports of maize and
  sorghum from Spain to other EC countries, although such a tax
  could be imposed later, the sources added.
