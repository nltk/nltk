AUDIO/VIDEO &lt;AVA>SWEETENS BID FOR CYCLOPS &lt;CYL>
  An investment group led by
  Audio/Video Affiliates Inc said it raised its tender offer to
  acquire Cyclops Corp to 92.50 dlrs a share from 80 dlrs a
  share.
      The group, Cyacq Acquisition Corp, also said it extended
  the offer until April three, from March 20.
      The group said it added several conditions to its offer,
  including receipt of all non-public information about Cyclops
  that was provided to &lt;Dixons Group PLC> in connection with
  Dixon's competing tender offer for Cyclops.
      Cyacq's sweetened offer, totaling about 398 mln dlrs, tops
  Dixon's offer of 92.25 dlrs a share, or about 388 mln dlrs.
      On Wednesday Dixon said it had bought 54 pct of Cyclops'
  4.3 mln shares outstanding, boosting its stake in the company
  to 56 pct.
      Earlier today, however, the Securities and Exchange
  Commisssion ordered Dixons to extended its tender offer until
  March 24.
      Cyacq said it hopes Cyclops shareholders "will withdraw
  previously tendered shares from Dixons' tender offer to take
  advantage of Cyacq's higher offer."
      The SEC's order came after Cyacq filed suit to block Dixons
  from taking control of Cyclops and to force an extension of
  Dixons' tender offer.
      A Cyclops spokeswoman said the company had no immediate
  comment on the sweetened bid from Cyacq.
      Cyacq said its new offer is also subject to Cyclops
  rescinding any agreements with Dixons under which the
  U.K.-based firm would receive "break-up fees" or expenses from
  Cyclops or could buy Cyclops common stock from the
  Pittsburgh-based company.
