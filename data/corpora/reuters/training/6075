  Societe Generale de Belgique &lt;BELB.BR>
  said the near doubling of net profits in 1986 was due in large
  part to the sale of shares in Genstar Corp.
      The company, which announced a net non-consolidated profit
  of 5.31 billion francs compared with 2.82 billion in 1985, said
  its current profits rose by 19 pct last year, without giving
  further figures.
      However, it added in a statement that the company made
  major capital gains on sales during the year, in particular
  from the sale of Genstar shares.
      Societe Generale governor Rene Lamy told last November's
  annual meeting that 1986 asset disposals would total around 4.5
  billion francs, including the sale of Genstar shares to Imasco
  Limited &lt;IMS.TO>.
      He predicted a profit on extraordinary items of two billion
  francs after a rough balance in 1985.
      In today's statement, Societe Generale gave no figures for
  extraordinary gains.
