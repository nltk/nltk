TAIWAN'S SAVINGS AT RECORD HIGH
  Taiwan has over one trillion Taiwan dlrs
  in savings, official statistics show.
      Figures released yesterday show all forms of savings by
  individuals and public and private firms, including bank
  deposits, certificates of deposits and bond's, are running at
  about 37 pct of gross national product (GNP).
      GNP rose by 14.35 pct in 1986 to 2.74 trillion dlrs.
      Taiwan's strict foreign exchange controls and lack of
  incentives to invest abroad mean its huge export earnings are
  mainly deposited in bank savings accounts, earning below four
  pct interest each year.
