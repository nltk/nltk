U.K. RETAIL PRICES RISE 0.4 PCT IN FEBRUARY
  The Retail Price Index (RPI), Britain's
  measure of inflation, rose 0.4 pct in February on a revised
  basis, to give a year-on-year rise of 3.9 pct, the Employment
  Department said.
      In January, the index rose 0.4 pct for a 3.9 pct
  year-on-year rise on both the previous base and the new index.
      The February RPI was set at 100.4, base January 1987. In
  February 1986, the RPI rose 0.4 pct, giving a 5.1 pct
  year-on-year increase on the old basis.
      The inflation data compares with market forecasts for a
  rise of 0.4 - 0.5 pct in February and a yearly rise of about
  four pct, economists said.
      The Employment Department said the rise in the index
  between January and February was mainly the result of higher
  prices for petrol, fresh vegetables, cars and car maintenance.
