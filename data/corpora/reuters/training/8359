KLM SAYS IT IS NOT SEEKING AIR ATLANTA STAKE
  KLM Royal Dutch Airlines &lt;KLM.AS> is
  discussing marketing cooperation with U.S. regional carrier Air
  Atlanta Inc but it is not seeking to take a stake in the
  airline, a KLM spokesman said.
      "We're not considering taking either a majority or minority
  stake in Air Atlanta, but we are thinking of providing them
  with a loan," the spokesman told Reuters in a comment on a Wall
  Street Journal report saying debt-laden Air Atlanta could sell
  as much as 25 pct of its stock to the Dutch airline.
      KLM last week denied a Dutch press report saying it was
  discussing a takeover of Air Atlanta.
      The KLM spokesman said Air Atlanta's regional route
  network, centred on Atlanta, Ga, could serve as a feeder to
  KLM's international network, which includes direct flights
  between Atlanta and Amsterdam.
      KLM and Air Atlanta had been talking "for some time," he
  said, but declined to elaborate further on the talks or give
  details of the loan to Air Atlanta.
