TWO JAPANESE STEELMAKERS' CAPITAL SPENDING FALLS
  Kawasaki Steel Corp &lt;KAWS.T> said its
  parent company's capital spending in the year from April 1 will
  fall to 75 billion yen from 110 billion in the current year,
  and Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd &lt;SMIT.T> said its capital
  spending will drop to 70 billion yen from 85 billion.
      Both companies said they do not plan to start new large
  construction projects linked to production increases in the
  coming year, because of the yen's appreciation and slow world
  steel demand.
