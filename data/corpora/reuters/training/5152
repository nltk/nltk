INDONESIA DENIES GIVING PALM OIL IMPORT LICENCES
  Indonesia, the world's second largest
  producer of palm oil, has not issued licences to import the
  commodity, a spokesman for the Ministry of Trade said.
      Traders in London said Indonesia has issued licences to
  local operators to import around 135,000 tonnes of palm oil
  starting in April, but the spokesman said this was incorrect.
      A spokesman for the Indonesian Importers Association also
  denied knowledge of the import plan. He said importers would
  quickly know if licences were issued. The Trade Ministry
  official said there was no sign of a palm oil shortage in
  Indonesia.
