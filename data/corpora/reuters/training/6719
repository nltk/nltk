FAIRCHILD PRESIDENT SEEKING MANAGEMENT BUYOUT
  Fairchild Semiconductor Corp
  president Donald Brooks said he intends to take a management
  buyout proposal to the company's parent at some point in the
  future and substantial funding is available for such a
  purchase.
      Fairchild is owned by Schlumberger Ltd &lt;SLB>.
      Brooks also told a press conference that if management is
  successful, it may later attempt to take the company public.
      "I am sure that if such a management buyout is to occur,
  and I am hopeful that it does, the public market is one of the
  avenues we will ultimately have to use to raise capital,"
  Brooks said.
      Brooks also said the company would continue to attempt an
  exchange of technology and manufacturing agreement with Fujitsu
  Ltd if successful in its buyout bid.
      Futjitsu withdrew an offer to acquire some 80 pct of
  Fairchild, a semiconductor maker, after U.S. government
  officials expressed opposition to the transaction.
      Brooks told the news conference that any purchase would be
  in the form of a management buyout and not a leveraged buyout.
      He also said the transaction could be financed through a
  debt issue or conventional financing from investors.
      Brooks said management is pleased by a number of investment
  proposals bought to them, but he added, "the investors must be
  willing to invest in the future growth of the company and not
  just selling off assets."
      Brooks also said he was not aware of any direct
  intervention by the U.S. in an attempt to block the merger.
      "I am not aware of any direct contact between Washington
  and Fujitsu, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist," Brooks
  said.
      He also said Fujitsu executives remain enthusiastic about a
  link with Fairchild.
