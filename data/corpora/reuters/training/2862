NICARAGUA, ROMANIA, PARAGUAY LOSE TRADE RIGHTS
  President Reagan formally ended
  preferential duty-free trade treatment for exports from
  Nicaragua, Romania and Paraguay under the Generalized System of
  Preferences (GSP).
      He took the action after determining that the three
  countries are not taking steps to give their workers
  internationally recognized rights.
      U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter had announced the
  intended action on January 2. The United States conducts no
  trade with Nicaragua and very little trade with Romania and
  Paraguay.
