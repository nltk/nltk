VIETNAM TO RESETTLE 300,000 ON STATE FARMS IN 1987
  Vietnam will resettle 300,000 people on
  state farms known as new economic zones in 1987, to create jobs
  and grow more high-value export crops, the communist party
  newspaper Nhan Dan said.
      Yesterday's edition, received here today, said Vietnam
  would invest one billion dong, including the costs of
  relocation, in 272 new economic zones. About one third of that
  sum would be spent on export crops such as coffee, tea, rubber
  and pepper in the Central Highlands, it said.
      Since 1975, Vietnam has resettled about three million
  people from cities and crowded river deltas to the zones.
