BOLIDEN SAYS RESULTS BURDENED BY LOSS WRITEOFF
  Swedish mining and metals group
  Boliden AB &lt;BLDS ST> forecast a return to profitability during
  1987 after recording a 1.08 billion crown 1986 loss burdened by
  a massive write-off.
      The company, which consolidated the Swedish wholesale and
  investment conglomerate &lt;Ahlsell AB> this year, said the result
  included restructuring costs and write-offs of 802 mln crowns.
      "These costs have arisen as a results of a change of
  direction for the group. They are mainly one-off but they have
  burdened the annual accounts," the company said in a statement.
      Boliden said the company's liquid assets were 1.36 billion
  crowns at year-end which together with an investment portfolio
  of 1.60 billion made it one of the most liquid Swedish
  companies.
      As a result of the 1986 losses, the board proposed
  cancelling dividend for the year although it predicted a return
  to profitability during 1987, the statement added.
      Swedish tyres, process equipment and components firm
  &lt;Trelleborg AB> has taken a majority stake in Boliden since the
  beginning of this year. Trelleborg then said it had no plans
  for consolidating Boliden.
