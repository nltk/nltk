LITTLE RISK SEEN FOR TEXAS COTTON FROM COLD
  Texas' cotton crop stands little
  chance of damage from frigid temperatures expected tonight in
  that state, as very little cotton has been planted, according
  to Texas agricultural sources and cotton market analysts.
      "It's still pretty early for cotton planting. Only six pct
  of the crop was planted as of last week," said Doug Stillmann,
  a statistician at the Texas Agricultural Statistic Service in
  Austin, a division of the U.S. Agriculture Department.
      Stillmann and other cotton market sources said planting had
  begun in the Rio Grande Valley and South Texas areas only, with
  planting in the crucial high and low plains areas not slated to
  begin until next month. The high and low plains accounted for
  60 pct of the 2.5 mln bales produced in Texas last year,
  Stillmann said.
      Temperatures tonight in most of Texas are expected to drop
  to freezing to the low 20s, although the lower Rio Grande
  Valley may see more moderate readings in the middle 30s,
  according to meteorologists at Accu-Weather Inc.
      The price of new-crop cotton on the New York cotton futures
  market rallied today on weather-related fears.
