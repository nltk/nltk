TAIWAN PROPOSES FURTHER TARIFF CUTS
  Taiwan said it plans another round of
  tariff cuts, possibly within a month, to try to narrow its
  trade surplus with the U.S.
      Vice Finance Minister Ronald Ho said a high-level economic
  committee recommended tariff cuts on 66 products requested by
  Washington, including apples, chocolates and fruit juice.
      Ho said the cuts may come into effect by the end of next
  month.
      Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. Widened in the first
  two months of this year to 2.35 billion dlrs from 1.87 billion
  dlrs in the same period last year.
