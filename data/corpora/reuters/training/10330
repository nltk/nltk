INDIA BUYS 20,000 TONNES OF RAPESEED OIL
  The Indian State Trading Corporation
  (STC) bought a 20,000 tonne cargo of optional origin rapeseed
  oil at its vegetable oil import tender yesterday, traders said.
  The oil was for June 20/July 20 shipment at 321 dlrs per tonne
  cif.
      Traders said the STC attempted to buy eight cargoes of
  processed palm oil but its price ideas were too low for
  exporters. It also failed to secure soyoil for the same reason,
  they said.
