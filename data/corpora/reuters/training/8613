CHINA SAYS POSSIBLE GOOD HARVEST DESPITE DROUGHT
  China's summer grain harvest may be good
  despite a serious drought because the State Council (cabinet)
  has spent one billion yuan on irrigation and other anti-drought
  work, a Hong Kong newspaper said.
      Wen Hui Bao said the drought, which has affected Shanxi,
  Hebei, Henan and Shandong the most, has eased with March rains
  in south China and March snowfall in the north and as some new
  irrigation projects have come into use.
      "If the drought does not worsen, there is hope for a bumper
  harvest," it quoted experts of the Ministry of Electric Power as
  saying. They gave no figures.
      The 1986 summer grain harvest was a record 93 mln tonnes,
  up from 92 mln in 1985, out of a total 1986 grain harvest of
  391 mln. The 1987 target is 405 mln.
