SCOTT INSTRUMENTS &lt;SCTI> GETS QUALIFIED AUDIT
  Scott Instruments Corp said its
  independent public accountants qualified the report on Scott's
  1986 financial statements because of its weak financial
  condition.
      The report indicates the realization of the company's
  assets is dependent on it obtaining enough working capital to
  finance operations and additional funds to meet other
  liabilities, among other things.
      These factors indicate the company may be unable to
  continue its existence.
      Earlier, Scott reported a 1986 loss of 1.9 mln dlrs
  compared to a loss of almost 2.2 mln dlrs in 1985. Total assets
  were nearly 1.1 mln dlrs at year end, down from 1.2 mln dlrs
  the prior year.
