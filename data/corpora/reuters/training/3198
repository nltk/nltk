WALL STREET STOCKS/CHRYSLER &lt;C>, AMC &lt;AMO>
  The proposed 757 mln dlr deal under
  which Chrysler Corp would acquire American Motors Corp was
  described by analysts as a reasonable deal for both companies.
      Ronald Glantz of Montgomery Securities said AMC common
  stock could be fairly valued at "just under five dlrs a share"
  given changes brought by tax reform and that Chrysler's offer
  to pay four dlrs a share of Chrysler stock to AMC holders other
  than Renault as a "a good price for Chrysler.
      AMC common shares opened at four dlrs this morning after
  the Renault-Chrysler announcement, up 3/8, while Chrysler
  shares lost 1/4 to 52-1/4.
      Though AMC issued a statement saying that it was studying
  the proposed buyout and had no other comment, Glantz said he
  regarded the proposal as a "done deal" because "I can't believe
  anybody else would make a bid."
      "It's a reasonable deal for both sides," the analyst told
  Reuters.
      "Chrysler gets the jeep franchise and the (new AMC)
  Bramalea, Ontario, plant and the (new Renault) Premier
  (mid-sized car) and AMC's sales will go up because buyers will
  have more confidence that the manufacturer will still be around
  to service the products," Glantz said.
      Analyst Thomas O'Grady said Chrysler would be getting more
  manufacturing capacity, including a brand-new plant in Canada,
  for a bargain price and Renault would be getting some return
  after its prolonged loss-making investment in AMC.
