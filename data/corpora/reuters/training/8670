MAJOR NATIONS MUST ACT ON CURRENCIES - MIYAZAWA
  Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the
  time has come for major industrialised nations to take action
  on exchange rates in line with their agreement last month in
  Paris.
      In Paris, Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West
  Germany agreed to coooperate to hold currency rates around
  their then current levels.
      Miyazawa would not say what specific measures major nations
  would take, but told reporters the measures had been discussed
  in Paris. The dollar fell to a record low against the yen this
  morning, piercing the 150 yen barrier.
      Asked if major nations were now negotiating on what
  measures to take, Miyazawa said they were not as measures had
  already been agreed in Paris.
