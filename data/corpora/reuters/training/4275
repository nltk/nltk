FED NOT EXPECTED TO ADD RESERVES
  The Federal Reserve is not expected to
  intervene in the government securities market today, several
  economists said.
      They said the Fed does not have a much of an adding need
  this week and may wait until tomorrow or Monday before
  supplying reserves.
      But a few economists said there was an outside chance that
  the Fed may inject reserves indirectly via a small round of
  customer repurchase agreements.
      Federal funds hovered at 6-1/8 pct this morning after
  averaging 6.32 pct yesterday.
