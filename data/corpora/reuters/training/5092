VARITY &lt;VAT> EXPECTS 4TH QTR, FULL-YEAR LOSS
  Varity Corp, formerly Massey-Ferguson
  Ltd, said it expected to report on March 25 a loss for the
  fourth quarter and full-year ended January 31.
      A company spokesman said specific figures were unavailable.
      Varity posted a net profit of 3.9 mln U.S. dlrs for the
  previous fiscal year ended January 31, 1986 and a 3.3 mln dlr
  net profit for the previous fourth quarter. Its net loss for
  the nine months ended October 31 totaled 4.7 mln dlrs after a
  19.7 mln dlr third quarter loss tied to strikes and plant
  shutdowns at its British and French operations.
      Varity also said it would seek shareholder approval at a
  special shareholders' meeting on April 9 to authorize a
  transfer of values to the contributed surplus account on its
  balance sheet from the stated capital account for common
  shares.
      The spokesman said the move would help raise company values
  required to pay dividends under Canadian law.
