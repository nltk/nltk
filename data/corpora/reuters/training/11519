USDA'S AMSTUTZ "SYMPATHETIC" TO WOOD CREDITS
  U.S. Agriculture Undersecretary
  Daniel Amstutz said he was "totally sympathetic" with U.S. wood
  producers' desire to have their exports eligible for government
  credit guarantees.
      But he told the Senate Appropriations Agriculture
  subcommittee that including wood products in the department's
  short- or intermediate-term export guarantee programs would
  conflict with U.S. multilateral trade obligations.
      Currently, U.S. wood products are not eligible for
  government export credit guarantee because they are considered
  "manufactured products," Amstutz said.
      He said USDA had devoted an "enormous amount" of time to
  considering making wood products eligible for the guarantees
  and that Congress was considering a measure to do so.
