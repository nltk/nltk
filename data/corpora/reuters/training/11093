ARKLA &lt;ALG> PROPOSAL TO SETTLE DISPUTE
  Arkla Inc said it and
  International Paper Co &lt;IP> filed a proposal with the Arkansas
  Public Service Commission designed to resolve the dispute
  between the two over IP's plan to build natural gas pipelines
  for its paper mill facilities at Pine Bluff and Camden.
      Arkla's pipeline division, Arkla Energy Resources,
  currently delivers all of the natural gas consumed at the two
  mills.
      Under the proposal, Arkla will support IP's plan to build
  the alternate pipelines, while IP will allow Arkla's pipeline
  division to deliver an equal quantity of competitively priced
  supplies to other IP facilities.
