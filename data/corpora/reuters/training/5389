FRENCH INFLATION SLOWS IN FEBRUARY
  French inflation slowed in February to
  between 0.1 and 0.2 pct against 0.9 pct in January, the
  National Statistics Institute (INSEE) said.
      The retail price index showed a year-on-year rise of 3.4
  pct against three pct in January. An INSEE official said the
  final figure for February would be released later this month.
      After January's rise the government was forced to revise
  its inflation target for 1987 to 2.5 pct year on year from an
  initial target of two pct, after 2.1 pct in 1986.
      Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said half the January
  rise was due to higher oil prices and forecast a February
  slowing.
