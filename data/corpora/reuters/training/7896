NEW YORK STATE ELECTRIC &lt;NGE> ENDS ACQUISITION
  New York State Electric and
  Gas Corp said it has terminated its effort to acquire Corning
  Natural Gas Corp.
      It cited as reasons the uncertain regulatory climate in New
  York State and the depresed price of New York State Electric
  stock which has been caused by the delay in the Nine Mile Point
  Unit Two nuclear plant.
      The company had said in December that it had been
  interested in acquiring Corning Natural Gas.
