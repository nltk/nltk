CHINA CROP WEATHER SUMMARY -- USDA/NOAA
  Moderate to heavy rain continued
  over early double-crop rice areas in eastern Guangxi,
  Guanghdong, eastern Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Zhejiang in the
  week ended March 28, the Joint Agricultural Weather Facility of
  the U.S. Agriculture and Commerce Departments said.
      In its International Weather and Crop summary, the agency
  said The moisture lessened the need for irrigation. Moisture
  for early rice planting is adequate to abundant in most areas,
  and inundative rain in Guangdong and southern Jiangxi may have
  washed out some rice fields requiring replanting.
       Light showers in southern Sichuan increased topsoil
  moisture for corn planting, which likely is off to a slow start
  due to earlier dryness, it said.
      In the North China Plain, dry weather covered winter wheat
  in the vegetative stage, and rain is needed to meet increasing
  crop moisture requirements, it said.
      Weekly temperatures in the North China Plain were near
  normal, the agency noted.
