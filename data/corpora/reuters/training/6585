EC OILS TAX, CANADA CORN RULING OPPOSED BY PANEL
  The U.S. Senate Finance Committee
  approved nonbinding resolutions urging the Reagan
  administration oppose Canada's ruling on U.S corn imports and a
  proposed new European Community tax on vegetable oils.
      The resolutions, approved by voice vote, now will be sent
  to the Senate floor were they are expected to be approved.
      The EC oils measure, offered by Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo.,
  urges the administration to take strong retaliatory measures if
  the tax is approved by the EC Council of Ministers.
      Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn., offered the corn amendment
  which urges the administration to file a complaint with the
  GATT if the U.S. believes the corn decision by Canada was
  unjustified. Canada recently imposed a permanent duty of 85
  cents per bushel on U.S. corn imports.
