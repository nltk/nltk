SOFTWARE AG &lt;SAGA> SEES WEAK RESULTS
  Software AG Systems Inc said it
  expects to report earnings for its third quarter "substantially
  weaker" than earnings of prior periods due to an unexpected
  shortfall in U.S. domestic license revenues.

  earned 2,089,000 dlrs, down from 5,014,000 dlrs a year before.
