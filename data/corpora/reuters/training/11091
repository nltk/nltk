TEXAS WEEKLY CROP REPORT
  The Texas weekly USDA state crop report
  said stormy winter weather limited fieldwork before conditions
  improved later in the week.
      A snowstorm caused some cattle deaths in the Panhandle, and
  cold, wet weather covered many areas. Windy weather followed to
  dry fields and limit planting delays.
      Small grains made good progress despite cool temperatures
  which slowed growth. Additional moisture was needed in some
  areas. Many fields were booting and some were beginning to
  head. Wheat was rated 16 pct fair, 56 pct good and 28 pct
  excellent.
      Corn and sorghum planting progressed, and land preparation
  was ahead of schedule in the Plains despite snowy weather.
  Cotton planting progressed in the Lower Valley.
