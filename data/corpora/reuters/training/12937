  Soo Line Corp said it agreed to sell
  its Lake States Transportation Division to the newly formed
  Wisconsin Central Ltd.
      The division conducts rail operations over about 2,000
  miles of railroad in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and
  Illinois. Soo Line said in January it was seeking bids for the
  property.
      Terms were withheld, but Soo has estimated that the
  transaction will result in a one-time after-tax loss of 8.0 to
  15.0 mln dlrs.
