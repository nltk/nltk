DONALD TRUMP TO BUY CROSBY RESORTS &lt;RTB> STOCK
  Casino hotel operator and real estate
  developer Donald Trump said he has agreed to purchase the Class
  B common stock of Resorts International Inc held by the family
  and estate of late Resorts chairman James Crosby for 135 dlrs
  per share.
      Trump said he is also considering a tender offer for
  remaining Class B shares at the same price but has no interest
  in Resorts' Class A shares.
      Trump said the shares he has agreed already to buy
  represent a 78 pct interest in the Class B stock. The estate
  itself owns 340,783 of the 752,297 Class B shares. There are
  also about 6,432,000 Class A shares outstanding, but Trump said
  "I have no interest in the Class A shares."
      Each Class B share has 100 times the voting power of a
  Class A share.
      In Atlantic City, Resorts said in a statement that the
  Class B shares being sold to Trump represents 73 pct of the
  combined voting power in Resorts.
      It said closing is dependent on receipt of necessary
  regulatory approvals and other matters, and after closing,
  Trump will tender for remaining Class B shares at the same
  price.
