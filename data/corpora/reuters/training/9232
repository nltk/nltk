OLSON &lt;OLSN> TO HAVE LOSS FROM EGG UNIT SALE
  Olson Industries Inc said
  it is in final negotiations on the sale of its remaining egg
  operations and expects the sale to generate a charge of about
  two mln dlrs against 1987 net income.
      The company said, however, that the sale will generate
  substantial cash flow to pay off bank debt and improve working
  capital, eliminate unmanageable effects on profits of the price
  instability of the egg business and allow it to concentrate on
  its plastics packaging business.
