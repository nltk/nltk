HOOGOVENS EXPECTS CLEAR LOSS IN 1987
  &lt;Koninklijke
  Nederlandsche Hoogovens en Staalfabrieken NV> said it expected
  a "clear loss" for 1987.

  154.6 mln guilders than in the year before.
       Turnover was 18 pct lower than in 1985.

  of the dollar, the company said. The lower costs for raw
  materials and energy, resulting from the lower dollar, could
  not compensate the fall in revenues.

       Depreciation 457 mln vs 493 mln
       Operating profit 375 mln vs 598 mln
