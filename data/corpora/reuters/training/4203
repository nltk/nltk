PANAMANIAN WHEAT SHIP STILL GROUNDED OFF SYRIA
  The Panamanian bulk carrier Juvena is
  still aground outside Tartous, Syria, despite discharging 6,400
  tons of its 39,000-ton cargo of wheat, and water has entered
  the engine-room due to a crack in the vessel bottom, Lloyds
  Shipping Intelligence Service said.
      The Juvena, 53,351 tonnes dw, ran aground outside Tartous
  port basin breakwater on February 25 in heavy weather and rough
  seas.
