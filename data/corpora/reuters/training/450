CANADA INDUSTRIAL PRICES UP 0.2 PCT IN MONTH
  Canada's industrial product price index
  rose 0.2 pct in January after falling 0.2 pct in each of the
  two previous months, Statistics Canada said.
      The rise was led by price gains for papers, pharmaceuticals
  and petroleum and coal products. Price declines were recorded
  for meat products, lumber and motor vehicles.
      On a year over year basis, the federal agency said the
  index fell 0.9 pct in January, the largest yearly decline on
  record.
