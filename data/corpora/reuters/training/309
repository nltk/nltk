BLACK MINERS SUPPORT S. AFRICAN MINES TAKEOVER
  Thousands of black
  mineworkers roared support for a union proposal to seize
  control of South Africa's gold, uranium, platinum and coal
  mines if the owners refuse to improve conditions for migrant
  black workers.
      About 15,000 miners attended a rally here to endorse moves
  proposed by last week's annual meeting of the 200,000 strong
  National Union of Mineworkers (NUM).
      They also supported a proposal for a national strike at the
  end of this month if the owners refused to begin negotiations.
      Migrant workers from surrounding countries make up more
  than half of the labour force in the mines.
      It was not stated how the union would "seize control."
      The miners' leaders also demanded an end to the system of
  single sex hostels for migrant workers, to be replaced by
  housing schemes so that workers could live with their families.
      The crowd, one of the largest to attend a meeting since
  South Africa declared a state of emergency last June, also
  shouted approval of a proposal to work closely with
  anti-apartheid movements such as the United Democratic Front
  (UDF) which claims two mln members. They also shouted their
  support for a demand that jailed black nationalist leader
  Nelson Mandela be released.
