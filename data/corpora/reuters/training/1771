USAIR &lt;U> HAS NO COMMENT ON TWA &lt;TWA> OFFER
  USAir Group Inc said it had no comment
  on an offer it received from Trans World Airlines to buy USAir
  for 52 dlrs cash per share.
      USAir spokesman David Shipley also declined comment on
  Piedmont Aviation Inc &lt;PIE>. USAir has offered 71 dlrs cash per
  share for half of Piedmont's stock, and 73 dlrs in its own
  stock for the balance.
      Piedmont also received an offer from Norfolk Southern Corp
  &lt;NSC> of 65 dlrs cash per share. Piedmont's board was meeting
  today, but the company declined to say what was on the agenda.
  A spokesman said he could not comment on the twa action.
      A Norfolk Southern Corp &lt;NSC> spokesman said the company
  had no comment on TWA's offer for USAir or on its proposal to
  negotiate a three-way merger between TWA, USAir and Piedmont.
      "We don't have all the details," a Norfolk Southern
  spokesman said. The company's 65 dlr-a-share cash offer for
  Piedmont stands, he said.
      In its offer, TWA said as an alternative to a merger with
  USAir, it would be interested in discussing a three-way
  combination among USAir, Piedmont and TWA. It said the
  three-way merger would serve the best interests of the
  shareholders of all three companies, employees and consumers.
