PS GROUP &lt;PSG>, USAIR &lt;U> MOVE UP DEADLINE
  PS Group Inc said it and
  USAir Group agreed to move up the completion date of USAir's
  acquisition of Pacific Southwest Airlines to April 30 from
  September 30 originally.
      If the acquisition does not take place by April 30, either
  party may terminate the agreement, the company said.
      The deadline has been moved up because the Department of
  Transportation and PS Group shareholders have already approved
  the transaction, the company said.
      A Teamsters Union agreement to certain labor contract
  conditions remains to be resolved under the pact.
