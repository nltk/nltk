LIFESTYLE RESTAURANTS &lt;LIF> ADJUSTS REVENUES
  Lifestyle Restaurants Inc said
  revenues for the first quarter ended January 24, 1985, were
  17.5 mln dlrs and not the 17.8 mln dlrs it had reported

      The company also said a note attached to its earnings
  concerning a gain in 1986 on certain sales was incorrect and
  should be disregarded.
