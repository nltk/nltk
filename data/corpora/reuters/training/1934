INDIA AND JAPAN TO DISCUSS IRON ORE PRICES
  The state-owned Minerals and Metals
  Trading Corp will send a team to Japan next week to negotiate
  an iron ore export contract for 1987/88 beginning April 1,
  trade sources said.
      Japan, the biggest buyer of Indian iron ore with imports of
  around 23 mln tonnes a year, has asked India to reduce prices
  from the current average of 18 dlrs a tonne, the sources said.
      "Japan has said it may be forced to reduce ore imports from
  India next year if New Delhi fails to reduce the price," one
  source said, but declined to give further details.
