U.S. SEES NO NEW COFFEE AGREEMENT TALKS SOON
  The United States does not expect
  the executive board meeting of the International Coffee
  Organization, ICO, to call for a new round of negotiations on
  reinstating coffee quotas, a U.S. government official said.
      The official, a member of the U.S. delegation to ICO talks
  earlier this year, said no new coffee agreement talks are
  expected because there is no indication the negotiating
  positions of major producers and consumers have changed.
      The U.S. still demands, as a condition of reimposition of
  coffee quotas, that "objective criteria" be set for
  establishing quotas, said the U.S. official, who asked not to
  be identified. Brazil, the major producer, insists on quotas
  based on a traditional formula.
      The U.S. remains open to a negotiating meeting but only if
  some new flexibility is apparent from major countries, the
  official said.
      The ICO executive board meets tomorrow in London.
