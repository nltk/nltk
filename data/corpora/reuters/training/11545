WHITE HOUSE DISCOUNTS THREAT OF TRADE WAR
  President Reagan has reaffirmed his
  opposition to protectionism and his chief spokesman said trade
  sanctions imposed on Japan were unlikely to start a trade war.
      "We don't want to go down that road," Reagan was quoted as
  telling Prime Minister Jacques Chirac after the visiting French
  official expressed concern about the rising tide of
  protectionist sentiment in the United States.
      Later, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater defended the
  new sanctions against Japan and said administration officials
  "do not believe this will result in a trade war."
      "It is the first time that the United States has taken an
  action of this type and it is significant but it is nothing to
  be alarmed about," the presidential spokesman added.
      "We do not want protectionism ... We do not want a trade
  war," he said.
      Fitzwater said the president was forced to act in the
  Japanese microchip case because Tokyo had failed to fulfill "an
  agreement to make some corrections."
      Noting that there are "enormous pressures in the Congress
  and the land" for the United States to take a tough stand, he
  said, "This was a case where we felt we simply had to act."
      Fitzwater said the decision to impose sanctions was "well
  considered by this administration and not taken lightly."
      While the White House official held open the possibility
  that Washington and Tokyo will settle their trade dispute, he
  indicated a settlement probably would not come in time to head
  off the sanctions.
      "We are always open to negotations ... Whether it (a
  settlement) could occur in time to prevent this (the sanctions)
  from going into effect is questionable at this point," the
  spokesman said.
      The sanctions take effect in mid-April.
