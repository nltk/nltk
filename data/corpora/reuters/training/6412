EGYPT REJECTS VEG OIL OFFERS, TO RETENDER
  Egypt rejected all offers at a vegetable
  oil import tender yesterday for unspecified amounts of
  sunflowerseed oil and/or cottonseed oil, traders said. It has
  asked for a renewal of offers on March 24.
      Exporters said they were not prepared to offer material on
  Egypt's new landed contract terms which include a clause, "free
  from radioactive contamination." Offers submitted were on old
  contract terms, all of which were rejected.
