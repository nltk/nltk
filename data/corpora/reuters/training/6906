U.S. SOYBEANS HAVE COMPETITIVE PROBLEM - AMSTUTZ
  Soybeans produced in the United
  States face a competitive price problem because of the loan
  rate provisions of the 1985 farm bill, U.S. Undersecretary of
  Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said.
      Amstutz told a House Agriculture Appropriations
  subcommittee hearing that soybeans are caught in a "squeeze"
  because the Farm Bill allowed steep cuts in grain loan rates
  while limiting the soybean reduction.
      As a result, he said U.S.-produced soybeans "have a price
  problem" in competing with other soybean producing countries.
      Amstutz called the situation a "dilemma" for the USDA, and
  said "we have spent hours in ASCS (Agriculture Stabilization
  and Conservation Service) looking at this."
      He did not say what may be done to rectify the situation.
