FCOJ SUPPLIES SIGNIFICANTLY ABOVE YEAR AGO-USDA
  Total supply of frozen concentrated
  orange juice (FCOJ) in 1986/87 is expected to be significantly
  above year-earlier levels, even with carry-in stocks well below
  the previous season, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
      In a summary of its Fruit Situation Report, the Department
  said Florida's imports of FCOJ, mostly from Brazil, have shown
  sharp gains to date.
      The Department noted the price of FCOJ will probably be
  affected by the final decision, scheduled for April 22, on
  whether the U.S. considers Brazilian FCOJ exports to the U.S.
  have caused injury.
      Continuing strong demand for fresh and processing fruit
  coupled with seasonal declines in supplies mean that grower
  prices will remain higher this spring than a year earlier.
      The department said stocks of fresh apples in cold storage
  at the beginning of February were moderately larger than a year
  earlier, but strong demand has kept apple prices firm.
      In view of the strong demand and seasonally reduced
  supplies, apple prices are projected to stay firm.
      During the remainder of 1986/87, supplies of most processed
  noncitrus fruit will be smaller than a year ago, it said.
      Movement of canned fruit has improved, and remaining
  suppies for some canned fruit items are tight and as a
  consequence prices have strengthened, the department said.
