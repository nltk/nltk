DAUSTER SAYS NO CHANGE IN BRAZIL'S COFFEE POLICY
  Brazil will not announce any
  changes to its coffee export policy, Brazilian Coffee Institute
  (IBC) president Jorio Dauster said.
      He told Reuters Brazil was not planning to modify the
  position it held before the recent International Coffee
  Organisation meeting.
      Earlier this month, talks in London to set new ICO export
  quotas failed.
      Commenting on the outcome of a coffee producers' meeting in
  Managua last weekend, Dauster said that they discussed nothing
  involving the market.
      "In the meeting we agreed to work on behalf of the union of
  the producers in matters related to an international agreement,"
  Dauster said.
      The Managua meeting was attended by representatives from
  Brazil, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica,
  Nicaragua and Panama, the latter represented at the meeting
  merely as an observer.
