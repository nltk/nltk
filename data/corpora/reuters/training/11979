LINEAR &lt;LNER> SEES LOWER COMPARABLE 4TH QTR NET
  Linear Films Inc said its fourth
  quarter earnings for the period ended March 31, will be lower
  than the 1,235,000 dlrs or 19 cts a share reported in the
  year-ago quarter on sales of 11.8 mln dlrs.
      The company attributed the lower earnings to narrowing
  profit margins on stretch film.
      Linear also said it is increasing its stretch film prices
  by six pct effective April 15.
