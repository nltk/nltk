U.K. RETAILERS SEE GROWTH IN CONSUMER SPENDING
  U.K. Retailers expect consumer spending
  to accelerate in March after a disappointing increase in
  February, according to a monthly survey by the Confederation of
  British Industry (CBI).
      Fifty-nine pct of the 325 retailers questioned for the
  latest Distributive Trades Survey expected sales to be higher
  in March than they were in March 1986, with only six pct
  expecting lower sales.
      The chairman of the Distributive Trades Survey Panel, Nigel
  Whittaker, said a favourable Budget next week would further
  help sales during the summer.
      Figures released earlier this week showed retail sales in
  January fell 2.2 pct, mainly due to exceptionally cold weather.
      "Sales did not recover in February as much as retailers had
  expected, and they are now looking for better business in
  March," today's survey said.
      It reported clothing stores were the most optimistic, with
  80 pct expecting sales in March to be higher than a year ago.
      Wholesalers also expected stronger sales in March, while
  both retailers and wholesalers reported slower growth in import
  penetration, it said.
