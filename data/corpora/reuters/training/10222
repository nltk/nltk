MEDIA GENERAL &lt;MEG.A> UPS DIVIDEND, SETS SPLIT
  Media General Inc said it raised
  the annual dividend on its class A and class B common stock to
  68 cts a share from 64 cts.
      The company said it also declared a two-for-one stock split
  of both stock issues, which is subject to shareholder approval
  of an increase in the number of authorized class A shares.
      Media General said the increased dividend is payable June
  12 to shareholders of record May 29.
      The proposed stock split will be paid May 29 in shares of
  class A shares, the company said.
      The company said it also approved an amendment to its
  articles of incorporation allowing class B shares to be
  coverted into class A shares at the option of the holder.
      Media General said the moves should broaden investor
  interest in its class A stock.
