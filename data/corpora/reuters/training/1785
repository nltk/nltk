PERU SUGAR HARVEST SEEN LOWER -- USDA
  Sugar production in Peru for the
  1986/87 season has been revised to 593,000 tonnes (raw value),
  down 10 pct from the previous forecast and 21 pct below the
  1985/86 harvest, the U.S. Agriculture Department said in its
  World Production and Trade Report.
      It said while rains in the northern mountain region are
  improving the supply of irrigation water, the major benefits
  will not occur until the 1987/88 season.
