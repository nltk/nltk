FRANK B. HALL &lt;FBH> EARNINGS REPORT QUALIFIED
  Frank B. Hall and Co Inc
  said its independent accountants will issue a qualified report
  on its financial statements.
      The company said the opinion is the result of ongoing
  litigation over its discontinued operations. Earlier it said it
  lost 2.1 mln dlrs in the fourth quarter against a loss of 2.3
  mln dlrs a year ago before discontinued operations.
      It also said it decided to sell its claims adjusting and
  admininistrative operations and its automobile dealer insurance
  unit, creating a reserve of about nine mln dlrs in the fourth
  quarter 1986 for the sale.
      The company said it will vigorously defend the litigation
  arising from the discontinued units.
      It also said it will concentrate on its direct brokerage
  and service business.
