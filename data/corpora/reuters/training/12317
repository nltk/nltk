GENCORP TAKES NO ACTION ON STOCK DIVIDEND
  Gencorp Inc said its board took no
  action with respect to a two pct stock dividend at its annual
  meeting yesterday due to the press of other business,
  specifically the company's pending takeover offer by General
  Acquisition Corp, formed by AFG industries inc and Wagner and
  brown.
      A spokesman said the two pct stock dividend, normally
  issued everly year, was not issued in February because the
  company was examining other dividend alternatives. Management
  said it would give consideration to this matter at a later
  time.
     Yesterday, the company's chairman, A. William Reynolds, told
  shareholders he would be presenting an alternative to the 100
