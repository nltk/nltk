SOSNOFF HAS SMALL NUMBER OF CAESARS &lt;CAW> SHARES
  Martin T. Sosnoff said his &lt;MTS
  Acquisition Corp> to date has received only a "negligible"
  number of Caesars World Inc shares in response to its 28-dlr-
  per-share tender offer for all shares.
      Sosnoff also said he has held preliminary talks with Pratt
  Hotel Corp &lt;PRAT> and Southmark Corp &lt;SM> on forming a joint
  venture to enter into talks to acquire Caesars in a friendly
  transaction in which Sosnoff would have a 50 pct interest and
  Pratt and Southmark the remainder.
      Sosnoff said the talks with Pratt and Southmark are not
  being actively pursued at the presentand may or may not be
  continued in the future.  He said there could be no assurance
  that a joint venture would be formed or that Caesars would
  agreed to talks.  "Several preliminary contacts with
  representatives of Caesars have not resulted in any indication
  that it wishes to enter into such negotiations," Sosnoff said.
      He said based on talks with staff members of gaming
  authorities, there can be no assurance that the necessary
  regulatory review of its bid for Caesars World can be completed
  by the original April Three expiration date.
      Sosnoff said it has extended the tender until May 15.  The
  bid remains subject to regulatory approvals and the arrangement
  of financing.
      Pratt, which owns the Sands Hotel and Casino in Atlantic
  City, N.J., where Caesars operates the Boardwalk Regency Hotel
  and Casino, recently waged an apparently unsuccessful campaign
  to acquire control of Resorts International Inc &lt;RTA> against
  New York developer Donald Trump.  Southmark owns about 37 pct
  of Pratt Hotel.
      Caesars World's boasrd has urged rejection of the offer on
  the grounds that it is inadequate and has said it would
  investigate alternative transactions.  Sosnoff currently owns
  about 13.3 pct of Caesars World.
