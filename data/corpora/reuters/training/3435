AUSTRALIAN RESERVE BANK IN BUYING INTERVENTION
  The Reserve Bank said at 1230 local time
  it was offering to buy short-dated government securities in the
  short-term money market.
      The bank's action followed its purchase of short-dated
  government stock and six-day repurchase agreements earlier in
  the session.
      Money market traders said the move was aimed at easing cash
  market interest rates which had risen on demand for funds to
  meet PAYE tax and treasury note settlement commitments.
