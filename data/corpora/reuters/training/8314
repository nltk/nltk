BAYERNVEREIN EXPECTS UNCHANGED DIVIDEND FOR 1987
  Bayerische Vereinsbank AG &lt;BVMG.F>
  expects to pay an unchanged dividend of 13 marks on 1987
  earnings but profits will only barely reach last year's record
  levels, management board spokesman Maximilian Hackl said.
      He told the annual news conference that possible credit
  risks, especially those associated with foreign nations, had
  largely been covered. Risk provisions in 1987 were therefore
  unlikely to reach the same high level as in 1986.
      Group bank net profit rose to 275.52 mln marks in 1986 from
  222.73 mln the previous year and parent bank net profit
  increased to 187.63 mln marks from 161.58 mln.
      Hackl said that interest margins in the banking business
  had declined to 2.71 pct last year from 2.78 pct the previous
  year. But in the mortgage sector, the margins had increased
  slightly and stood around 0.7 pct.
      Parent bank commission surplus in the securities business
  had risen almost 15 pct to 358 mln marks in 1986.
      Expenses for personnel had increased 7.5 pct to 782 mln
  marks and others costs had increased 9.4 pct to 272 mln marks.
      The parent bank's 1986 partial operating profit, which
  excludes earnings from trading on its own account, had climbed
  two pct to 671 mln marks.
      The parent bank's balance sheet total rose 5.3 pct to 81.5
  billion marks at end-1986 compared with end-1985, Hackl said.
      It was boosted by a three billion mark rise in mortgage
  business and a 1.1 billion mark increase in banking business.
      The mortgage sector's share in total parent bank business
  volume rose to 46 pct from 45.
      Hackl said that in January and February this year, the
  bank's credit business had not livened up. But despite the
  sharp downturn on German bourses, profits from trading on own
  account had increased in the first two 1987 months compared
  with the same year-ago period. He gave no detailed figures.
