THATCHER SAYS TRADE TARGETS SET WITH MOSCOW
  British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
  said she and Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov had set targets for
  increased trade between the two countries during talks earlier
  today.
      She said she hoped more economic exchanges between Britain
  and the Soviet Union "will also lead to increased friendship and
  increased understanding."
      Earlier, she told a meeting of Soviet and British
  businessmen that she had agreed with Ryzhkov that they would
  work to achieve a total volume of 2.5 billion roubles in
  bilateral trade by 1990.
      This would entail an increase by each side of 350 to 400
  mln stg over their present export levels.
      "Mr Ryzhkov handed me a list of import and export
  opportunities which I hope you will all jump at," she told the
  meeting to mark the opening of new offices of the British-
  Soviet Chamber of Commerce.
      After her talks with Ryzhkov, Thatcher and the Soviet
  Premier were joined for the signing of agreements covering new
  scientific and cultural exchanges by Kremlin leader Mikhail
  Gorbachev, who had nine hours of talks with her yesterday.
