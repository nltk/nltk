SWISS CONSUMER PRICES RISE ONE PCT IN MARCH
  Swiss consumer prices rose one pct in the
  year to March, the same rise as in the year to February, and
  against 0.9 pct in the year to March 1986, the Federal
  Statistics Office said.
      In March alone, prices rose 0.1 pct after a 0.3 pct rise in
  February.
      The March index, base 1982, was 109.7 against 109.5 in
  February.
      The Statistics Office said the March increase reflected
  rises in certain sectors such as food, clothing and household
  goods and falls in transport, heating and lighting.
      Both home produced and imported goods rose by 0.1 pct
  during the month. But over the year as a whole, domestically
  generated inflation reached 2.5 pct, offset by a 2.8 pct drop
  in imports.
