TWA &lt;TWA> SUES USAIR &lt;U> OVER POISON PILL
  Trans World Airlines Inc said it filed
  suit in Delaware Chancery Court against USAir Group Inc and its
  board of directors seeking to invalidate its "poison pill"
  anti-takeover plan.
      TWA vice president and general counsel Mark Buckstein said
  TWA also sought a declaratory judgement from the court that its
  52 dlr per share takeover offer for USAir would in no way
  interfer with USAir's possible buyout of Peidmont Aviation Inc
  &lt;PIE>.
      Buckstein said TWA asked the court to enjoin the
  enforcement of USAir's shareholder rights plan, or "poison
  pill." Such provisions, which typically allow for the issue of
  securities to shareholders in the event of a hostile takeover
  bid, are aimed at deterring takeovers by making them more
  expensive.
      USAir earlier today rejected TWA's offer, saying TWA's bid
  was an attempt to interfer with its buyout of Piedmont.
      USAir also had said its counsel would investigate the
  matter. Tonight, a spokesman for USAir said the airline had no
  comment on TWA's lawsuit.
      USAir did respond, however, to a TWA request to the
  Department of Transportation for permission to buy up to 51 pct
  of USAir stock and place the stock in a voting trust pending
  approval of a takeover.
      USAir said the request was "hastily pasted together in
  order to take advantage of a regulatory anamoly that would
  allow TWA to accomplish in a regulated environment actions that
  would be impermissable in the non-regulated economy at large."
      USAir called on the transportation department to reject
  TWA's request.
