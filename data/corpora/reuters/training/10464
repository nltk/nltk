FED EXPECTED TO ADD RESERVES, ECONOMISTS SAY
  The Federal Reserve is expected to
  enter the U.S. government securities market to add reserves
  today, economists said.
      They said the Fed would probably supply temporary reserves
  indirectly by arranging one to two billion dlrs of customer
  repurchase agreements.
      After averaging 6.21 pct yesterday, federal funds were
  opened at 6-1/8 pct and remained at that level.
