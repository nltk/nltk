EC APPROVES 25,000 TONNES OF BARLEY EXPORTS
  The European Community authorised the
  export of 25,000 tonnes of barley yesterday, bringing the
  cumulative total at weekly tenders since the series started
  last June to 3.33 mln tonnes, close to the 3.37 mln under
  licence in the same year ago period, traders said.
      All bids for wheat were rejected. However, the total to
  date of 5.06 mln tonnes is still substantially more than the
  3.03 mln under licence a year ago. The 80,000 tonnes of French
  maize granted for export moved the total to 135,000 tonnes
  since the tender opened in February this year. There were no
  facilities for maize in the previous weekly grain export
  series.
