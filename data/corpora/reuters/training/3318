MEATPACKERS STRIKE MORRELL SIOUX CITY PLANT
  About 800 members of the United Food and
  Commercial Workers Union, UFCWU, struck John Morrell's Sioux
  City, Iowa, pork processing plant at midnight Sunday, a
  spokesman for the UFCWU national said.
      Meatpackers at the plant have been working without a
  contract since the old pact expired January 31, UFCWU spokesman
  John Mancuso said. The plant can slaughter and process about
  13,000 to 14,000 hogs a day, he estimated.
      The UFCWU bargaining committee and full membership rejected
  in late January a contract proposal by John Morrell, a
  subsidiary of United Brands Inc, he said.
