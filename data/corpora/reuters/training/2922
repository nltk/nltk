U.S. FARM PROGRAMS HELP CANADIAN CORN PRODUCERS
  An American Farm Bureau
  Federation (AFBF) official said that far from hurting Canadian
  corn producers, U.S. farm programs benefit all foreign
  producers.
      AFBF president Dean Kleckner made the comments in response
  to the ruling earlier today by the Canadian Import Tribunal
  that subsidized U.S. corn imports were injurious to Canadian
  growers. The tribunal upheld a countervailing duty of 84.9 U.S.
  cents a bushel.
      "Farm Bureau specialists went to Ottawa and testified
  previous U.S. farm programs have actually benefited all foreign
  producers by reducing the amount of corn grown in the U.S. (and
  losing market share), while exerting an upward influence on the
  price of corn Worldwide," he said.
