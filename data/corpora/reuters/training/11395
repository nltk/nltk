ROCKY MOUNT &lt;RMUC> EXPECTS PROFIT IN FIRST QTR
  Hal Weiss, chairman,
  president and chief executive officer, of Rocky Mount
  Undergarment Co Inc, said he expects the company to show a
  profit for the first quarter fiscal 1987.
      Weiss said sales for 1987 have been strong following a net
  loss of 1,548,000 dlrs, or 53 cts a share, for the fourth
  quarter of fiscal 1986. The company reported a net loss for the
  year of 2,408,000 dlrs, or 82 cts a share.
      Rocky Mount recorded net income of 248,000 dlrs, or eight
  cts per share, for the first quarter of fiscal 1986.
      Weiss attributed the poor year to problems involving
  management, manufacturing operations, financial condition and
  credibility among its suppliers.
      Weiss predicted the pattern of quarterly lossses which
  characterized 1986 will be reversed and 1987 will see the
  company return to profitability.
