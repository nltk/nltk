NEW EEP DURUM WHEAT OFFER TO ALGERIA -- USDA
  U.S. exporters will have the
  opportunity to sell an additional 300,000 tonnes of U.S. durum
  wheat to Algeria under the Export Enhancement Program, EEP, the
  U.S. Agriculture Department said.
      The department said the sales will be subsidized with
  commodities from the Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC,
  inventory and the subsidy will enable U.S. exports to compete
  at commercial prices in the Algerian market.
      Algeria has already purchased 300,000 tonnes of U.S. durum
  wheat under a previous export enhancement initiative announced
  November 10, 1986, it said.
      Details of the latest initiative, including an invitation
  for offers from exporters, will be issued in the near future,
  the department said.
