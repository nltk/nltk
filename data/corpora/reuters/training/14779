BANK OF JAPAN INTERVENES SOON AFTER TOKYO OPENING
  The Bank of Japan bought a small amount of
  dollars shortly after the opening at around 145.30 yen, dealers
  said.
      The central bank intervened as a medium-sized trading house
  sold dollars, putting pressure on the U.S. Currency, they said.
      The dollar was also supported by a major electrical
  consumer goods company, which was a speculative dollar buyer at
  around 145.25 yen, they added.
      The dollar opened at 145.33 yen against 145.60/70 in New
  York and 145.25 at the close here yesterday.
