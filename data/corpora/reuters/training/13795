SPAIN TO SELL BARLEY TO SAUDI ARABIA
  Spain will shortly sign with Saudi Arabia
  an order for barley for April/May delivery, trade sources said.
      They gave no details on amounts or prices, but said it
  would be a "major" order.
      Saudi Arabia bought 500,000 tonnes of Spanish barley last
  year.
