  The Australian Wheat Board (AWB)
  expects to sell about 900,000 tonnes of wheat to the Japanese
  Food Agency this year after renewing its annual supply
  agreement, AWB general manager Ron Paice said.
      Under the agreement, the AWB makes the wheat available and
  sells into the Food Agency's regular tenders, he said in a
  statement.
      He noted that the Board has sold more than three mln tonnes
  to Japan in the past three years.
