MINISTER PREDICTS ONE PCT INFLATION FOR SINGAPORE
  Singapore will have an inflation rate
  of one pct in 1987, up from a negative 1.4 pct in 1986, Trade
  and Industry Minister Lee Hsien Loong told Parliament.
      He said the 1986 drop in the inflation rate, the first fall
  in a decade, was due largely to lower world prices for oil and
  oil-related items.
      But Lee said the negative inflation rate is unlikely to be
  repeated this year because of projected higher prices for
  primary commodities and oil.
