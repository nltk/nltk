  Swiss capital exports rose to 4.64
  billion francs in January after 2.54 billion in December and a
  year earlier 3.64 billion, the Swiss National Bank said.
      New bond issues accounted for 4.12 billion of the total
  after December's 2.15 billion, and credits 525.1 mln after

  billion francs, notes 1.39 billion and credits 597.5 mln.
