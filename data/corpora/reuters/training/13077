GENCORP &lt;GY> UNIT COMPLETES WOR-TV SALE
  GenCorp said its RKO General Inc
  subsidiary completed the sale of WOR-TV to MCA Inc &lt;MCA> for
  387 mln dlrs.
      The Federal Communications Commission approved the sale
  last December, GenCorp said. The closing was delayed because
  that decision was appealed by four parties to the U.S. Court of
  Appeals, GenCorp explained.
      WOR-TV is based in  Secaucus, N.J., GenCorp said.
      Earlier today, &lt;General Partners> said it was prepared to
  raise its bid to 110 dlrs per share, or even more, in its bid
  for GenCorp.
