GEONEX SEES SALES HURT BY PRODUCTION SHIFT
  Geonex Corp &lt;GEOX> said
  BellSouth Corp &lt;BLS> unit Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph
  Co's decision to postpone the start up of new conversion
  assignments at Geonex's Chicago Aerial Survey unit could
  negatively affect its fiscal 1987 revenues.
      The company said it had expected higher revenues from the
  records conversion work, but it now foresees revenues from
  Southern Bell work at about eight mln dlrs, the same level as
  last fiscal year.
      Geonex said Southern Bell will let CAS continue work in
  progress and it expects to perform mechanized posting and
  records conversion for Southern Bell through 1989.
      But, it added that the Southern Bell decision has forced it
  to pursue opportunities with other telephone companies and
  municipalities to replace the Southern Bell work.
