ROGERS &lt;ROG> ADOPTS RIGHTS PLAN
  Rogers Corp said its board
  approved a shareholder rights plan designed to protect its
  shareholders in the event of an attempted hostile takeover.
      Rogers said the plan is not being adopted in response to
  any specific takeover attempt.
      Under the plan, shareholders may buy one share of common
  stock at 65 dlrs for each share held. The rights will be
  exercisable only if a person or group acquires 20 pct or more
  of Rogers' shares or announces an offer for 30 pct or more.
      The dividend distribution will be made March 30 to holders
  or record on that date.
