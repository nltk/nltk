HOUSE 0/92 FARM PLAN MARKUP DELAYED TILL TUESDAY
  A House Agriculture Committee meeting
  to draft a disaster aid bill containing a controversial 0/92
  provision has been postponed until next Tuesday, committee
  staff members announced.
      The bill contains a provision implementing a 0/92 acreage
  reduction plan for 1986 wheat and 1987 winter wheat, thereby
  making payments available to farmers who were not able to plant
  last year's winter wheat crop because of flooding.
      Controversy exists over whether the 0/92 provisions of the
  bill should be expanded, cut back or left as is.
