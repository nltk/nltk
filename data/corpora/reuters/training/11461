U.S.-JAPAN NOT IN TRADE WAR, YEUTTER SAYS
  The United States and Japan are not
  involved in a trade war, despite U.S. sanctions announced last
  week against Japanese semiconductors, U.S. Trade Representative
  Clayton Yeutter said.
      "In my judgement, we're not even close to a trade war,"
  Yeutter told a House Agriculture Committee hearing.
      Yeutter said if Japan takes action to honor its agreement
  with the U.S. on semiconductor trade, "Then the retaliatory
  response will last a relatively short period."
      Yeutter said Japan must stop dumping chips in third
  countries and buy more American computer chips.
