FORD &lt;F> NEARS GM &lt;GM> IN EXECUTIVE BONUSES
  Ford Motor Co neared General Motors
  Corp last year in executive bonuses, while it topped the larger
  automaker in profit sharing payments to workers.
      Ford, which outstripped GM in earnings last year, said its
  1986 incentive bonuses totaled 167 mln dlrs, slightly behind
  General Motors' 169.1 mln.
      General Motors, however, did not make any profit-sharing
  payments to its workers, while Ford made a profit-sharing
  distribution of 372 mln dlrs, or 2,100 dlrs per worker.
      General Motors, which saw its earnings drop to 2.94 billion
  dlrs from 1985's 3.99 billion, said the 1986 profit was "not
  sufficient to generate a payout under the profit-sharing
  formula."
      Ford, which earned 3.28 billion dlrs in 1986, up from 2.51
  billion in 1985, said it "recognizes employees' efforts and
  fulfills its commitment to them in many ways, including
  profit-sharing."
