USDA DENIES CHANGES IN TEXAS GULF DIFFERENTIALS
  No changes have been made or are
  being planned in the Agriculture Department's calculation of
  price differentials between interior grain locations and the
  Texas Gulf, a senior USDA official said.
      Ralph Klopfenstein, USDA deputy administrator for commodity
  operations, told Reuters, "We do not anticipate any changes to
  be made" in the Texas Gulf differentials used to calculate
  posted county prices for corn.
      "We do not relate the Texas Gulf structure with the
  Louisiana Gulf structure at all. It's a totally different
  situation," he said.
      Rumors had circulated through the market this morning that
  USDA had widened Texas Gulf differentials in a similar manner
  to last weekend's adjustments with the Louisiana Gulf.
