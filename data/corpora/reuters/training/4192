GENERAL MINING (GENM.J) CAUTIONS ON 1987 PROFITS
  General Mining Union Corp Ltd
  chairman Derek Keys cautioned that profits may not rise this
  year if the rand stays at its current level of 48 U.S. Cents.
      "We would do well to repeat last year's results if the rand
  stays depressed," Keys said.
      The level of the dividend, however, "ought not to be
  affected," he added, discussing the 1987 outlook.
      General Mining earlier reported that 1986 per share
  earnings rose 28 pct to 616 cts.
