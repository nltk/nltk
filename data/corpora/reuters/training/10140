DECISION INDUSTRIES &lt;DIC> SEES 1ST QTR LOSS
  Decision Industries Corp said it
  expects to report an operating loss of 19-24 cts a share for
  the first quarter ending March 31 mainly due to lower profit
  margins and higher sales and marketing costs.
      In the 1st quarter of last year, when the company's quarter
  ended Feb 28, 1986, it earned 957,000 dlrs or 10 cts a share on
  revenues of 45 mln dlrs.
      Decision also said it entered into an agreement to sell its
  International Computerized Telemarketing Inc subsidiary to an
  investor group headed by the unit's senior management. Terms
  were not disclosed.
      Decision also said it consolidated its Decision Development
  Corp subsidiary into Decision Data Computer Corp, the unit
  which designs, manufactures and sells its System/3X peripheral
  products.
      It said this restructuring will adversely affect its first
  quarter earnings, but it said it expects to realize a
  "significant savings" in operating expenses through the
  remainder of the year.
