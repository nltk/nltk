  &lt;Avia Group International Inc> 
  stockholders filed a class a action suit in Multnomah County
  Circuit court seeking to halt the sale of Avia to Reebok
  International Ltd &lt;RBOK>.
      Avia stockholders also seek to receive compensation from
  the defendants, who include most of Avia directors, according
  to court papers.
      The suit grew out a meeting of several dozen dissatisfied
  minority stockholders of Avia following the announcement of
  Reebok's proposed acquisition of Avia and the sudden drop in
  the price of Avia stock.
      The complaint was filed on behalf of Clem Eischen, a
  Portland-area resident, who owns 500 shares of Avia, and Robert
  Withers, also of the Portland-area, who owns 954 shares, and
  other individuals who held stock at the time of Reebok's
  announcement. A jury trial has been requested.
      "The actions of the small group that contral Avia have hurt
  the little guy," said Eischen.
      The stockholders, according to a statement, have organized
  a steering committee.
      The complaint reviews the price action of Avia stock from
  March 1986 and noted the plaintifs who purchased stock between
  19 dlrs and 25 dlrs per share. The price fell from 24 dlrs to
  16.50 dlrs a share following the Reebok announcement.
      The complaint asked the defendants be enjoined from
  proceeding with the Reebok acquisition of Avia. It also
  requests damages to be determined at the time of trial.
      Avia said it had not seen the court papers and said it had
  no comment on the suit.
