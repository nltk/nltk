  with the company's independent legal and financial advisers,
  American Motors said in a statement issued from New York.
      American Motors' board voted to postpone its annual
  shareholders meeting scheduled for April 29 in Southfield,
  Michigan.

  board will be April 29, although it is expected that directors
  will meet again prior to that date, according to the statement.
