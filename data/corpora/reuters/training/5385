LOWRANCE ELECTRONICS &lt;LEIX> SEES ORDERS OFF
  Lowrance Electronics Inc said
  results from operations in the third and fourth quarter may not
  be comparable to the first and second quarters, which were
  strong because of orders for new sonar equipment.
      For the six months ended Jan 31, the company reported net
  income almost tripled to 951,000 dlrs or 34 cts a share as
  sales rose 38 pct to 20.6 mln dlrs.
      The company, which went public Dec 23, also said it expects
  to be able to fill back orders from the first two quarters
  because of improved supply of computer chip components.
