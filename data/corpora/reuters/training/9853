GERMAN ANALYSTS SEE GOLD FIRMING LATER THIS YEAR
  The price of gold bullion is likely
  to rise in the second half of the year on increased private
  investor demand, West German analysts said.
      Gold could rise as high as 500 dlrs per ounce later this
  year, said Peter Witte, director of Westdeutsche Landesbank
  Girozentrale's trading division, after a presentation by the
  U.S. Mint to promote its gold and silver Eagle series coins.
      "A lot will depend on oil prices and developments on stock
  exchanges," Witte said, adding he saw gold positioned for
  further rises once it breaks out above 450 dlrs.
      Gold was fixed this morning in London at 411.30 dlrs.
      Despite current strong interest in gold mine stocks, many
  investors still want to buy physical gold, Witte said.
      Interest in gold mine stocks may also wane if stock
  exchange rallies under way in many countries start to waver.
      Hermann Strohmeyer, vice president of Commerzbank AG's
  foreign exchange trading and treasury department, said gold is
  poised to rise to 460 to 470 dlrs an ounce in the second half
  of this year.
      The price is unlikely to fall much below 380 or 390 dlrs an
  ounce, and probably will continue in a range between 380 and
  430 dlrs in the first half of this year, he said.
