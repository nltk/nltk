GERMAN SUGAR OFFERS PUT AT ABOUT 100,000 TONNES
  The West German intervention board said
  about 100,000 tonnes of sugar have been offered into
  intervention so far.
      A spokesman, speaking from Frankfurt, told Reuters offers
  have increased recently but contracts have not yet been
  concluded. A European Commission spokesman in Brussels earlier
  confirmed that one mln tonnes of sugar had been offered to
  intervention boards in various member states. The intervention
  board spokesman in Frankfurt said, "One million tonnes is an
  awful lot and the Community's coffers are almost empty. This
  could turn into a serious political problem."
      West German trade sources said they believed the one mln
  tonne offer by the EC sugar industry into intervention would
  have a neutral market impact overall.
