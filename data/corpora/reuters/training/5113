MINN. BANK, OKLA. THRIFT ACTIONS TAKEN
  Beaver Creek State Bank in Beaver
  Creek, Minn., failed and the bank's insured assets were
  transferred to Citizens State Bank of Silver Lake, Minn., the
  Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said.
      Separately, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board said Victor
  Federal Savings and Loan Association of Muskogee, Okla., was
  placed into receivership.
      Beaver Creek's two offices will re-open as branches of
  Citizens on Monday.
      The transfer was arranged because there were no bids to buy
  Beaver Creek, the FDIC said.
      Citizens will pay a premium of 30,000 dlrs  to the FDIC and
  purchase Beaver Creek's assets for 5.3 mln dlrs.
      It was the 43rd bank failure in the nation this year.
      The FHLBB said Victor Federal Savings was insolvent and its
  assets were transferred to a newly chartered federal mutual
  association with directors named by the FHLBB.
      Victor was a stock association with 564 mln dlrs in assets.
      The new association is to be known as Victor Savings and
  Loan Association and its assets continue to be insured by the
  Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp, the FHLBB said.
