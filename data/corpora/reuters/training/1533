U.S. TREASURY AIDE WARNS ON INFLATION
  Thomas Berger, Deputy Assistant
  Secretary of the Treasury, said that a further drop in the
  exchange value of the dollar could cause prices to go up and
  trigger inflation.
      He told a meeting of the President's Export Council that
  the Japanese and the Germans have cut their profit margins to
  reflect recent drops in the dollar, so prices have remained
  much the same.
      But he added that if the dollar dropped further there could
  be inflation in the United States.
      Berger also said that a further devalued dollar may cause
  economic depressions in some U.S. trading partners, and that
  would not be in America's interest because it would close those
  markets to U.S. goods.
