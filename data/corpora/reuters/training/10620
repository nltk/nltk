TURKISH SHIP IN OIL ROW HEADS FOR AEGEAN
  A Turkish research ship, escorted by
  warships and air force planes, left for the Aegean to press
  Ankara's case in an escalating row with Greece over oil rights,
  the semi-official Anatolian News Agency said.
      The ship set off this morning from the Dardanelles port of
  Canakkale with flags flying and watched by sightseers, the
  agency said.
      Prime Minister Turgut Ozal said last night the ship would
  not go into international waters unless Greece did the same.
      "We are waiting for the first move from them," he told
  Turkish Radio in London.
