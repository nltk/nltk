  Zambian copper production rose 3.2 pct to
  113,275 tonnes in fourth quarter 1986 from 109,767 in the same

      A spokesman for the government-controlled mining company
  said the country's cobalt production fell 24 pct to 879 tonnes
  over the same period, while cobalt sales rose 92 pct to 1,734
