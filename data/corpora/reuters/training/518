ROTTERDAM PORT UNION AND EMPLOYERS TO MEET
  Dutch port and transport union, FNV,
  agreed to an employers' request to reconvene abandoned peace
  talks tonight to try to end strikes that have disrupted
  Rotterdam's general cargo sector for the past six weeks, a
  union spokesman said.
      Talks broke down Thursday when the union walked out after
  employers tabled their final offer to end the strikes which
  started January 19 in protest at planned redundancies of 800
  from the sector's 4,000 workforce, starting with 350 this year.
      The employers' invitation to restart the talks comes on the
  day a deadline set by Minister of Social Affairs Louw de Graaf
  for a resolution of the dispute expires.
      De Graaf said if the dispute had not ended by today he
  would withdraw the 10 mln guilder annual labour subsidy to the
  sector.
      No comment was immediately available from the employers'
  organization.
