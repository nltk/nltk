HARCOURT &lt;HBJ> DISAPPOINTED WITH HARPER &lt;HPR>
  Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc said it
  is disappointed that no negotiations with Harper and Row
  Publishers Inc are underway.
      Harcourt made a 50 dlrs a share unsolicited bid on March
  11.
      On March 17, Harcourt said three of its officers met with
  Harper's financial advisor but has had no discussions since
  then.
      Harcourt said it does not plan to increase its bid.
      Harcourt's bid was preceded by an earlier 34 dlrs a share
  bid by Theodore Cross.
      Harper had no response to Harcourt's announcement. Earlier
  today, Harper said a recently appointed special committee of
  independent directors had received expressions of interest from
  several domestic and foreign firms with respect to
  restructuring or acquisition transactions.
      Harper said no determination had been made as to any
  transaction and that its special committee is continuing in
  talks with interested parties in an effort to come to a
  conclusion in the near future.
