STRIKE TO CLOSE NEW ZEALAND PORTS ON MONDAY
  Harbour workers said they will
  strike for 24 hours on Monday, effectively closing all New
  Zealand's ports.
      The strike is over deadlocked wage negotiations.
      A Harbour Employees Workers' Union spokesman told reporters
  there will be no ship movements in and out of ports from
  midnight on Sunday (1200 hrs GMT March 15).
      There will be no loading or unloading involving harbour
  board workers and the Cook Strait ferries, which provide a
  vital link between New Zealand's North and South Islands, will
  not run, he added.
