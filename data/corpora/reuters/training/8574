U.S. TO ASK JAPAN TO DROP BEEF RESTRICTIONS
  U.S. Agriculture Secretary
  Richard Lyng will ask the Japanese Government to remove all
  beef import restrictions when he visits there next month.
      Lyng's remarks came in a speech at Oklahoma State
  University today.
      "We think Japanese consumers should have the same freedom
  of choice as our consumers. Look at all the Japanese cameras
  and tape recorders in this room. We know they'd buy more beef
  if they had the opportunity," Lyng said.
