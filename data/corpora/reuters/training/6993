  Three consecutive days of talks between
  management and unions aimed at ending the three month old
  strike at Cargill U.K. Ltd's oilseed processing plant at
  Seaforth, ended yesterday without resolving the situation,
  although some progress was made, a company spokesman said.
      Fresh talks have been scheduled for next Tuesday, he said.
