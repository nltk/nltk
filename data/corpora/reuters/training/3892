BRAZILIAN FCOJ OFFICIAL WELCOMES U.S. DUTY CUT
  Mario Branco Peres, president of
  the Brazilian Association of Citrus Juice Industries
  (Abrassuco), welcomed a decision by the U.S. Commerce
  Department sharply cutting its duties on imported frozen
  concentrated orange juice (FCOJ) from Brazil.
      Speaking by telephone from Sao Paulo, Peres said, "With its
  decision, the U.S. government recognised the honesty of
  Brazilian exporters, who never have the intention of practising
  dumping."
      In a final ruling yesterday, the U.S. government eliminated
  the duties shipped by Sucocitrico Cutrale and cut to 1.96 pct
  the duty on Citrosuco. Duties of 8.54 pct had been set last
  October.
      Peres said Brazil had enough orange juice to meet the needs
  of its major clients.
      "We do not have in stock what we would like to have, but we
  certainly have enough orange juice available to supply our
  buyers," Peres said, declining to estimate the amount of the
  current stock. "To keep it a secret is part of our strategy," he
  added.
      Peres said the price policy of the orange juice was based
  on market conditions.
      "There is nothing better than a free trade policy," he said.
      Cutrale and Citrosuco officials were not immediately
  available for comment.
