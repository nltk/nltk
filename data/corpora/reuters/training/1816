GENERAL HOST &lt;GH> SEES YEAR LOSS
  General Host Corp said it will
  report a loss from continuing operations and a sharp decline in
  net income for the year ended January 25, 1987, due to
  substantial operating losses in its Frank's Nursery and Crafts
  unit. For the year ended January 25, 1986, General reported net
  income of 29.7 mln dlrs.
      The company said it discovered problems in its unit's
  computerized accounts payable system. It said results of its
  other nursery and craft unit, Flower Time Inc, are not
  affected. It said its accountants are investigating the
  problem, which will delay release of its full-year results.
