MIYAZAWA SAYS PARIS ACCORD HELPING STABILISE RATES
  Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the
  Paris currency accord has contributed to the stability of
  exchange rates.
      Miyazawa told a press conference the agreement reached last
  month in Paris by six major industrial nations to cooperate in
  bringing about currency stability has prevented speculative
  concerns from being active in money centres.
      The decision in Paris is being understood by the market, he
  said. The yen-dollar exchange rate has been moving in a narrow
  range since finance ministers of Britain, Canada, France,
  Japan, the U.S. And West Germany reached the accord.
