HUNGARIAN 1987 SUGAR BEET AREA LITTLE CHANGED
  Hungary is to grow sugar beet on
  105,000 hectares of land this year compared with some 95,000 in
  1986, the official MTI news agency said.
      Diplomats said this reflected Hungary's policy of keeping
  the sugar beet area stable under the current five-year plan
  (1985-89) and producing enough to cover only domestic demand
  despite the recent rise of world prices to 10 month highs.
      Drought cut the 1986 harvest to 3.58 mln tonnes from 4.07
  mln in 1985. But a record yield of 130 kilos per tonne of beet
  kept production at 454,000 tonnes, with 30,000 extra refined in
  Yugoslavia from Hungarian beet. Output was 483,000 in 1985.
