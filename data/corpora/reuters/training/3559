ALGERIA REGULATES USE OF COFFEE ADDITIVES
  The Algerian authorities have regulated
  the addition of chickpeas and barley used to make imported
  coffee go further, the official APS news agency reported.
      Taking advantage of scarcity, private roasters were selling
  ground coffee mixtures which were 75 pct non-coffee, it said.
  Since the beginning of March, the coffee market has been
  strictly regulated by the state food marketing monopoly Enapal.
      Now a third of imported coffee will be sold as pure beans
  and two thirds as a ground mixture with a choice of 30 pct
  chickpeas or 30 pct barley. In March private dealers will
  handle 2,050 tonnes of pure coffee and Enapal 6,050 tonnes of
  mixtures.
