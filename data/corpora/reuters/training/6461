RHODES &lt;RHDS> SEES SHARPLY LOWER 4TH QTR NET
  Rhodes Inc said it now estimates fourth
  quarter, ended February 28, earnings were eight cts a share,
  down from the 25 cts earned in the final quarter of fiscal
  1986.
      The company said the major causes for the reduction were an
  unfavorable LIFO adjustment and softer than projected sales in
  the quarter, due primarily to unfavorable weather.
      Despite the 4th qtr results, Rhodes said, "net income for
  the year just ended should come close to the record level of
  the previous year" -- 1.61 dlrs dlrs a share.
