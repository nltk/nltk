NO ZIMBABWE DOLLAR DEVALUATION - CENTRAL BANK
  Zimbabwe's Reserve Bank, the nation's
  central bank, has denied the Zimbabwe dollar would be devalued.
      Bank Governor Kombo Moyana told The Herald daily newspaper
  "unfortunate and completely unfounded speculation that a
  depreciation of the Zimbabwe dollar was about to occur" had
  aggravated a serious foreign exchange shortage.
      "During February and the early part of March this
  (speculation) caused importers to bring forward their payments
  and exporters to delay as long as possible the inward
  remittance of export receipts, resulting in a significant
  slowdown in net foreign exchange inflows," he added.
