YUGOSLAVIA WHEAT FREE OF WINTERKILL - USDA
  There was no evidence of winterkill
  in Yugoslavian winter wheat during field travel along a line
  running northwest from Belgrade to near Maribor, the U.S.
  Agriculture Department's counselor in Belgrade said in a field
  report.
      The report, dated February 26, said there is evidence of
  delayed germination in most areas due to late seeding last fall
  because of dry conditions.
      However warm temperatures over the past three weeks have
  promoted some early growth and will help the crop catch up on
  last fall's late seeding, it said.
      Some Yugoslav agriculture officials are concerned about the
  situation because warm temperatures have brought the grain out
  of dormancy and taken away snow protection a little early, the
  report said.
      Cold temperatures over the next month could cause damage
  under these conditions, they said.
      The report said all wheat farmers contacted during the
  field trip were optimistic about the crop and the way it
  emerged from winter.
