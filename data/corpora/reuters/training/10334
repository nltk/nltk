BOTSWANA BANS ZIMBABWE MEAT PRODUCTS, AGENCY SAYS
  Botswana has stopped importing almost
  all meat products from Zimbabwe after reports of a suspected
  outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the neighbouring country.
      Botswana's official news agency, BOPA, announcing the ban
  last night, quoted Agriculture Minister Daniel Kwelagobe as
  saying only sterilised and canned animal products would be
  allowed into the country, with immediate effect.
      He said Zimbabwean veterinary officials had notified him
  that they suspected foot and mouth disease had broken out at
  Insiza, 100 km northeast of Bulawayo, capital of the mainly
  cattle-ranching southwestern province of Matabeleland.
      Zimbabwean officials were not immediately available for
  comment.
      The ban will affect products such as uncanned meat, milk,
  ham, butter and bacon, BOPA reported.
      Botswana exports much of its high-grade beef to the
  European Community and augments its local supplies with meat
  imports from Zimbabwe.
