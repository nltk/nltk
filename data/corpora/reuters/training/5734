N.Z. PORTS REOPEN, BUT FURTHER CLOSURES POSSIBLE
  Harbour workers returned to work
  this morning after a strike in support of pay claims closed New
  Zealand's 15 ports for 24 hours yesterday.
      But the Harbour Workers Union told reporters the pay
  dispute is not settled and the union's national executive will
  meet here tomorrow to decide its next moves.
      "Obviously we will be considering further industrial action,"
  Union secretary Ross Wilson said in a radio interview.
      The union rejects employers offers of a 7.5 pct pay rise
  over 15 months. It wants 7.0 pct over 12 months.
