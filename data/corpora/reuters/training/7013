U.K. UNEMPLOYMENT FALLS IN FEBRUARY
  Unemployment in the U.K. Fell a
  provisional seasonally-adjusted 44,100 in February, to total
  3.07 mln or 11.1 pct of the workforce, the Employment
  Department said.
      In January, seasonally adjusted unemployment fell by a
  revised 1,100 to 11.3 pct, it said. Initially the January
  position was reported as flat.
      The unadjusted jobless total, including school leavers,
  fell to 3.23 mln, or 11.7 pct, from 3.30 mln, 11.9 pct, in
  January.
      February was the seventh successive month that seasonally
  adjusted unemployment registered a fall.
      It was at a peak of 11.7 pct last summer.
      Lord Young, the Employment Minister, said there appeared
  little doubt the monthly fall, which has been running at about
  20,000, will continue.
      A Department spokesman said the sharp fall in February
  reflected some compensation for the flat figure in January and
  continued the downward trend seen in the past six months.
      He said the February fall was spread throughout the country
  and among men and women.
