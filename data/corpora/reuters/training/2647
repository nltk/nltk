SANTA FE SOUTHERN &lt;SFX> APPEALS MERGER RULING
  Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp said it
  filed a petition asking the U.S. Interstate Commerce Commission
  to reconsider its earlier rejection of the merger of the
  holding company's railroad assets.
      The ICC had rejected in July the merger of the Santa Fe and
  Southern Pacific Railroads on the grounds that it would reduce
  competition.
      Santa Fe in its petition outlines an array of
  pro-competitive agreements with other railroads which would
  preserve the economic benefits of the merger for the merged
  railroad and the public.
      If the commission agrees that public benefits and
  competitive enhancements will result, it can vote to reopen the
  merger case. Interested parties have until March 25 to file
  statements in response to the supplemental petition.
