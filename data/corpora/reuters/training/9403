NAVISTAR &lt;NAV> STILL EXPECTS HIGHER 1987 NET
  Navistar International Corp chairman
  Donald Lennox repeated that benefits from recapitalization are
  likely to boost future earnings for fiscal 1987.
      Lennox told the annual meeting that future quarterly and
  full year earnings from ongoing operations should be
  "significantly above 1986 results."
      In his remarks, Lennox said management has no plans to
  recommend reinstatement of the company's common stock dividend
  in the foreseeable future.
      He said the outlook for the medium duty truck market
  continues to point to little or no change. But recent order
  receipts indicate a "firmer tone in the heavy duty truck
  segment," which could result in a five to eight pct increase in
  industry shipments for the full year, he said.
      After restructuring under the holding company format, the
  company's present truck and engine subsidiary will be known as
  Navistar International Transportation Corp. Neil Springer
  currently president and chief operating officer of Navistar
  International was named chairman of the new subsidiary.
      James Cotting, now vice chairman and chief financial
  officer, was named to succeed Lennox as chairman and chief
  executive officer of Navistar International Corp. Lennox will
  retire March 31.
      Shareholders at the meeting approved a change in the
  company's structure to a holding company format, to be
  effective April 1.
