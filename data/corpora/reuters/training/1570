FROST NOT EXPECTED TO DAMAGE POLAND'S WHEAT
  Poland's winter wheat is likely to
  survive recent frosts but the impact of the cold will not be
  known until late April, the Polish meteorology institute said.
      Some varieties of winter wheat sown in Poland can survive
  ground temperatures as low as minus 20 degrees C, Spokesman
  Teresa Tomaszewska told Reuters.
      Even though an earlier thin protective layer of snow mainly
  melted in February, air temperatures down to minus 30 C should
  not be harmful, she said, but added that wheat can still be
  damaged by cold spells in March and April, when young shoots
  may be exposed to night frosts.
