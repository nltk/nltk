AIDE SAYS FRANCE SUPPORTS OIL AND FATS TAX
  France supports the European Commission's
  plans for a European Community (EC) fats and oils tax but
  objects to some of its oilseeds proposals, Yves Van Haecke, an
  aide to French agriculture minister Francois Guillaume said.
      He told a general assembly of France's Oilseeds Federation
  (FFCOP) that a suppression of monthly increases of oilseed
  support prices, for example, was unacceptable.
      French oilseeds experts added the principle of a single tax
  regardless of varying quality was clumsy and capable of
  unneccessarily alienating exporters such as the U.S.
