ACCORD SAID IN SIGHT IN BRAZIL SEAMEN'S STRIKE
  An accord is in sight in Brazil's
  20-day-old national seamen's strike, which has seriously
  delayed exports, a union official said.
      The official, speaking from strike headquarters in Rio de
  Janeiro, said up to 30,000 of Brazil's 40,000 seamen were still
  on strike.
      He said the others had returned to work over the last week,
  accepting pay offers of 120 pct from four private companies and
  from the Frota Nacional de Petroleiros (Fronape), part of the
  state-owned oil company Petrobras.
      The association grouping private shipowners, Syndarma, has
  also offered 120 pct but talks have so far been deadlocked over
  payment for overtime.
      The union official said he believed this issue would be
  resolved shortly.
