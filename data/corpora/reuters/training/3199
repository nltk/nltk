  South Korean Foreign Trade Minister
  Rah Woon Bae said his country's firms have agreed to buy 1.8
  billion dlrs worth of U.S. goods during his two-week buying
  trip to the United States.
      Rah said most of the purchases represented shifts from

  reduce its seven billion dlr trade surplus with the United
  States.
      South Korea has a five billion dlr trade deficit with
  Japan.
