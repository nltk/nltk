IROQUOIS BRANDS &lt;IBL> REBUFFS LYON FOODS CLAIMS
  Iroquois Brands Ltd said it has
  been sued by Lyon Food Cos Inc which is seeking 2.3 mln dlrs in
  damages in connection with the April 1986 nine mln dlrs
  purchase of Iroquois' former specialty food products segment.
      Iroquois said that based upon the defenses it will assert,
  it does not believe that any charge against income is required
  as a result of the claim.
