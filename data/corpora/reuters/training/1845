U.S. CABINET COUNCIL SET TO MULL FARM ISSUES
  The Reagan administration's
  cabinet-level Economic Policy Council is scheduled to meet
  Friday to discuss, among other issues, the status of
  agricultural legislation, administration officials said.
      The officials said discussion of a U.S. Agriculture
  Department wheat export subsidy to the Soviet Union was not on
  the agenda. Matters not on the agenda, however, can be brought
  before the council, the officials said.
      Grain trade officials have speculated that USDA would make
  a wheat export enhancement offer to Moscow, but USDA officials
  have said the matter is not under active consideration.
      USDA today transmitted to Congress a package of legislative
  proposals, including bills that would cut target prices and
  speed up loan rate reductions.
