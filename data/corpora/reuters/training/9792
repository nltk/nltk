CURRENCY EXCHANGE LOSS PUSHES MALAYSIA'S DEBT UP
  An exchange loss of 7.6 billion
  ringgit in 1986 pushed Malaysia's outstanding external debt up
  to 50.99 billion ringgit, from 1985's 42.3 billion, the Central
  Bank said in its annual report.
      Bank Negara said although Malaysia's net borrowing dropped
  in 1986, its external debt rose due to the 30 pct appreciation
  of the basket of currencies against which the ringgit is
  pegged.
      The basket comprises principally the U.S. Dollar, yen,
  mark, Swiss franc, French franc, sterling, guilder, Canadian
  and Singapore dollars, it added.
      Bank Negara said growth in external debt, which declined
  progressively from a peak of 58 pct in 1982 to 13.6 pct in
  1985, rose by 20.2 pct in 1986.
      Malaysia's debt serving ratio of 17.6 pct of its exports in
  1986 is within the prudency limit of 20 pct, Bank Negara
  Governor Jaafar Hussein told reporters.
