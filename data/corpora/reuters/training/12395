DEUTSCHE AGREES FULL TAKEOVER OF FORMER EURASBANK
  Deutsche Bank AG &lt;DBKG.F> has agreed
  to take over the outstanding 25 pct in &lt;Deutsche Bank (Asia)
  AG>, the former &lt;European Asian Bank AG>, from
  Creditanstalt-Bankverein &lt;CABV.VI>, Deutsche management board
  joint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen told a news conference.
      Euras broke even in 1986 and required no funding from
  Deutsche, he said. He gave no details of the deal with
  Creditanstalt.
      Press reports that Deutsche was planning a takeover of
  Lloyds Bank plc &lt;LLOY.L> were without foundation, he said.
      Herrhausen said Deutsche had taken part in the recent
  capital increase of &lt;Morgan Grenfell Group plc>, but had no
  plans to raise its 4.4 pct share in Morgan Grenfell.
      &lt;Banca d'America e d'Italia SpA>, in which 98.3 pct was
  acquired from Bankamerica Corp &lt;BAC.N> late last year, would be
  consolidated this year, and contribute to further expansion of
  Deutsche's business, management board joint spokesman F.
  Wilhelm Christians said.
      Following a ruling earlier this year from the Federal High
  Court, Deutsche had included its non-bank holdings in the
  balance sheet section "participations," Christians said.
      But Christians said the bank still regarded shares in these
  non-bank companies as an investment rather than an active
  participation.
      Parent bank total participations rose to 6.45 billion marks
  in 1986 from a comparable 4.57 billion in 1985 including a rise
  to 3.79 billion from 2.34 billion in bank participations.
      Herrhausen said the grouping of holdings in the balance
  sheet in this was was not a first step to floating them off in
  a separate holding company.
