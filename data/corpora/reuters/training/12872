SPAIN AGREES SALE OF CORN TO GREECE
  Greece has agreed to buy between 27,000
  and 33,000 tonnes of Spanish corn, a spokesman for Cargill's
  Spanish unit Compania Industrial y de Abastecimiento S.A.
  (CINDASA) said.
      He told Reuters the sale price was around 28.95 pesetas per
  kilo but that the final quantity and delivery date has not yet
  been set. The corn will be shipped in the coming days from
  Valencia.
      He said CINDASA will also ship 6,000 to 7,000 tonnes of
  Spanish corn to Italy in the second half of this month.
      The CINDASA spokesman said other corn shipments this month
  will include between 15,000 and 30,000 tonnes bound initially
  for Rotterdam and Ghent and destined for unspecified northern
  European countries. He said shipments of 35,000 to 50,000
  tonnes of low specific gravity barley were also expected this
  month and added that Greece, the Netherlands, Ireland and
  Belgium were considering imports of Spanish flour for milling.
      Market sources said the corn exports, the absence of
  imports from the rest of the EC and the delay in shipments of
  corn from the U.S. Had pushed domestic corn prices up by around
  0.25 pesetas a kilo today compared with yesterday.
