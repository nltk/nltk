U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN FURTHER 284 MLN STG HELP
  The Bank of England said it provided the
  money market with a further 284 mln stg assistance in the
  afternoon session.
      This takes the bank's total help so far today to 508 mln
  stg and compares with its revised estimate of a 900 mln stg
  shortage in the system which it earlier revised up from 850
  mln.
      The central bank made outright purchases of bank bills
  comprising 100 mln stg in band one at 9-7/8 pct, 56 mln stg in
  band two at 9-13/16 pct, 112 mln stg in band three at 9-3/4 pct
  and 16 mln stg in band four at 9-11/16 pct.
