BANGLADESH PORT WORKERS END STRIKE
  Cargo handling resumed at
  Bangladesh's Chittagong port today after 7,000 workers ended
  their three day walk-out triggered by a pay dispute, port
  officials said.
      Loading and unloading of 14 ships stranded by the strike
  started this morning and will be completed as quickly as
  possible, they said.
      The strikers returned to work after an agreement was
  reached last night between port authorities and the Port
  Workers Association, they said without giving details.
