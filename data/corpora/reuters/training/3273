DUTCH RETAILER AHOLD SEES UNCHANGED 1987 PROFIT
  Dutch food retailer Ahold
  NV &lt;AHLN.AS> expects unchanged profits in 1987 but said it will
  take advantage of the lower dollar to expand further in the
  U.S.
      Turnover will grow but net profits are expected to remain
  around the 1986 level of 132.4 mln guilders due to higher Dutch
  taxes and a three-year expansion plan, Ahold Chairman Albert
  Heijn told a news conference.
      The profit forecast allows for a dollar rate around current
  levels of just over three guilders.
      Turnover and net profit in 1986 were hit by the dollar,
  which fell to an average 2.46 guilders from 3.35 in 1985.
