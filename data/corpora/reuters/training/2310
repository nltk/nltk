ROTTERDAM PORT SUBSIDY TO END JULY 1 - MINISTER
  Dutch Social Affairs Minister Louw de
  Graaf announced he is withdrawing the annual 10 mln guilder
  labour subsidy for Rotterdam's strike-hit general cargo sector
  as from July 1.
      Late last month de Graaf said that if the dispute was not
  settled by Monday this week he would withdraw the subsidy.
      The chairman of the port employers' organization, SVZ,
  Jacques Schoufour, said he was unhappy with the decision and
  added there was now no alternative to proceeding with
  redundancy plans.
      The series of strikes in the sector started on January 19
  in protest at employers' plans to make 800 redundancies from
  the 4,000-strong workforce by 1990 starting with 350 this year.
      Meanwhile, the port and transport union, FNV, attacked loss
  figures given for the port for this year.
      The figures, issued by accountants on behalf of the SVZ,
  put total losses for last year at 34 mln guilders and in 1985
  at 37 mln. Earlier, the employers had put the figure at around
  30 mln.
      The FNV said the actual losses were nearer 17 to 20 mln and
  said the employers had inflated the figures as part of their
  plan to restructure completely the port's general cargo sector.
