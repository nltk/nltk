LONDON MEAT FUTURES NEED MARKETING - CHAIRMAN
  Pigmeat and beef futures, which have
  been thinly traded on the London Meat Futures Exchange, LMFE,
  despite lower physical prices and the introduction of new
  contracts, need more effective marketing, LMFE chairman Pat
  Elmer said in his annual report.
      In 1986 the Exchange introduced live cattle and pig cash
  settlement contracts, representing a move away from the
  problems of cash distortions and squeezes, which initial
  deliverable "buyers option" contracts created, he said.
      Although the physical industry is aware of the market and
  follows its prices keenly, this has not been reflected in
  market volume, Elmer said.
      "If we are to achieve our true potential the floor members
  must give the market much more time and attention," he added.
