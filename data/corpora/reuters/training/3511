TRADE SAYS EC SUGAR TENDER HARD TO FORECAST
  Traders here and in Paris said the
  results of today's EC white sugar tender are hard to forecast
  because of plans by a group of French, West German, Dutch and
  Belgian operators to sell one mln tonnes of sugar into
  intervention.
      London traders said bids for licences have been reported
  between 43.00 and 44.00 Ecus per 100 kilos and if any licences
  are granted they are likely to be towards the lower end of that
  range, possibly 43.30/43.50 Ecus.
      Traders in Paris said they expect maximum rebates of
  between 43 and 43.50 Ecus.
      Other than the Commission releasing no sugar for export,
  the likely tonnage is expected to be very small, the London
  traders said, while the French sources declined to estimate
  volume in view of the psychological impact of the planned sales
  into intervention in protest against EC export policies.
      Last week licences for 60,500 tonnes were awarded at a
  maximum rebate of 43.147 Ecus.
