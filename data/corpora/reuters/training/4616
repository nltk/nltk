MIYAZAWA SAYS EXCHANGE RATES WILL STAY STABLE
  Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a
  press conference he thinks exchange rates will remain stable
  due to the currency accord reached in Paris last month by six
  major industrialised nations but he did not say for how long.
      The dollar has hovered around 153 yen since the six agreed
  to cooperate to bring about currency stability.
      Asked to comment on remarks by some U.S. Officials calling
  for a further decline of the dollar, Miyazawa said only the
  U.S. President and the U.S. Treasury Secretary can make
  official statements about exchange rates.
