  said it is negotiating for a minority stake in a British and
  Commonwealth Shipping Plc &lt;BCOM.L> courier service in a
  transaction which might include a convertible loan issue.
      KLM, already active in the fast growing door-to-door
  delivery market through a 50-pct stake in a Dutch courier
  service, is seeking to buy one-third of &lt;IML Air Services Group
