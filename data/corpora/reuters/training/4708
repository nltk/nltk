JAPAN CABINET APPROVES BILL ON GOLD COIN ISSUES
  The cabinet has approved a bill making it
  easier for the government to issue commemorative coins, a
  Finance Ministry official said.
      The bill, which must still be approved by parliament, would
  take effect in April 1988. It would allow the government to
  issue 1,000, 5,000 and 10,000 yen coins without special
  legislation, although higher-valued coins would still need a
  special law, the official said. At present it can only issue
  coins of 500 yen or less.
