U.K. WHEAT MARKET EASES ON INTERVENTION RELEASE
  U.K. Domestic wheat markets dropped about
  one stg per tonne early this morning following overnight news
  that the EC is releasing a further 300,000 tonnes of wheat from
  British intervention stores for the home market over a three
  month period.
      April deliveries of denaturable wheat were offered in East
  Anglia at 124 stg and May at 125 stg per tonne, both one stg
  down on yesterday's traded rates.
      The market is expecting U.K. Wheat futures to show a
  similar loss at today's opening.
