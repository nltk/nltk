GERMAN MARCH UNADJUSTED JOBLESS FALLS
  West German unemployment, unadjusted
  for seasonal factors, fell to 2.41 mln in March from 2.49 mln
  in February, the Federal Labour Office said.
      The total represents 9.6 pct of the workforce compared with
  10.0 pct in February.
      The seasonally adjusted jobless total rose, however, in
  March to 2.23 mln from 2.18 mln in February, it added.
      In March last year the unadjusted unemployment total stood
  at 2.45 mln and represented 9.8 pct of the workforce.
  Seasonally adjusted unemployment was 2.29 mln.
      The Federal Labour Office said the number of workers on
  short time rose by 80,629 to 462,802 and the number of
  vacancies increased by 15,263 to 180,047.
      Labour Office President Heinrich Franke, announcing the
  figures, said the hesitant decline in the unadjusted jobless
  total reflected continuing bad weather, slack activity in the
  capital goods sector and structural changes in the coal and
  steel industry.
      In a separate statement, the Federal Statistics Office said
  the rise in the overall number of people in employment had
  slowed in February.
      The Office said that, according to estimates for February,
  25.7 mln people were in work, a rise of around 240,000 or 0.9
  pct compared with the same month in 1986.
      It noted that in January the year-on-year rise was 250,000
  or 1.0 pct and the number in work stood at 25.78 mln. The
  decline in February compared with January reflected seasonal
  factors, it added.
