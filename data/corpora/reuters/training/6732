MURRAY OHIO &lt;MUR> SEES HIGHER FIRST QUARTER NET
  Murray Ohio Manufacturing Co
  said it expects first quarter earnings to be higher than the
  year-ago 4,800,840 dlrs or 1.25 dlrs per share due to excellent
  lawn and garden shipments.
      The company said bicycle sales were soft early in the
  period, but recent orders and shipments have been running well
  ahead of last year.
      It said it expects to meet analysts' projections of
  earnings for the full year of 1.50 dlrs per share and it could
  possibly exceed the estimate if orders continue strong.
