CHRYSLER, LAMBORGHINI STILL IN JOINT VENTURE TALKS
  Joint venture talks that could
  lead to Chrysler Corp &lt;C> taking a stake in Italian car maker
  &lt;Automobili Lamborghini SpA> are continuing, a Lamborghini
  spokesman said.
      He told Reuters the two companies are discussing a number
  of topics ranging from "a joint venture in the production area
  to Chrysler becoming a shareholding partner" in the Italian
  firm.
      The spokesman declined to comment on whether Chrysler was
  interested in acquiring control of Lamborghini or if the two
  sides were close to an accord.
      He said the two companies are discussing the possibility of
  jointly developing a sports car aimed primarily at the U.S.
  Market.
      The spokesman said Chrysler officials in Detroit had
  already visited Lamborghini's production plant in Bologna and
  another visit may be scheduled.
      Lamborghini, which is controlled by the Mimran Group of
  Switzerland, broke even last year on sales of 29 billion lire,
  he said.
      Chrysler also holds a 15 pct interest in Italian sports car
  producer &lt;Alfieri Maserati Spa>.
