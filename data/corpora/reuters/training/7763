RECOMMENDATION REITERATED ON WANG LABS &lt;WANB>
  Analyst Thomas McCrann of Merrill
  Lynch said he reiterated a "buy" recommendation of Wang
  Laboratories Inc, noting that a successful cost cutting
  campaign could reduce the earnings loss expected for the third
  quarter ending in March.
      Wang was the most actively traded stock on the American
  Stock Exchange, rising 3/4 to 16-5/8.
      McCrann said that "Wang is a little bit ahead of where they
  were expected to be in their cost reductions, and as a result,
  the odds have increased that the loss for the quarter will be
  less than had been expected."
      McCrann said he expects Wang to report break even earnings
  per share or only a small loss per share for the third quarter.
      He said for the year, however, the company should report a
  loss of about 50 cts a share compared with earnings of about 35
  cts a share a year ago.
