WHITE HOUSE WELCOMES RISE IN INDICATORS
  The White House welcomed last
  month's 0.7 pct increase in the Index of Leading Economic
  Indicators, the government's key barometer of future economic
  growth.
      The increase reversed a decline in January of 0.5 pct.
      Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the new
  figures signalling more economic growth in coming months showed
  that the index was "back on track" after its downturn at the
  first of the year.
