U.S. RETAIL SALES RISE 4.1 PCT IN FEBRUARY
  U.S. retail sales rose 4.77 billion
  dlrs, or 4.1 pct, in February to a seasonally adjusted 122.29
  billion dlrs, the Commerce Department said.
      The increase came after a revised 7.4 pct drop in January
  sales to a level of 117.52 billion dlrs. The department
  previously reported January retail sales fell 5.8 pct.
      Excluding autos, retail sales in February were up 1.5 pct
  after falling by a revised 0.4 pct in January.
      Department spokesmen said the major cause for the revision
  downward in January sales was a weaker January auto dealer
  sales figure than originally estimated.
      Auto dealer sales were 26.91 billion dlrs in February, a
  14.4 pct rise from January levels. But January sales dropped by
  27.7 pct from December levels to 23.52 billion dlrs, more than
  the 22.4 pct fall originally reported.
      The expiration of the sales tax deduction under new tax
  laws on January 1 was the main reason for the drop in January
  sales, department spokesmen said.
      Sales of durable goods rose in February by 8.8 pct to 46.72
  billion dlrs after dropping by 17.7 pct in January.
      Building materials rose 1.8 pct in February after falling
  by 1.7 pct in January.
      Non-durable goods sales rose by 1.3 pct to 75.58 billion
  dlrs in February after falling by 0.2 pct in January, the
  department said.
      General merchandise stores rose 1.4 pct after increasing
  sales by 1.6 pct in January, and department stores were up two
  pct in February after rising 1.5 pct in January.
      Food store sales increased 0.4 pct after declining by 1.0
  pct in January, while grocery store sales increased 0.3 pct in
  February after falling 0.6 pct in January.
      Gasoline service station sales rose 2.0 pct in February
  after a 1.9 pct January increase.
      Apparel store sales were up 0.8 pct last month after
  falling 3.0 pct in January, while sales at eating and drinking
  places increased 1.5 pct after rising 0.5 pct in January.
      February's retail sales were 4.4 pct above the year-ago
  level of 117.09 billion dlrs, the department said.
