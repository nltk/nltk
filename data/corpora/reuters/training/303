INDONESIAN SOYBEAN IMPORTS FORECAST TO RISE
  Soybean imports are forecast to rise to
  425,000 tonnes in 1987/88 (October/September) from an estimated
  300,000 in 1986/87 and 375,000 in 1985/86, the U.S. Embassy
  said in its annual report on Indonesia's agriculture.
      It said Indonesia did not achieve its goal of
  self-sufficiency in soybean output in calendar 1986 because it
  did not meet a planned increase in area planted and because
  yields have remained below target.
      Soybean meal imports are forecast to fall to around 190,000
  tonnes in 1987/88 from 270,000 tonnes in 1986/87 and 295,000
  tonnes in 1985/86.
      Domestic soybean production is forecast to rise steadily to
  1.08 mln tonnes in 1987/88 from 980,000 in the current year and
  890,000 in 1985/86, the report said.
      Imports are forecast to fall in the current year but to
  rise in 1987/88 because of a new soybean crushing plant due to
  come on stream in early 1988.
      China is the main supplier with a 79 pct share, while the
  U.S. Provides the rest, it said.
      "This pattern will likely continue during 1986/87 since
  domestic soyfood processors prefer Chinese beans and are
  willing to pay a premium for them," it said.
      Area planted is expected to increase by 10 pct in both
  1986/87 and 1987/88.
      "Yield increases continue to be hampered by an insufficient
  supply of quality seeds, along with pest and disease problems,"
  the report said.
