MARCOR &lt;MAAR> EXPECTS FISCAL YEAR PROFIT
  MarCor Development Co Inc said
  it expects to post a profit for its fiscal year ended February
  28 of about two mln dlrs, compared to a year earlier loss of
  3.2 mln dlrs.
      During the prior year the company operated as F and M
  Importing, a publicly-held wholesale food distributor.
      During March last year privately-held Marcor acquired a
  controlling interest in F and M Importing, divested the food
  business, renamed the company and began operating as a real
  estate investment and service company.
