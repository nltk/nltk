  &lt;Berliner Bank AG> has suffered
  losses of between 10 and 100 mln marks through credits granted
  by its Stuttgart branch by officials there exceeding their
  powers, a bank spokesman said in answer to queries.
      The spokesman declined to say exactly how large the losses
  were. Berliner Bank has suspended the three managers of its
  Stuttgart branch and is continuing an investigation into the
  case, in which state prosecutors are also participating.
      The fact that powers had been exceeded emerged in a routine
  check at the branch. The City of West Berlin owns 74 pct of
  Berliner Bank and the rest is held by small shareholders.
