JAPAN UNEMPLOYMNENT RISES TO RECORD IN JANUARY
  Japan's seasonally adjusted unemployment
  rate rose to a record 3.0 pct in January, the worst since the
  Government started compiling unemployment statistics under its
  current system in 1953, up from the previous record 2.9 pct in
  December, the government's Management and Coordination Agency
  said.
      Unemployment was up from 2.8 pct a year earlier.
      Unadjusted January unemployment totalled 1.82 mln people,
  up from 1.61 mln in December and 1.65 mln a year earlier.
      Male unemployment in January remained at 2.9 pct, equal to
  the second-worst level set last December. Record male
  unemployement of 3.1 pct was set in July 1986.
      Female unemployment in January remained at 3.0 pct, equal
  to the record level marked in April, August, September and
  December last year.
      January's record 3.0 pct unemployment rate mainly stemmed
  from loss of jobs in manufacturing industries, particularly in
  export-related firms, due to the yen's continuing appreciation
  against the dollar, officials said.
      Employment in manufacturing industries fell 380,000 from a
  year earlier to 14.30 mln including 1.83 mln employed in the
  textile industry, down 190,000 from a year earlier, and 1.06
  mln in transport industries such as carmakers and shipbuilders,
  down 170,000.
