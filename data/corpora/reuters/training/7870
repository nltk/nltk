PAN AM'S &lt;PN> MAIN UNIT TO REPORT SMALLER LOSS
  Pan Am Corp said its largest division,
  the Atlantic, will report a first quarter loss that will be
  substantially lower than that reported a year ago.
      In the 1986 1st qtr, Pan Am reported a net loss of 118.4
  mln dlrs, which included foreign exchange losses of 19.3 mln.
  The company did not say how much the Atlantic division lost.
      Pan Am also said it is encouraged by passenger traffic
  results so far this year as well as booking trends.
      In January and February, the airline said total systemwide
  revenue passenger miles were up five pct and 11 pct,
  respectively, over the same months last year.
      It also said that based on current trends, its largest
  division should report vastly improved second-quarter traffic
  compared to last year, which resulted in a load factor of 45.7
  pct for the second quarter of 1986.
      Pan Am also said its principal subsidiary, Pan American
  World Airways, had a 1986 net loss of 469.3 mln dlrs, compared
  with a profit of 38.7 mln dlrs in 1985, which included a gain
  of 341 mln dlrs for the sale of its Pacific Division. It said
  the airline's operating loss for the year was 325.5 mln dlrs
  compared with a operating profit of 196.5 mln dlrs in 1985.
