LONDON SUGAR OPENS STEADY BUT QUIET
  Raw sugar futures had a quiet opening
  call of 38 lots with prices holding steady from last night with
  gains of 20 to 80 cents a tonne, dealers said.
      Aug was trading at 157.60 dlrs from 157.40 asked yesterday.
      The modest rise continued the recent rally from an oversold
  situation but, dealers noted, there was little fresh physicals
  news to stimulate activity.
      Whites tenders are scheduled for next Wednesday by Syria
  for 36,000 tonnes and Greece for 40,000 tonnes while Pakistan
  is due to tender on April 11 for 100,000 tonnes whites, they
  said.
      This week has seen whites buying by India and Egypt.
