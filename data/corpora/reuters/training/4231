IGENE BIOTECHNOLOGY &lt;IGNE> FINDS CROP LOSS AID
  IGENE Biotechnology Inc said its
  research teams at Auburn and Hebrew universities have found its
  patented pesticide is highly effective in combating a disease
  reponsible for approximately three billion dlrs in annual crop
  losses.
      The company said it learned ClandoSan controls nematodes,
  deadly plant pathogens formerly controlled by now-banned
  synthetic chemicals.
      Varieties of the deadly disease attack major cash crops
  such as cotton, vegetables, orchard trees, citrus fruits, and
  garden plants, the company said.
