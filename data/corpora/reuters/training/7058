TRANSAMERICA &lt;TA> TO HAVE GAIN ON UNIT SALE
  Transamerica Corp said it expects
  to realize a gain of about 75 mln dlrs on the
  previously-announced sale of the group life and health
  operations of its Transamerican Occidental Life Insurance Co
  subsidiary to Provident Life and Accident Co &lt;PACC>.
      But it said its Transamerica Life Cos unit plans to change
  to a more conservative method of amortizing deferred policy
  acquisition costs, resulting in a one-time charge that will
  offset most of the gain from the sale.
      Transamerica said it has now signed a definitive agreement
  for the sale, which will be structured as a reinsurance
  transaction involving about 400 mln dlrs of reserve
  liabilities.
      It said the 75 mln dlr gain from the sale and about 125 mln
  dlrs of statutory surplus that previously supported operations
  of the group being sold will be used to support Transamerica
  Life Cos' efforts to accelerate the growth of its remaining
  businesses.  It said closing is expected by May One, subject to
  regulatory approvals.
