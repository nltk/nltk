DATA CARD &lt;DATC> SEES LOWER YEAREND RESULTS
  Data Card Corp said it does not
  expect to meet its earnings and revenue targets for the fiscal
  year ending March 28.
      Earlier, the company said it expected earnings per share
  from continuing operations to be 35 to 45 cts a share. Now it
  sees that figure at 15 cts a share, or about 1.5 mln dlrs.
      Data Card said it expects revenues for the year in the
  range of 170 mln to 175 mln dlrs, down from a previous estimate
  of 180 mln to 185 mln dlrs.
      It said integration of Addressograph Farrington Inc, a
  private company acquired on Aug 25, 1986, is proving more
  difficult than expected. The company reported revenues of 154
  mln dlrs and net income of 10.6 mln dlrs in fiscal 1986 ended
  March 26, 1986.
