  Strong winds and high seas
  today closed Alexandria, Egypt's biggest port, and an oil
  pipeline terminal nearby, officials said.

  were closed this morning after one tanker loaded and sailed.
      Officials said that five other tankers were waiting outside
  the terminal for conditions to improve.
