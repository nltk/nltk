WEST GERMAN 1986 SUGAR OUTPUT RISES
  West German sugar production last year
  rose 38,000 tonnes to an estimated 3.17 mln tonnes, the
  Agricultural Ministry said.
      It said the increase was exclusively due to higher beet
  sugar content, which went up to 17.93 pct from 17.3 pct in
  1985.
      Last year's beet deliveries totalled 20.22 mln tonnes, down
  554,000 tonnes from the previous year.
      The ministry estimates West Germany's sugar
  self-sufficiency during the current agricultural year
  (July/June) unchanged at 137 pct.
