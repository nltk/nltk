GERMAN BANK SEES GOOD SOVIET TRADE PROSPECTS
  Soviet-West German trade is expected
  to develop favourably due to Moscow's increasing openness to
  East-West economic relations, Dresdner Bank AG's Moscow
  representative Michael Stein said.
      He told a bank presentation the Soviet Union was last year
  hit by the fall in world oil prices, which cut export revenue
  from oil-related products and natural gas, and its overseas
  buying power was also adversely affected by the lower dollar.
     Dresdner Bank economist Alfred Apholte said the Soviet
  Union's large currency and gold reserves had softened the
  impact of the dollar weakening and oil price drop.
