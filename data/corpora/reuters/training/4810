GENERAL MILLS&lt;GIS> SEES STRONG 4TH QTR RESULTS
  General Mills Inc, reporting
  stronger results for the third quarter ended February 22, said
  it expects the momentum to continue in the fourth quarter.
      The company said it expects to report "strong earnings per
  share growth and a record return on equity in fiscal 1987." It
  said this should be achieved despite expected non-operating
  charges in the final quarter.
      General Mills said these charges will likely offset
  non-operating gains, which included six cts a share in the
  first half.
      General Mills said at the end of the third quarter, its
  return on average equity was 31.6 pct.
      It said major factors contributing to the third quarter
  improvement were an 11 pct gain in unit volume by Consumer
  Foods, continuing good profit growth at Red Lobster USA and
  strong performance in Specialty Retailing.
      The company reported quarterly earnings of 56.9 mln dlrs,
  or 64 cts a share, up from 46.4 mln dlrs, or 52 cts a share a
  year ago. Sales rose to 1.31 billion dlrs from 1.13 billion
  dlrs. Year-ago data reflect a two-for-one common stock split.
