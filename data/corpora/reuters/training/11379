CANADA INDUSTRY PRICES FALL 0.2 PCT IN MONTH
  The Canadian industrial product price
  index, base 1981, fell 0.2 pct in February after rising 0.2 pct
  in January, Statistics Canada said.
      "A significant part of this monthly decrease was
  attributable to the impact of the increase of the Canadian
  dollar on prices for wood pulps, newspaper, aluminum, nickel
  and motor vehicles," the federal agency said.
      On a year-over-year basis, the index was down 0.8 pct,
  little change from the 0.9 pct decline posted in January.
