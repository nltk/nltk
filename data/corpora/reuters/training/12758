SOUTH KOREAN MONEY SUPPLY FALLS IN MARCH
  South Korea's M-2 money supply fell two
  pct to 33,463.4 billion won in March from 34,030.3 billion in
  February, provisional Bank of Korea figures show.
      It rose a revised 0.5 pct in February and was up 14.7 pct
  from a year earlier.
      M-1 money supply fell 8.7 pct to 7,767.8 billion won in
  March against a revised rise of 4.3 pct in February. It has
  increased 8.3 pct since March last year.
      Bank officials said the March falls were due mainly to
  various measures by the bank to absorb excess money.
