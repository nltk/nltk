MIDDLE SOUTH &lt;MSU> TO CONSIDER DIVIDEND
  Middle South Utilities Inc will not
  consider payment of a common stock dividend until there is
  another ruling on a Mississippi Supreme Court order rolling
  back rates at the company's Mississippi Power and Light Co
  subsidiary, chairman Edwin Lupberger said.
      He told security analysts Middle South was close to
  recommending resumption of the common stock dividend when the
  Mississippi court ordered the rate rollback. Following the
  order, he noted, the unit cancelled a planned sale of preferred
  stock. Middle South has petitioned the court for a rehearing or
  a stay of the order while it is being appealed.
