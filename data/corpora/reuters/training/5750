TWA &lt;TWA> SEES BENEFITS IN USAIR &lt;U> MERGER
  Trans World Airlines Inc, which
  disclosed that it does not intend to seek control of USAir
  Group at this time, said it still believes a combination of the
  two airlines would have benefits to both.
      In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
  TWA, which is controlled by Carl Icahn, said it continues to
  closely watch the developments of USAir, which has an agreement
  to acquire Piedmont Aviation Inc &lt;PIE>.
      TWA said it spent 178.2 mln dlrs to acquire its 4,043,200
  USAir shares, which amount to 14.8 pct of its total outstanding
  common stock.
      TWA said it would not buy more USAir Group stock, at least
  for the moment.
      But it said it still believes a TWA-USAir combination would
  "create certain synergies that would be mutually beneficial to
  both carriers."
      TWA stressed that it reserved the right to revive its
  takeover attempt and said it may continue to explore the
  feasibility and strategies of gaining control of USAir.
      Further purchases of USAir stock would require the approval
  of the Department of Transportation, TWA said.
      Because of Department of Transportation rules, TWA also
  said it put its USAir stock into a voting trust with Fleet
  National Bank as the voting trustee.
      The voting trust agreement requires the bank to vote in
  favor of any acquisition agreement between TWA and USAir and to
  opposed any other merger of USAir.
