JAPAN FEBRUARY RESERVES RECORD 51.73 BILLION DLRS
  Japan's external reserves rose to a record
  51.73 billion dlrs at the end of February from the previous
  record of 51.46 billion at end-January, the Finance Ministry
  said.
      End-February reserves last year were 27.58 billion dlrs.
      In January, the nation's foreign reserves showed the
  largest-ever monthly increase at 9.22 billion dlrs due to
  massive Bank of Japan dollar buying intervention during the
  month as the dollar fell briefly to an all-time low of 149.98
  yen on January 19, foreign exchange dealers said.
