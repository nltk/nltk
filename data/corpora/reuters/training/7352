VULCAN &lt;VUL> WITHDRAWS JONES/VINING &lt;JNSV> BID
  Vulcan Corp said it was
  discontinuing its efforts to negotiate a purchase of the common
  stock of Jones and Vining Inc.
      On February 6, Vulcan, a Cincinnati maker of shoe lasts and
  other products, offered five dlrs a share for all of Jones and
  Vining common, subject to certain conditions.
      Vulcan said it is dropping the proposal because it believes
  subsequent actions by Jones and Vining are hostile and Vulcan
  is only interested in a friendly transaction.
      Jones and Vining makes shoe lasts and shoe components. It
  has about 3.7 mln shares outstanding.
