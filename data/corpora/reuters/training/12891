SPAIN RAISES CALL MONEY RATE TO 14.5 PCT
  The Bank of Spain said it raised its rate
  for overnight call money to 14.5 pct from 14 pct with immediate
  effect at today's daily auction for assistance funds.
      The move followed comments yesterday by central bank
  governor Mariano Rubio, who said money supply growth was too
  fast.
      The bank said later that it was leaving its rate for
  special assistance funds from its second window unchanged at 16
  pct, surprising operators who had expected an increase there
  too.
