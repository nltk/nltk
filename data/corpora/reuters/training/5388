CANADA MANUFACTURING UTILIZATION RATE RISES
  Utilization of Canadian manufacturing
  capacity rose to 77.2 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 from 77
  pct in the third quarter, Statistics Canada said.
      "Although the change was small, this marked the first
  quarter since the third quarter of 1985 in which the
  utilization rates for manufacturing as a whole rose," the
  federal agency said.
      Increased residential construction led to strong increases
  in the building materials sector, led by a 3.3 pct increase in
  non-metallic mineral industries.
