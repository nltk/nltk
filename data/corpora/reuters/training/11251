HAPAG ORDERS NEW CONTAINER SHIP FROM CHINA
  &lt;Hapag Lloyd AG> said it ordered a new
  container vessel from China for its Australia service.
      The order was given to the &lt;Hudong shipyards> in Shanghai
  after lengthy negotiations with West German shipbuilders, the
  company said in a statement.
      The Chinese firm offered to build the vessel at over 30 mln
  marks less than West German yards, despite government subsidies
  which Bonn pays its ailing shipbuilding industry, Hapag said. A
  company spokesman would not comment on the total order value
  but said the new vessel would replace the 33,333 dwt Sydney
  Express in 1989 and would carry 2,700 container units.
