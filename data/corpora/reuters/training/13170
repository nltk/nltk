IBC COULD CLOSE MAY EXPORT REGISTRATIONS TONIGHT
  The Brazilian Coffee Institute
  (IBC) could close May export registrations tonight following
  extremely heavy sales today, exporters said.
      They estimated registrations today at between 1.0 mln and
  1.2 mln 60 kilo bags. Yesterday 645,000 bags were registered.
      The exporters said over 1.0 mln bags of total registrations
  could have been the declaration of sales made in the six weeks
  during which books were closed. The rest would be new sales.
      When the IBC opened May registrations from yesterday it did
  not set any volume limit. April registrations opened and closed
  on February 16 when a daily record 1.68 mln bags were declared.
