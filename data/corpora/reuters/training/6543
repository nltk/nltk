FED EXPECTED TO ADD RESERVES IN MONEY MARKET
  The Federal Reserve is expected to
  enter the U.S. Government securities market to add temporary
  reserves indirectly via 1.5 billion dlrs or more of customer
  repurchase agreements, economists said.
      They said the below-six pct Federal funds rate suggests the
  Fed does not have a large reserve adding need. However, some
  dealers reportedly backed out of the three-day System
  repurchase agreements set on Monday, leaving the Fed with a
  somewhat increased need to supply reserves.
      Federal funds, which averaged 6.05 pct yesterday, opened at
  5-15/16 pct and remained there in early trading.
