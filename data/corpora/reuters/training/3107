DIXIE YARNS &lt;DXYN> TO ACQUIRE TI-CARO INC
  Dixie Yarns Inc and &lt;TI-CARO
  Inc> jointly said they signed a merger agreement calling for
  Dixie to acquire all TI-CARO's stock in exchange for three mln
  of Dixie's common.
      The companies said the previously announced merger has been
  approved by TI-CARO's board and is expected to close by early
  April.
      They said the revenues of the combined companies will be
  over 600 mln dlrs, and Dixie said the merger will not dilute

  management led leveraged buy-out.
