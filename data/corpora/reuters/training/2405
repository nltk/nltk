COMBINED INTERNMATIONAL &lt;PMA> SEES STRONG 1987
  Combined International Corp should have
  another strong year, President Patrick G. Ryan told analysts,
  although he declined to forecast earnings specifically.
      In 1986, the company reported operating income of 5.51 dlrs
  a share, up from 4.84 dlrs a share a year earlier. Revenues
  increased to 1.81 billion dlrs from 1.36 billion dlrs.
      Ryan said Combined is testing a direct response long-term
  care product through its Union Fidelity Life Insurance Co and
  has plans to offer it through Ryan Insurance Group.
      In answer to a question on Combined's possible exposure to
  AIDS-related health claims, Ryan said it was "minimal" although
  he conceded that every carrier who provides coverage is
  vulnerable.
