MURRAY OHIO &lt;MYO> SEES HIGHER 1ST QTR EARNINGS
  The Murray Ohio Manufacturing
  Co said it expects first quarter earnings to be higher than the
  4,800,840 dlrs, or 1.25 dlrs per share, it recorded for the
  first quarter of last year.
      The company, which produces lawn mowers and bicycles, said
  earnings are ahead of last year due to increased lawn and
  garden shipments in January and February and a record-setting
  pace in March.
