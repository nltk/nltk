TRANSNATIONAL INDUSTRIES &lt;TRSL> SEES LOSS
  Transnational Industries Inc said due
  to continuing manufacturing difficulties at its AlloyTek Inc
  jet engine component subsidiary, it expects to report a net
  loss of about 300,000 dlrs or 12 cts per share for the fourth
  quarter ended January 31.
      It said revenues for the period were about 11.9 mln dlrs,
  about even with those of a year earlier.
      For the full fiscal year, the company said it earned about
  775,000 dlrs or 34 cts per share, down from 1,402,000 dlrs or
  76 cts per share a year before.
      The company said an unexpectedly large volume of customer
  inquiries at its Spitz Inc simulation products subsidiary has
  caused higher than expected business development outlays.
      The company said it expects significant contract awards to
  Spitz later this year.
      It said it has started implementing a plan to progressively
  reduce manufacturing costs at AlloyTek over the next several
  quarters.  The company said it may move AlloyTek's plant from
  Grandville, Mich., to a lower labor cost area.
      The company said it discovered the extent of the AlloyTek
  problems during a year-end review of subcontracts and related
  work in progress for production of jet engine components for
  General Electric Co &lt;GE>.
      It said it will release annual results around April 15.
