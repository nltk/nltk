AUDIO/VIDEO &lt;AVA> SUES OVER CYCLOPS &lt;CYL> BID
  Audio/Video Affiliates Inc said it
  has filed suit against &lt;Dixons Group PLC>, Cyclops Corp,
  Alleghany Corp &lt;Y> and others in connection with Dixons'
  recently completed tender offer in which it raised its
  ownership of Cyclops to 56 pct.
      The company said the suit, filed in U.S. District Court for
  the Southern District of Ohio, seeks a temporary restraining
  order and preliminary injunction requiring Dixons, for 10
  business days, to permit any Cyclops shareholder who previously
  tendered and now wishes to withdraw to do so.
      The company said the order and injunction would also
  prohibit Dixons from exercising a "lockup" option granted it by
  Cyclops and prohibit Dixons for 10 business days from
  attempting to exercise any control over Cyclops.
      Audio/Video said the suit also requests the court to order
  Cyclops to immediately provide to all potential bidders for
  Cyclops all information given to Dixons.
      Audio/Video and Citicorp &lt;CCI> have been tendering for all
  Cyclops shares in a competing offer at 80.00 dlrs per share but
  said it could raise its bid to 92.50 dlrs under certain
  circumstances.  Dixons offered 90.25 dlrs in its tender.
      In February Alleghany agreed to buy Cyclops' steel and
  nonresidential construction business for 111.6 mln dlrs in cash
  and the assumption of liabilities.
