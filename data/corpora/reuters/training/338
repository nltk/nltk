SWEDEN TO GO AHEAD WITH S. AFRICAN TRADE SANCTIONS
  Sweden's ruling Social Democratic
  Party gave full power to the government to decree unilateral
  trade sanctions against South Africa, Prime Minister Ingvar
  Calrsson said.
      Carlsson told a news conference the party decided the fight
  against apartheid took priority over Sweden's traditional
  policy of only adopting sanctions with the backing of the U.N.
  Security Council.
      The government will decide later what form the trade
  boycott will take and when it will come into force.
