EC MEMBER STATES COOL ON CEREAL PLANS
  European Community (EC) member states
  have generally given a cool initial reaction to proposals by
  the European Commission for cereal price changes and related
  measures in the coming season, EC diplomats said.
      They said that in meetings of the EC Special Committee on
  Agriculture representatives of most member states had said the
  changes, taken together, would have too harsh an impact on
  farmers' incomes.
      Only Britain and the Netherlands had shown willingness to
  accept the commission's overall package, they said.
      As well as cuts of over two pct in common prices for most
  cereals, the commission proposes a limitation of intervention
  to the February to March period and reduced monthly increments
  in intervention prices.
      EC Farm Ministers will have a first discussion of the
  proposals at a meeting beginning next Monday.
