KLM TO TAKE 15 PCT STAKE IN AIR UK
  KLM Royal Dutch Airlines &lt;KLM.A> said
  it agreed to take a 15 pct stake in Air U.K. Ltd, a subsidiary
  of British and Commonwealth Shipping Plc &lt;BCOM.L>, in a
  transaction worth around two mln stg.
     A KLM spokesman said KLM already cooperated closely with Air
  UK, which runs 111 flights a week to Amsterdam's Schipol
  airport from nine UK cities.
     British and Commonwealth Shipping said last week it held
  preliminary talks about a KLM minority stake in Air U.K. But
  gave no further details. KLM said it hoped the move would
  attract more British feeder traffic to Amsterdam Airport.
