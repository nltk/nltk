SAN DIEGO GAS &lt;SDO> SEES DECISION HURTING NET
  San Diego Gas and Electric Co said a
  California Public Utilities Commission decision to reconsider
  allowing only 20 mln dlrs of the 69 mln dlrs in San Onofre
  nuclear station costs it disallowed makes it likely that
  earnings in 1987 will be reduced at least 36 cts per share.
      The company said if the decision to disallow the other 20
  mln dlrs is not changed, earnings would be penalized by another
  19 cts.
