USDA ORANGE JUICE YIELD ESTIMATE
  The U.S. Agriculture Department
  projected an average yield of 1.47 gallons of frozen
  concentrated orange juice per box (42.0 degree brix equivalent)
  from Florida's 1986/87 crop.
      That compares with 1.46 gallons per box previously and 1.38
  gallons per box from the 1985/86 crop.
      The crop reporting board said the estimates for the 1986/87
  season are based on maturity and yields tests as of March 1.
