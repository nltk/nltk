ROTTERDAM SIGNS COOPERATION AGREEMENT WITH TOKYO
  The city of Rotterdam today signed an
  agreement in principle to cooperate with the AOMI Cargo
  Distribution Centre in Tokyo.
      Acting Mayor Roel den Dunnen said that cooperation between
  private and public entities in the Tokyo and Rotterdam area,
  and a fruitful exchange of information have a favourable
  influence on the flow of goods and services between the two
  countries.
      The AOMI Cargo Distribution Center, which will start
  operating in October this year, signed a similar agreement with
  Rotterdam's twinned-port of Seattle last September.
