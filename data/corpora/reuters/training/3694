FED EXPECTED TO ADD RESERVES
  The Federal Reserve is expected to
  intervene in the government securities market to add temporary
  reserves via customer or system repurchase agreements,
  economists said.
      Most economists said the Fed will inject reserves
  indirectly via customer repurchases, but they added that the
  Fed might opt for a direct injection of reserves via overnight
  system repurchases.
      Federal funds opened at 6-3/8 pct and eased to 6-5/16 pct
  in early trading. Funds averaged 6.29 pct yesterday.
