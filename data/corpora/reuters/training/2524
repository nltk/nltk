U.S. SENATE GROUP URGES SUBSIDIES FOR USSR
  A majority of the Senate Agriculture
  Committee urged President Reagan to reverse his opposition to
  export subsidies to the Soviet Union as a way to get its
  negotiators to purchase some 500 mln dlrs in American wheat.
      The group, led by committee chairman Patrick Leahy, a
  Vermont Democrat, urged Reagan to step up negotiations with the
  Soviet Union by providing export subsidies to help U.S.
  farmers.
