EC TO BOOST SPENDING ON JOB CREATION THIS YEAR
  The European Community (EC) is to boost
  spending to help the jobless this year.
      The EC's executive commission said in a statement spending
  on its so-called social fund would rise to 3.1 billion European
  Currency Units from 2.5 billion ECUs in 1986. The fund is
  designed to help boost job creation and improve worker
  mobility, and supplement national schemes in the EC's 12 member
  states.
      Another 60 mln ECUs could be added if EC ministers switch
  unused project credits to other programs, the Commission said.
      Italy is the largest net beneficiary in 1987, getting 635
  mln ECUs, with Britain in second place with 580 mln.
