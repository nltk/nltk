  Protection Group Inc> has agreed to issue it with 6.15 mln
  common shares of one U.S. Cent par-value at 1.72 stg each.
      The two groups have also begun exploratory talks on a
  possible merger of the Holmes business with the compatible
  businesses of Wormald, comprising some or all of its fire
  protection and security businesses in the Americas and Europe,
  Wormald said in a statement.
      The issue of shares in the New York-based Holmes is
  conditional upon shareholder approval at a general meeting.
      Wormald said its stake will represent 9.99 pct of Holmes'
  existing issued shares and 9.09 pct of the enlarged capital.

  further development of the Holmes business.

  complementary in terms of both geographical spread and the
  nature of their activities, with Holmes concentrating on
  burglar alarms and Wormald on fire systems.
      Holmes's operations are concentrated in and around New York
  amd Miami. It earned 11 mln U.S. Dlrs pre-tax in its last
  reported full year, 1985, and 6.0 mln in first half 1986.
