SWEDEN REVISES DOWN JANUARY'S INFLATION FIGURE
  Sweden's rate of inflation during
  January has been revised downwards after a fault was made in
  calculating the figures, the Central Bureau of Statistics said.
      The January rise in consumer prices was 1.0 pct instead of
  the previously announced 1.3 pct, the bureau said, without
  explaining how the error arose.
      Consumer prices in February rose 0.3 pct compared with 0.1
  pct in February last year, the bureau said. The total inflation
  rate so far this year is therefore 1.3 pct, allowing for
  January's revised figures, it added.
      Year-on-year inflation rose to 3.4 pct in February, against
  a revised 3.2 pct in January and a year-on-year rate of 5.3 pct
  in February 1986, the bureau said.
      The slowdown in price rises was mainly due to a government
  imposed price freeze which came into force on February 4, the
  bureau added.
