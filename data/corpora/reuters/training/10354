BANK OF SPAIN SUSPENDS ASSISTANCE
  The Bank of Spain suspended its daily
  money market assistance obliging borrowers to take funds from
  the second window, where on Wednesday rates were raised to 16
  pct compared with 14 pct for normal overnight funds.
      Money market sources said in view of high borrower demand
  the suspension was likely to remain in effect until April 3,
  the start of the next 10-day accounting period for reserve
  requirements. The suspension comes after the Bank yesterday
  gave 1,145 billion pesetas assistance, a record high for this
  year.
      It said 90 billion pesetas was provided at the second
  window.
