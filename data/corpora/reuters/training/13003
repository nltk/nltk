NORANDA SETS TEMPORARY MINE SHUTDOWN
  &lt;Noranda Inc> said
  production will remain shut down at its fire-damaged copper
  mine here until it can completely examine the mine.
      The fire, which started Wednesday and burned itself out
  late yesterday, killed one miner and trapped 56 others
  underground for about 24 hours. The 56 were eventually brought
  safely out of the mine.
      Company spokesman Dale Coffin said the investigation could
  take from a few days to several weeks, but would not be more
  specific.
      Noranda said that, when it resumes production, it plans to
  operate the mine at about one-third of the normal 72,000 metric
  tons annual finished capacity.
      The fire weakened part of the mine's support structure,
  Coffin said.
      Noranda said if it decides to keep the mine open, it would
  take four or five months before it could resume full
  production.
