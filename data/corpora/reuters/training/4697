ALUSUISSE PLANS FURTHER ALUMINIUM CAPACITY CUTS
  Schweizerische Aluminium AG &lt;ALUZ.Z>
  (Alusuisse) plans further drastic cuts in its aluminium
  smelting capacity and more concentration of higher value-added
  products, chief executive Hans Jucker said.
      Elaborating on plans disclosed in outline last September,
  company officials said current smelting capacity of 390,000
  tonnes a year would be cut to between 250,000 and 260,000
  tonnes by 1989 or 1990. They did not say where cuts might be
  made.
      Two years ago, before selling its Ormet Corp subsidiary in
  the United States to local management and staff, Alusuisse had
  an annual capacity of 800,000 tonnes.
