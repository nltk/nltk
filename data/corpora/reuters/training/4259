SWEDEN SETS OCTOBER DEADLINE FOR S.AFRICA BOYCOTT
  Sweden announced its promised program
  of unilateral economic sanctions against South Africa and gave
  firms an October deadline to cut trading links.
      Foreign Trade Minister Anita Gradin said a trade boycott of
  South Africa and neighbouring Namibia would take effect from
  July 1, followed by a three-month period of grace to give
  companies time to wind down their operations.
      From October 1, no direct trade would be allowed in either
  direction, with certain exceptions covering medical supplies
  and printed matter, Gradin told a news conference.
      She said exceptions would also be granted in cases where a
  Swedish trade boycott would benefit South African firms and
  disadvantage South Africa's black-ruled neighbours, the
  front-line states.
      Gradin cautioned that legislation upon which the boycott
  would be based was not impossible to get round. She said a
  parliamentary committee would investigate ways of closing some
  of the bigger loopholes, including indirect trade with South
  Africa via Swedish subsidiaries in third countries.
