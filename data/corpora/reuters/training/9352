TRICENTROL TO CONCENTRATE ON PROVEN RESERVES
  Tricentrol Plc &lt;TCT.L> said it will
  concentrate most of its efforts this year on its proven oil and
  gas reserves in order to maximise benefits to shareholders in
  the mid to long-term.
      It said in a statement "We are confident that substantial
  development funds will be available to Tricentrol and that we
  will be able to minimise further disposal of our interests."
      Tricentrol wrote off 57.5 mln stg on the reorganisation of
  its North American operations last year, when oil prices
  plunged. The group incurred a 1986 net loss of 3.7 mln stg
  against a 25.4 mln profit the previous year.
