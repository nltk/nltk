OREGON ALUMINUM SMELTER INCREASING OUTPUT
  Northwest Aluminum Co said it
  will open a second pot line in mid-May, bringing the smelter
  here to 80 pct of its production capacity.
      Northwest Aluminum President Brett Wilcox, who leased the
  30-year-old smelter from Martin Marietta Corp., said production
  would increase from around 45 tons a year at present to just
  over 70 tons.
      Martin Marietta closed and mothballed the smelter in 1984.
  Northwest Aluminum reopened it last December.
      Wilcox said a good aluminum market and several months of
  successful operation led to the decision to expand production.
