WHITE HOUSE WELCOMES RETAIL SALES FIGURES
  The White House welcomed the
  February retail sales figures showing a 4.1 pct rise, following
  a slow performance in January.
      Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters: "The February
  sales growth was broad-based and good news for the economy."
      Commerce Department figures showed a larger than expected
  rise following depressed levels of sales and factory orders in
  January.
