INDIAN PLANT SIGNS FIRST ALUMINA EXPORT CONTRACT
  An unnamed Norwegian firm agreed to
  buy 100,000 tonnes of alumina a year from a refinery in eastern
  Orissa state due to start operations in the next 12 months, a
  Commerce Ministry official told Reuters.
      He said the state-owned National Aluminium Co, which owns
  the plant, and the state-owned Mineral and Metals Trading Corp
  signed its first long-term export agreement with the company,
  but gave no further details.
      Of the plant's 800,000 tonnes annual capacity, 425,000 will
  be smelted into 218,000 tonnes of aluminium and the remaining
  375,000 will be exported, the official said.
