ZAMBIA EXPECTS SHARPLY REDUCED MAIZE CROP
  Zambia's marketed maize production will
  probably fall to less than 630,000 tonnes in 1986/87 (May-Apr),
  from 918,000 last year, because of poor rainfall in major
  producing areas, Agriculture Minister Kingsley Chinkuli said.
      He told Parliament that in the southern provinces the
  harvest would be over 50 pct down on the level in the previous
  marketing year.
      "The nation would be lucky to produce over seven mln bags
  (630,000 tonnes) of maize this year," he stated.
      Chinkuli added that Zambia was setting up an irrigation
  fund with Canadian aid to lessen the effects of poor rainfall.
