IVORY COAST BOOSTS MAIZE OUTPUT
  Ivory Coast maize output has risen
  steadily during the last two decades and the country aims to
  produce two mln tonnes annually "very rapidly," the official
  daily Fraternite Matin reported.
      It said the country reached self-sufficiency in maize three
  years ago and harvested a record 530,000 tonnes in 1985
  compared with only 200,000 tonnes 20 years earlier.
      The daily did not detail 1986 output but said further
  production increases are anticipated in the years ahead as part
  of a policy of boosting domestic output to cut grain imports.
