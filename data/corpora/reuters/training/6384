BELGIAN BANK SAID TO SEE SLOWER GROWTH
  An internal report produced by the
  Belgian National Bank foresees the country's gross national
  product growth falling in 1987 to 1.0 pct from 2.3 pct in 1986,
  the independent newspaper Le Soir said.
      A National Bank spokesman said the newspaper article was
  basically correct, but that the report was produced six weeks
  ago and figures were therefore to some extent out of date.
      The government's planning bureau predicted growth of 0.9
  pct this year in a study published last month.
