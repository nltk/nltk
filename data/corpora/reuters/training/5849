ZIMBABWE GDP RISES 0.2 PCT IN 1986
  Zimbabwe's real gross domestic product
  increased 0.2 pct in 1986, according to preliminary figures
  published by the Central Statistical Office (CSO). This
  contrasts with a rise of more than nine pct in 1985.
      The main reason for the slower rate of economic growth was
  a drop in the real value of agricultural output. This declined
  12 pct in 1986 following a 24 pct improvement the previous
  year. Mining output fell one pct in 1986 but manufacturing
  production increased 1.4 pct.
      The CSO said that at current prices GDP rose 12.7 pct to
  8.2 billion Zimbabwe dlrs, but inflation, measured by the GDP
  deflator, was estimated at 12.2 pct, so there was virtually no
  growth in real output during 1986.
