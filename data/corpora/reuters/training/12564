EC MUST EXPLAIN FARM POLICY TO U.S., FRANCE SAYS
  The U.S. and the European Community could
  enter into a new trade dispute unless urgent action is taken to
  explain EC farm policy to the U.S. Congress, French official
  sources said.
      They said Prime Minister Jacques Chirac planned to urge EC
  Commission president Jacques Delors to send a team of experts
  to Washington as soon as possible.
      Chirac returned to Paris this morning after three days of
  talks in New York and Washington in which trade and
  protectionism featured prominently.
      At the centre of the new trade tension is an EC Commission
  proposal to tax vegetable oils, the sources said.
