FARMERS CONCERNED ABOUT BRITISH SUGAR OWNERSHIP
  The National Farmers Union, NFU, remains
  concerned about the future ownership of British Sugar despite
  last week's decision by the government to block bids from
  Italy's Gruppo Ferruzzi and Britain's Tate &amp; Lyle Plc.
      The union's sugar beet committee met yesterday to consider
  the implications of a government Monopolies and Merger
  Commission, MMC, report issued last week. "We are still
  concerned about S and W Berisford being long-term owners of
  British Sugar," a spokesman said. "We do not view Berisford as
  providing the long-term stability we want."
      The Trade and Industry Secretary accepted a recommendation
  last week by the MMC that it block a bid by Tate and Lyle for S
  and W Berisford Plc and stop Gruppo Ferruzzi buying a majority
  of British Sugar, owned by Berisford.
      Union officials believe a new bid for the monopoly beet
  processor is now likely. "We are looking again at the
  undertakings that we have demanded of existing bidders and
  which we would seek of any future bidders," the spokesman said.
  The NFU, which represents Britain's 11,500 sugar beet growers,
  is also taking legal advice on particular paragraphs in the MMC
  report which it says need further explanation.
