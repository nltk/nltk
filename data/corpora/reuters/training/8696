IRAN SAID TO TEST FIRE SILKWORM MISSILE IN HORMUZ
  Iran has test-fired its newly acquired
  Silkworm anti-shipping missile in the Strait of Hormuz and has
  set up at least two land-based launching sites in the area, a
  British naval source in the Gulf said.
      The source, who declined to be identified, said Iran had
  fired the Chinese-made missile at a hulk off its southern Gulf
  naval port of Bandar Abbas and scored a hit.
      "These missiles pack a fairly big punch," he told Reuters.
  "There is no doubt they could be used to target (shipping)
  across the Strait of Hormuz."
