SENIOR DELEGATES PESSIMISTIC ON ICO TALKS
  Efforts to break an impasse between
  coffee exporting and importing countries over regulating the
  world coffee market in the face of falling prices appear to
  have failed, senior delegates said after a contact group
  meeting. The full ICO council is due to meet this evening.
      President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) Jorio
  Dauster told Reuters after the contact group meeting there had
  been no agreement on quotas as consumers had tried to dictate
  market shares rather than negotiate them.
      Dauster said there are no plans yet to renew negotiations
  at a later date.
