FARM PROGRAM CHANGES OUTLINED BY USDA OFFICIAL
  Upcoming changes being considered in
  the U.S. Agriculture Department's transportation and loan
  programs were outlined by a USDA official today.
      Addressing the annual meeting of the National Grain and
  Feed Association, Tom VonGarlem, assistant deputy administrator
  for USDA's state and county operations, said the following
  changes are under consideration by USDA.
      Termination of USDA's Transportation Assistance Program for
  wheat, barley and sorghum would be proposed this week.
      Changes in USDA's reserve rotation program are also under
  consideration, VonGarlem said. While the department has not
  made any final decision, banning the use of pik and roll grain
  in reserve rotation is under heavy consideration, he said.
      Changes in loan rates will definitely be looked at for next
  year's crop, he said, with the option of making soybean loans
  partially in cash and in certificates under consideration.
      VanGarlem said he will definitely not extend the 1987 crop
  program signup, saying he sees no reason to do so at this time.
      He also said wheat will not be considered for a cash bonus
  under the Conservation Reserve Program.
