U.S. WEATHER/COTTON SUMMARY -- USDA/NOAA
  Cotton planting began in California
  and was expected to proceed rapidly in the week ended March 28,
  the Joint Agriculture Weather Facility of the U.S. Agriculture
  and Commerce Departments said.
      In a summary of its Weather and Crops Bulletin, the agency
  said winds and low soil temperature retarded growth and
  hampered seeding in Arizona.
      Planting moved into Mohave and Pinal Counties.
      Cotton planting progressed well in the Lower Valley,
  Coastal Bend and along the Upper Coast of Texas.
      However, bad weather continued hampering cotton seedbed
  preparations in Oklahoma.
