CARLING O'KEEFE&lt;CKB> SELLS OIL UNIT, TAKES GAIN
  Carling O'Keefe Ltd said it sold its
  Star Oil and Gas Ltd unit to United Coal (Canada) Ltd for about
  57 mln dlrs cash.
      Carling said it will record an extraordinary gain of about
  two mln dlrs after tax, or nine cts a common share resulting
  from the sale.
      The company did not elaborate further on financial terms.
      A Carling official later said in reply to an inquiry that
  Carling would record the extraordinary gain in its fourth
  quarter ending March 31.
      The move came after Carling's 50 pct-owner &lt;Rothmans Inc>
  agreed last week to sell its Carling stake to &lt;Elders IXL Ltd>,
  of Australia, for 196.2 mln Canadian dlrs.
