U.S. WHEAT CREDITS FOR JORDAN SWITCHED
  The Commodity Credit Corporation
  (CCC) has switched 25.0 mln dlrs in wheat credit guarantees to
  Jordan under the Export Credit Guarantee Program to the
  Intermediate Export Credit Guarantee Program, the U.S.
  Agriculture Department said.
      The switch reduces the total value of GSM-102 guarantees
  for the current fiscal year to 30.0 mln dlrs.
      The credit terms extended for export sales under the
  Intermediate Export Credit Guarantee Program (GSM-103) must be
  in excess of three years but not more than seven years.
      All sales must be registered and exports completed by
  September 30, 1987, the department said.
