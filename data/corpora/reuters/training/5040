U.S. COTTON CERTIFICATE EXPIRATION DATE EXTENDED
  Expiration dates on upland cotton
  certificates issued under the 1986 upland cotton program are
  being extended, the Agriculture Department announced.
      The certificates are being extended because of a shortage
  of Commodity Credit Corporation inventory available for
  exchange with certificates, USDA undersecretary Danial Amstutz
  said.
      Presently, upland cotton commodity certificates expire nine
  months from the last day of the month of issuance.
      Under the new procedure, all current outstanding and all
  new upland cotton certificates issued under the 1986 upland
  cotton program will have an expiration date of either February
  29, 1988, or nine months from the last day of the month in
  which the certificate is issued, whichever is later.
