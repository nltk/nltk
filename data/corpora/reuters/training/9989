SENATE SEEKS U.S. PROBE OF CANADIAN CORN LEVY
  The Senate voted unanimously to seek
  an expedited U.S. probe of Canadian tariffs on corn imports to
  determine if the United States should retaliate.
      By 99 to 0, the Senate went on record against the 84.9
  cents per bushel tariff approved by the Canadian Import
  Tribunal.
      The non binding measure asked for a probe by the U.S. Trade
  Representative to determine within 30 days whether the tariff
  violates the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and if so
  recommend within 60 days to President Reagan retaliatory action
  against Canada.
