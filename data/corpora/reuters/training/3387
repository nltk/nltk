WARRINGTON SELLS SHOE DIVISIONS
  (Warrington Inc) said it sold its shoe
  divisions to Montreal-based (Taurus Footwear Inc) for
  undisclosed terms.
      The divisions manufacture and distribute Greb, Hush
  Puppies, Kodiak, and Santana brand shoes and had revenues of
  about 69 mln dlrs last year, Warrington said. It said the sale
  of the shoe divisions and the previous sale of its ski boot
  businesses will result in an unspecified net gain.
      Warrington said it plans to concentrate on its Canstar
  Sports Group Inc skate and athletic footwear division, the
  largest ice skate manufacturer and distributor in the Western
  world.
      Warrington said it decided to rationalize the balance of
  its ski businesses, which is expected to result in a divestment
  loss which could outweigh the net gains on the sales of its
  shoe and ski boot divisions.
      Taurus said the acquisition is expected to increase its
  annual sales to about 100 mln dlrs and make it Canada's largest
  footwear manufacturer.
