ARGENTINE PORT WORKERS TAKE INDUSTRIAL ACTION
  Argentine port workers began an
  indefinite protest against safety conditions at the port of
  Buenos Aires, stopping work for one hour per shift, a press
  spokesman said.
      He said three port workers had died over the last month in
  accidents. He said the decision to take action was made after a
  port worker died yesterday after being electrocuted.
