U.S. TO ALLOW TEMPORARY IMPORTS OF S.A. URANIUM
  The Treasury Department said it would
  temporarily permit imports of South African uranium ore and
  oxide pending clarification of anti-apartheid sanctions laws
  passed by Congress last fall.
      The decision was announced late Friday. It applies, until
  July 1, to uranium ore and oxide imported into the U.S. for
  processing and re-export to third countries.
      The Treasury said it took the action because it felt that
  when Congress passed the comprehensive South African sanctions
  bill last fall over President Reagan's veto it had not intended
  to hurt U.S. industry.
      In addition, the Treasury said it would permit U.S.-made
  goods to be imported temporarily from South African
  state-controlled organizations for repair or servicing.
