TWO HUNDRED FEARED DEAD IN FERRY DISASTER
  About 200 people are feared
  dead after a British cross-channel ferry rolled on its side off
  the Belgian coast last night -- but almost 350 passengers were
  plucked to safety from the ice-cold sea.
      Belgian Transport Minister Herman de Croo told reporters: "I
  fear the dead could be in hundreds, perhaps 200. Given the
  state of the water, I fear there is no hope."
      Townsend Thorensen, owners of the 7,951 tonne Herald of
  Free Enterprise, said the ferry was carrying 543 people and
  that 345 had been rescued. All but one were British.
