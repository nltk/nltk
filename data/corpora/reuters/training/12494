U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN FURTHER 152 MLN STG HELP
  The Bank of England said it had given the
  money market a further 152 mln stg assistance in the afternoon
  session.
      This takes the Bank's total help so far today to 497 mln
  stg and compares with its forecast of a shortage in the system
  of around 700 mln stg which it earlier revised down from 800
  mln.
      The central bank made outright purchases of bank bills
  comprising 34 mln stg in band one at 9-7/8 pct, 39 mln stg in
  band two at 9-13/16 pct, 51 mln stg in band three at 9-3/4 pct
  and 28 mln stg in band four at 9-11/16 pct.
