U.S. SOYBEAN MARKETING LOAN NOT NEEDED - LYNG
  U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
  Lyng said a marketing loan for soybeans would serve no present
  purpose because the U.S. price is not above the world price.
      Asked in an interview if it was time to consider a
  marketing loan for soybeans, Lyng said, "I don't think so. I
  don't think the world price is lower than our price anyway."
      However, the USDA secretary said that if current conditions
  of surplus production persisted, it might be appropriate to
  consider a marketing loan.
      "I suppose that under that condition there is a danger our
  exports will continue to drop and that the government will
  continue to accumulate large stocks of soybeans," he said. "It
  might be (worth contemplating a marketing loan), if there were
  a world market that was lower than our market."
