RUDING AGAINST FURTHER DOLLAR FALL, TRADE CURBS
  Shifts in domestic economic policy,
  not a further fall in the dollar or trade restrictions, are the
  key to reducing imbalances in trade and payments, Dutch Finance
  Miniister H. Onno Ruding said.
      Ruding told a meeting of the World Trade Forum here that
  protectionism would naturally lead to retaliation and aggravate
  the problems of heavily indebted developing countries.
      "The main contribution towards resolving the still enourmous
  U.S. trade deficit is not repeat not a further fall in the
  dollar, is not still more protectionism in your country."
      "No, it is - like in other countries - changes in domestic
  economic and financial policies," Ruding said.
      Ruding said he was less worried about a crisis of the
  weakening dollar than he was in January before the Paris accord
  to stabilize foreign exchange rates.
      He said the highest priority should be given to policy
  changes in the United States, especially reducing the budget
  deficit and encouraging domestic savings.
      But he said other countries, such as Japan and West
  Germany, also needed to take greater steps toward reducing
  their trade surpluses.
