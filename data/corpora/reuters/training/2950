TWA &lt;TWA> TO REFILE WITH U.S. AGENCY
  Transworld Airlines Inc plans to refile
  an application Monday with the Department of Transportation for
  approval to acquire USAir Group &lt;U>.
      The DOT late today dismissed TWA's application to acquire
  USAir.
      "When the DOT opens for business on Monday morning, we will
  be refiling a perfected and completed section 408 application,"
  said TWA general counsel Mark Buckstein.
      Buckstein said the DOT ruled the application, which was
  filed Wednesday, was incomplete. He said he did not yet know
  why the agency objected.
