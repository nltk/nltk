YUGOSLAV 1990 STEEL OUTPUT TO HIT 6.3 MLN TONNES
  Yugoslavian steel output will rise by
  one mln tonnes to 6.3 mln tonnes a year between 1986 and 1990
  under a development program adopted by the Yugoslav Iron and
  Steel Metallurgy Association, the official Tanjug news agency
  said.
      The association groups together the main Yugoslav iron and
  steel enterprises.
      Extraction of iron ore should show an annual growth rate of
  nine pct and reach seven mln tonnes by 1990 under the program.
  Iron output is planned to grow at eight pct a year, reaching
  4.5 mln tonnes at the end of the decade.
      Tanjug said the programme would create conditions for
  raising exports of finished steel products.
      The main Yugoslav steel producers plan to market 5.35 mln
  tonnes of steel goods this year, or 150,000 tonnes more than
  last year, with 1.5 mln tonnes going to export.
