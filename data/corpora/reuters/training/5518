U.S. COULD COMPLAIN TO GATT ON CANADA CORN DUTY
  U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
  Yeutter suggested the U.S. could file a formal complaint with
  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) challenging
  Canada's decision to impose duties on U.S. corn imports.
      Asked about the Canadian government decision to apply a
  duty of 84.9 cents per bushel on U.S. corn shipments, Yeutter
  said the U.S. could file a formal complaint with GATT under the
  dispute settlement procedures of the subsidies code.
      Other U.S. options would be to appeal the decision in
  Canadian courts, or to retaliate against Canadian goods, a
  lower-level U.S. trade official said. However, retaliation is
  an unlikely step, at least initially, that official said. No
  decision on U.S. action is expected at least until after
  documents on the ruling are received here later this week.
