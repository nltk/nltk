  plan with the Supermarkets General board under which
  Supermarkets General shareholders would have a common stock
  interest in the combined company.  It said it remains willing
  to negotiate all terms of the proposed acquisition.
      The original bid was worth about 1.62 billion dlrs.

  exchangeable for a new class of Supermarkets General debt
  securities that would be developed by Dart and Supermarkets.
      The new proposal would be subject to approval by the
  Supermarkets General board, it said.  The new bid was contained
  in a letter to the Supermarkets General board.
      In Woodbridge, N.J., Supermarkets General -- responding to
  a previous letter to its board by Dart -- said "Your conduct
  indicates to us that no transaction involving trust and
  confidence can be entered into with you.  Your propaganda and
  missstatements will not panic our board."
      Dart, in its previous letter, had alleged that Supermarkets
  General executives were seeking millions of dollar in severance
  and tax payments from Dart.
