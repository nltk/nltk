GOODRICH &lt;GR> TO PHASE OUT SOME BUSINESSES
  B.F. Goodrich Co said it will phase
  out the production of aircraft tires, missile and marine
  products and molded rubber products in Akron, Ohio, by the end
  of 1987, laying off about 790 salaried, production, maintenance
  and support services employees.
      The company said layoffs will start within the next few
  weeks.
      Goodrich said it will continue to make chemicals and
  adhesives in Akron, employing about 356.  Another 5000 salaried
  employees in Akron work for Goodrich.
      The company said it has not been able to operate the
  businesses being discontinued in Akron profitably enough to
  justify the large investment that it has in them.
      Goodrich said it will continue to make aircraft tires at
  Norwood, N.C., and sonar domes at Jacksonville, Fla., and will
  relocate its molded rubber products business to a site not yet
  chosen.  It said it will stop making insulators for missiles.
      Goodrich said it is prepared to discuss with officials of
  the United Rubber Workers Union severance benefits for affected
  employees and issues related to the continued operation in
  Akron of the chemical and adhesives businesses and to the
  phaseout of the Akron aircraft tire, missile and marine and
  molded rubber products manufacturing.
      A company spokesman said it does not expect any adverse
  impact on earnings from the move.
