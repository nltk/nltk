BSI RAISING 50 MLN SWISS FRANCS VIA RIGHTS ISSUE
  Banca della Svizzera Italiana &lt;BISZ.Z>
  said it planned a one-for-12 rights issue at 300 pct of nominal
  value to raise about 50 mln francs new capital.
      The rights issue would have a theoretical value to
  shareholders of 140 Swiss francs per bearer share and 45 per
  registered share.
      BSI was also seeking shareholder authorization for 200,000
  new participation certificates of a nominal value of 100 francs
  without rights for shareholders, to back future convertible or
  warrant bonds or for other purposes. Existing 500-franc "B"
  tranche certificates would be split five-for-one.
      The split would improve the marketability of the existing
  certificates, chief executive Giorgio Ghiringhelli told a news
  conference.
      The new bearer shares would be priced at 1,500 francs,
  compared with a closing price last Friday of 3,325 on the
  Zurich Stock Exchange, while the registered shares would be
  issued at 300 francs against a market price of 900.
