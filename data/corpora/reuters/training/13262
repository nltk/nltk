NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LOWERS BENCHMARK PRIME
  National Australia Bank Ltd &lt;NABA.S>
  said it lowered its benchmark prime lending rate to 18.25 pct
  from 18.5, effective today, but left its base rate at 18.5.
      The benchmark reduction brings the rate into line with the
  prime rates of most of Australia's trading banks, including
  those of two of the other three major trading banks.
      However, the rate is above the 18 pct - the lowest ruling
  rate - set by the other major, the Australia and New Zealand
  Banking Group Ltd &lt;ANZA.S>, on Friday and effective today.
      The benchmark is based on short-term interest rate
  movements while the base rate is tied to longer-term trends.
