  A shareholder group led by New York
  investor Robert Toussie told the Securities and Exchange
  Commission it sold off most of its holdings in Heck's Inc
  common stock but reserved the right to again seek control of
  the company in the future.
      The group, which includes the Edward A. Viner and Co
  brokerage, said it sold 579,600 shares since March 5, leaving
  it with 157,000 shares or 1.8 pct of the total outstanding.
      The group had proposed a takeover of Heck's in September
  but later withdrew the offer, and Heck's on March 5 filed for
  protection from its creditors under federal bankruptcy law.
