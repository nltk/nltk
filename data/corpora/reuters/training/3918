KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN &lt;KSU> MERGER RESPONSE
  Kansas City Southern
  Industries Inc said an attempt by Santa Fe Southern Pacific Co
  &lt;SFX> to reopen the proposed merger of the Atchison, Topeka and
  Santa Fe Railway Co and the Southern Pacific Transportation Co
  offers "nothing truly new."
      In a letter to shippers, Kansas City Chairman Landon
  Rowland stated "This proposed merger is plainly
  anti-competitive, as found by the ICC and urged by the
  Department of Justice. Nothing has changed."
      Landon said Kansas City Southern is continuing its efforts
  to acquire the transportation operation of Santa Fe Railway.
