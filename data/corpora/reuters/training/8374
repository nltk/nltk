TRADE PROPOSES NEW EC GRAIN INTERVENTION RULES
  The European Community (EC) cereals
  trade lobby organisation Coceral said it has written to EC Farm
  Commissioner Frans Andriessen to propose a new system for sales
  into intervention, which it claims could save the EC budget
  money.
      It proposes that applications for intervention be made
  through a certificate valid for execution three months later.
  If during the three months the trader found a market elsewhere,
  he could buy back the certificate on payment of a one pct
  premium.
      Coceral argues that this would restore the original
  function of intervention as a safety net and would end the
  present situation in which produce is often sold into
  intervention as a precaution.
