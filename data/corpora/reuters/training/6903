AMSTUTZ SEES MORE BULLISH WHEAT OUTLOOK IN 1987
  U.S. Agriculture Undersecretary
  Daniel Amstutz indicated the world wheat supply/demand
  situation has become more bullish recently because of
  developments in the world market and increased consumption.
      Speaking to a House Agriculture Appropriations
  subcommittee, Amstutz cited three factors which have improved
  the wheat outlook.
      He said world consumption of wheat is increasing by about
  20 mln tonnes this year, primarily for feed use. There are also
  reports from Australia, Canada and Argentina that plantings
  have been reduced, he said. Furthermore, he cited reports of
  greater than normal winterkill in the Soviet Union.
      "It seems reasonable to expect production and consumption
  to be in far better balance than a year ago," Amstutz said.
