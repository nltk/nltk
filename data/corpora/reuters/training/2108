POLAROID &lt;PRD> UP ON REAFFIRMED OPINION
  Shares of Polaroid Corp rose following
  a reiterated recommendation by Merrill Lynch and Co that
  focused on strong earnings momentum for the company, traders
  said.
      "We have been recommending the stock since it was in the
  50s, but we reiterated today because of expectations of strong
  earnings momentum, its benefits from the lower dollar and
  anticipation of nice gains in margins," Merrill Lynch
  analyst Charles Ryan said. He said a negative opinion by
  another brokerage house hurt the stock Wednesday, and it can be
  bought at a relatively bargain price today.
      Ryan said "you always have to look at Polaroid at its
  weakness. Its a volatile stock that has to be caught on
  weakness." Polaroid's stock, which gained more than a point
  early this morning, was trading at 76-1/8, up 5/8. It was down
  over three points Wednesday morning before closing down 7/8.
      "Polaroid is working overtime on production of cameras and
  film, so we expect first quarter earnings to be up about 40
  pct," Ryan said, estimating earnings of 70 cts a share in the
  first quarter compared to 52 cts a share earned a year earlier.
  He expects the company to earn four dlrs a share in 1987 as
  compared to 3.34 dlrs a share last year.
