BRAZILIAN BANK WORKERS DECIDE ON NATIONAL STRIKE
  Brazilian bank workers voted
  to launch a nationwide strike this month, compounding labour
  unrest arising from the failure of the government's
  anti-inflation plan.
      At a rally in this city, about 100 km northwest of Sao
  Paulo, about 5,000 bank workers voted to strike on March 24
  unless their demand for 100 pct pay rises is met.
      Wilson Gomes de Moura, president of the national
  confederation which groups the bank employees' 152 unions
  representing 700,000 workers, told Reuters the indefinite
  stoppage would affect all banks.
      The vote came as a stoppage by seamen entered its third
  week and as 55,000 oil workers threatened action against the
  state-owned petroleum company Petrobras.
