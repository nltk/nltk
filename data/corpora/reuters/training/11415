  Tunisia is expected to tender shortly for
  100,000 tonnes of soft wheat for shipment between April and
  June, covered by COFACE export credits, trade sources said.
      Over 300,000 tonnes of French soft wheat have been sold to
  Tunisia since the beginning of the 1986/87 campaign, of which
  225,000 to 250,000 tonnes have already been shipped, they said.
