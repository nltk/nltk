ZIMBABWE BANS POLYPROPYLENE BAGS FOR OILSEEDS
  Zimbabwe's Grain Marketing Board has
  banned the packing of oilseeds in locally-made polypropylene
  bags and will supply jute bags instead, board officials said.
      It said the quality of oilseeds such as soybeans,
  groundnuts and sunflower seed packed in polypropylene bags
  deteriorated after two weeks.
      Zimbabwe began producing 10 mln polypropylene grain bags
  this year to replace jute bags imported mainly from Bangladesh.
