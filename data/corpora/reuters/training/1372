USDA PROPOSES NAME CHANGES IN BEEF GRADE
  The U.S. Agriculture Department
  proposes to rename the "USDA Good" grade of beef to "USDA Select."
      The department said the proposed change is in response to a
  petition from Public Voice for Food and Health Policy and would
  present a more positive image of this grade of beef and help
  calorie-conscious consumers select leaner cuts of meat.
      Under current rules, the "good" grade of meat has less
  marbling and fat than the "prime" or "choice" grades, it said.
      Standards for all of the grades would remain unchanged
  under the proposal.
