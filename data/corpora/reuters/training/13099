USDA OFFERS EEP BARLEY MALT TO COLOMBIA
  The U.S. Agriculture Department
  announced Colombia has been made eligible for sales of up to
  15,000 tonnes of barley malt under the department's export
  enhancement program, EEP.
      As with the previous 64 EEP initiatives, sales of U.S.
  barley malt would be made to buyers in Colombia at competitive
  world prices, USDA said.
      The export sales would be subsidized with commodities from
  the inventory of the Commodity Credit Corp and enable U.S.
  exporters to compete at commercial prices in the Colombian
  market, USDA said.
