STANLEY INTERIORS &lt;STHF> SAYS RESULTS REDUCED
  Stanley Interiors Corp said
  its first quarter shipments and operating income were lower
  than expected due to snowstorms in January and February that
  forced the closing of some of its manufacturing facilities for
  up to six days.
      Stanley said, however, that any reduction in first quarter
  operating income will be offset by reduced interest expense and
  that first quarter net income will be about flat with first
  quarter 1986 net income of 14 cts a share, or 286,000 dlrs.
      Stanely also said the first quarter's sales losses would be
  made up by shipments in the second quarter.
