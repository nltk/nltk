BRAZIL CROP WEATHER SUMMARY -- USDA/NOAA
  Wet weather covered Rio Grande do
  Sul, Brazil in the week ended March 14, benefitting soybeans
  which are mostly setting to filling pods, the Joint
  Agricultural weather Facility of the U.S. Agriculture and
  Commerce Departments said.
      In its International Weather and Crop Summary, the agency
  said minimal precipitation covered soybean areas in Santa
  Catarina, Parana, and southern Matto Grosso do Sul.
      Adequate soil moisture in these areas met crop moisture
  demands, reducing the potential for crop stress, it said.
      The agency said February precipitation was above normal
  over most soybean areas of Brazil.
      Weekly temperatures were below normal, it said.
