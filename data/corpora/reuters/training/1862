PIEDMONT &lt;PIE> TAKES NO ACTION
  Piedmont Aviation Inc said
  its board meeting recessed today without taking action on
  proposals to combine Piedmont with other corporations.
      Piedmont has received opposing bids from Norfolk Southern
  Corp and US Air Corp.
      Earlier today, Trans World Airlines Inc offered to either
  buy Piedmont suitor US Air or, alternatively, to merge with
  Piedmont and U.S. Air.
      IN a prepared statement, Piedmont said there would be no
  further announcements concerning this situation today.
      The company declined to say when the board would meet
  again.
