LLOYDS BANK MATCHES BASE RATE CUT TO 10.5 PCT
  Lloyds Bank Plc said it is cutting its
  base lending rate to 10.5 pct from 11 pct, effective tomorrow.
      The reduction follows similar moves from the three other
  British clearing banks.
      National Westminster Bank Plc led the way this morning
  after the Bank of England lowered its dealing rates in a signal
  that it would tolerate a half percentage point reduction.
      The central bank's surprise signal followed its strenuous
  efforts last week to prevent market forces from bringing down
  base rates before the U.K. Budget on March 17.
