S.A.Y.&lt;SAYI> TO TAKE 3RD QTR LOSS FROM SALE
  S.A.Y. Industries Inc said it
  expects a loss of about two mln dlrs in its third quarter ended
  February 28 from the proposed sale of its Omnilab Inc health
  care unit.
      S.A.Y said its board of directors approved the unit's sale
  because Omnilab was losing about 140,000 dlrs a quarter.
      "We no longer see a near-term prospect for a reasonable
  return on our investment," Romilly Humphries, S.A.Y. president
  and chief executive officer said.
      S.A.Y. said proceeds from the sale would be used to
  increase the company's market share in automotive products
  packaging and diversify its packaging capabilities.
