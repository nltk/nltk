JACOBS SUCHARD EXPECTS ANOTHER EXCELLENT YEAR
  Jacobs Suchard AG &lt;JACZ.Z> hopes for
  another excellent year in 1987 after a 27 pct increase in 1986
  net profit. Results in the first few months show it heading in
  the right direction, company president Klaus Jacobs said.
      The group reported 1986 net profit of 190.9 mln Swiss
  francs compared with 150.4 mln in 1985 and raised its dividend
  per bearer share to 160 francs from 155 francs.
      Jacobs said the increase in profit, which far exceeded the
  company's target of five pct real annual growth, had been made
  possible by restructuring measures introduced in January 1986
  which had also made some major acquisitions possible last year.
      Hermann Pohl, general director in charge of economic
  affairs, said the 2.7 pct decline in group turnover to 5.24
  billion francs was due to currency factors.
      A 5.2 pct negative currency influence was partially offset
  by growth in operations and by structural changes within the
  group.
      Turnover in the coffee business fell to 3.10 billion francs
  from 3.56 billion in 1985 while turnover in the chocolate
  sector rose to 2.14 billion francs from 1.82 billion. The
  tonnage sold in both sectors declined due to higher prices and
  lower consumer demand, especially in France and West Germany.
      Jacobs Suchard increased its market share in West Germany
  to 44.9 pct from 39.9 pct in 1985, largely as a result of
  acquisitions. Market share in France was little changed at 25
  pct against 25.3 pct.
      Pohl said the group's average tax rate rose to 32.5 pct
  from 28.8 pct because of the higher profits and despite
  write-offs on the losses of new acquisitions. A further
  increase in tax levels was expected in future.
      Taxes jumped 51.3 pct to 92 mln francs in 1986 from 61 mln
  the previous year.
