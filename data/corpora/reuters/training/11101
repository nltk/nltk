DIXONS GROUP, AUDIO/VIDEO &lt;AVA> END LITIGATION
  Dixons Group PLC said that pursuant to
  an agreement with Audio/Video Affiliates Inc, part of an
  investor group that made a rival bid for Cyclops Corp &lt;CYL>,
  all litigation between them has been dismissed.
      As part of the agreement, Dixons said Cyacq Corp, the
  Audio/Video investor group that includes Citicorp Capital
  Investors Ltd, agreed to "promptly" terminate its existing
  tender offer for all outstanding Cyclops common at 92.50 dlrs
  per share.
      Dixons said it agreed to pay an additional 4.75 dlrs per
  share, or 95 dlrs per share, to each shareholder whose shares
  were purchased under its offer for Cyclops at 90.25 dlrs per
  share.
      On Friday, Dixons announced that it had increased its
  holdings in Cyclops Corp to about 83 pct of the currently
  outstanding shares and that it intended to increase to 95 dlrs
  from 90.25 dlrs the amount per share paid in the merger of a
  Dixons subsidiary with Cyclops.
