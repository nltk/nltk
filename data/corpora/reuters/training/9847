BRITISH POLITICIANS URGE JAPAN TRADE SANCTIONS
  One hundred members of Britain's ruling
  Conservative Party have signed a motion calling for trade
  sanctions against Japan to force Tokyo to open its domestic
  market to British goods.
      The government announced last week that Japan had a 5.9
  billion dlr trade surplus with Britain in 1986.
      The Department of Trade and Industry said the government
  was drawing up contingency plans to force Japan into opening up
  its domestic markets but a spokesman said such moves were very
  much a last resort.
      Ideas being considered included blocking Japanese companies
  from trading in Britain and revoking licenses of Japanese
  operations in the London financial district.
