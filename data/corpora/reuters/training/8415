TIN PACT SPECIAL SESSION THIS WEEK ROUTINE
  A further special session of the
  International Tin Council, ITC, held here tomorrow, March 24,
  will give member countries an update on the latest debate over
  the hundreds of millions of sterling lost when its buffer stock
  price support scheme failed in October 1985, delegates said.
      But the ITC quarterly session scheduled for April 8-9 will
  be important, as the council will by then be wanting to decide
  on whether the current pact should be extended beyond June 30
  or just allowed to expire, delegates said. A two year extension
  is possible.
