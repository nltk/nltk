TREASURY SECRETARY BAKER DECLINES COMMENT ON G-6
  U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker
  declined comment on the February 22 Paris accord between the
  six major industrial nations under which they agreed to foster
  exchange rate stability.
      Asked by reporters after a speech before the National
  Fitness Foundation banquet what, if any, currency intervention
  levels had been set in Paris, Baker replied: "We never talk
  about intervention."
      Baker also declined to comment on his views about the
  foreign exchange markets' reaction to the accord.
