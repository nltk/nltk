LINDNER SAYS HE DISCUSSED CONTROL OF TAFT &lt;TFB>
  Financier Carl Lindner, who holds a
  16.2 pct stake in Taft Broadcasting Co, told the Securities and
  Exchange Commission he has discussed with the company the
  possibility of seeking control of it.
      Lindner, the Cincinnati, Ohio, investor who controls
  American Financial Corp, said his talks with some of Taft's
  managers and directors have been aimed at "achieving an
  increased ownership position" in the company.
      Lindner said his increase in ownership would be made either
  by making an offer to acquire control of Taft or taking part in
  a group to acquire the company.
      Lindner, who holds his Taft stake through American
  Financial and its subsidiaries, said he is also considering
  buying more Taft stock on the open market or in private deals.
      He did not say whether the talks with Taft officials led to
  any agreements or understandings.
      But Lindner said he intends to review his investment in
  Taft and may be involved in further talks or take other steps
  regarding the future control and direction of Taft.
      Lindner's investor group recently raised its Taft stake to
  1,489,298 shares, or 16.2 pct from 1,439,498 shares, or 15.6
  pct, after buying 49,800 shares for a total of 5.8 mln dlrs.
      Although he recently received clearance from the Federal
  Trade Commission to raise his stake in the company to 24.9 pct,
  Lindner in previous SEC filings has always stressed that his
  interest in Taft was for investment only and not was not
  seeking to control the company.
      An investor group headed by members of the wealthy Bass
  family of Fort Worth, Texas, also holds about 24.9 pct of
  Taft's common stock.
