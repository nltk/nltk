CARGILL STRIKE TALKS CONTINUING TODAY
  Further talks will be held this morning
  at Cargill U.K. Ltd's oilseed processing plant at Seaforth,
  after yesterday's meeting between management and unions failed
  to produce a solution to end the three month old strike, a
  company spokesman said.
      Talks will be extended to tomorrow if there is no
  breakthrough in today's session, he said.
