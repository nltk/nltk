BAIRD &lt;BATM> GETS TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER
  Baird Corp said the Massachusetts state
  court for Suffolk county has granted it a temporary restraining
  order prohibiting Mark IV Industries Inc &lt;IV> from further
  purchases of Baird stock until Mark IV complies with the
  Massachusetts Anti-Takeover Statute.
      The company said Mark IV currently owns at least 17.6 pct
  of Baird stock and has indicated that it may attempt to acquire
  Baird.
      Baird said the U.S. District Court in Boston has denied
  Mark IV's application for a temporary restraining order to
  prevent enforcement of the Massachusetts takeover law.
