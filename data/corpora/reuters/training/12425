CARGILL U.K. STRIKE TALKS BREAK OFF WITHOUT RESULT
  Two days of talks between management and
  unions to try to end the 3-1/2 month labour dispute at Cargill
  U.K. Ltd's oilseed crushing plant at Seaforth ended yesterday
  without resolving the situation, a company spokesman said.
      Fresh talks are expected to be held early next week but the
  actual date has not yet been fixed, he added.
      Oilseed processing at the mill has been at a standstill
  since December 19 and the company has declared force majeure
  for deliveries of soymeal and soyoil ahead to May.
