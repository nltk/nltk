DU PONT &lt;DD> TO SELL CLEVELAND PLANT
  Du Pont Co said it agreed to
  sell its Cleveland chemical plant, the oldest site currently
  operated by the company, to two employees.
      Terms were not disclosed.
      Closing is expected in the second quarter, following
  approval of definitive agreements.
      Products made at the plant represent less than 1/10 of one
  pct of Du Pont's annual sales, it said. Quilon chrome complexes
  and Volan bonding agents will be supplied by the plant to Du
  Pont under contract.
      Established in 1866, the plant was acquired by Du Pont in
  1928. The plant no longer fits the company's long-term
  strategy, Du Pont said
