RAIMOND EXPECTS EC-GULF PROBLEMS WILL BE SOLVED
  French Foreign Minister Jean-Bernard
  Raimond predicted in a published interview a successful end to
  negotiations to admit Gulf petrochemical exports into the
  European Community (EC).
      Negotiations have been under way between the Community and
  the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) for three years.
      Raimond, due here tomorrow from Oman for his first official
  visit to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), told the semi-official
  daily Al-Ittihad he was confident a solution would soon be
  reached.
      "I am confident that problems between the two big partners,
  the GCC and the EC, will find a solution. I will work to reach
  that solution," he said in the interview conducted in Paris.
      An EC decision to impose tariffs on Gulf petrochemical
  exports over a set quota has strained trade relations between
  the two sides.
      GCC members Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the UAE
  and Oman are threatening to impose heavy customs duties on
  European exports to the Gulf if no solution is reached.
      Raimond said negotiations between the two groups took a
  long time because there were 20 countries involved. But added:
  "Time is now ripe and all circumstances are appropriate for
  making crucial progress."
      Referring to the Iran-Iraq war, he said efforts should
  continue to find a solution despite prevailing difficulties.
      He said France was continuing negotiations with Iran. Some
  problems were solved as a result of the contacts while others
  remained unresolved. He gave no details but said: "France wishes
  to have normal relations with Iran."
