STARREX LINKS SHARE PRICE TO ASSAY SPECULATION
  &lt;Starrex Mining Corp Ltd> said a sharp
  
  rise in its share price is based on speculation for favorable
  results from its current underground diamond drilling program
  at its 35 pct owned Star Lake gold mine in northern
  Saskatchewan.
      Starrex Mining shares rose 40 cts to 4.75 dlrs in trading
  on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
      The company said drilling results from the program which
  started in late February are encouraging, "but it is too soon
  for conclusions." Starrex did not disclose check assay results
  from the exploration program.
