KANSAS LEGISLATOR PREDICTS EEP WHEAT TO SOVIETS
  Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., predicted
  the Reagan administration within the next ten days to two weeks
  will offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union under the
  Export Enhancement Program, EEP.
      Roberts made the comment at a press conference held by
  Republican members of the House Agriculture Committee.
      He did not say on what he based the comment, but an aide
  said Roberts had been in touch with top Republican officials
  recently.
      The possibility of an expansion of EEP to include wheat to
  Moscow has been rumored for some time, and some industry
  sources believe a decision on the issue will be made by the
  Reagan administration before Secretary of State George Shultz
  goes to Moscow in April.
