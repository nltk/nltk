WORLD GRAIN TRADE RECOVERY MAY BE UNDERWAY
  World grain trade could be turning
  the corner and heading toward recovery in the 1986-87 season, a
  Cargill, Inc. analyst said.
      Writing in the March issue of the Cargill Bulletin, David
  Rogers of Cargill's Commodity Marketing Division cited a
  gradual rise in world wheat trade in recent months, with a slow
  rise in wheat prices after recent historic lows.
      He said the wheat trade, because wheat can be produced in
  many nations, is a good barometer of world grain trade and
  could lead to more activity in other grain markets.
      Rogers said that with world grain prices at their lowest
  level in over a quarter of a century in real terms, demand has
  begun to rise while producing nations are re-examining their
  expensive price-support policies and reducing planted acres.
