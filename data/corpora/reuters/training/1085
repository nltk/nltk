COFFEE TALKS COLLAPSE EASES NEED FOR U.S. BILL
  The collapse of International Coffee
  Organization, ICO, talks on export quotas yesterday removes the
  immediate need to reinstate U.S. legislation allowing the
  customs service to monitor coffee imports, analysts here said.
      The Reagan administration proposed in trade legislation
  offered Congress last month that authority to monitor coffee
  imports be resumed. That authority lapsed in September 1986. A
  bill also was introduced by Rep. Frank Guarini (D-N.J.).
      However, the failure of the ICO talks in London to reach
  agreement on export quotas means the U.S. legislation is not
  immediately needed, one analyst said. Earlier supporters of the
  coffee bill hoped it could be passed by Congress quickly.
      "You're going to have a hard time convincing Congress (now)
  this is an urgent issue," the coffee analyst said.
