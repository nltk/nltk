ZIMBABWE COFFEE OUTPUT SET TO RISE
  Zimbabwean coffee output will reach
  13,000 tonnes this year, up on just over 11,000 tonnes produced
  in 1986, the Commercial Coffee Growers Association said.
      Administrative Executive Robin Taylor told the domestic
  news agency ZIANA that Zimbabwe earned the equivalent of 33 mln
  U.S. Dlrs from coffee exports last year. He would not say how
  much the country would earn in 1987.
      Taylor said the 173 commercial coffee growers under his
  association had increased production from 5,632 tonnes in 1980
  to more than 11,000 tonnes in l986.
