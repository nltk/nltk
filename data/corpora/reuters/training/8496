CAESARS &lt;CAW> HAS NO COMMENT ON MTS TALKS
  Caesars World Inc declined
  immediate comment on news that Martin Sosnoff's &lt;MTS
  Acquisition Corp> has held preliminary talks with two companies
  on the possibility of forming a joint venture to pursue the
  acquisition of Caesars.
      Earlier today MTS said it held talks with Pratt Hotel Corp
  &lt;PRAT> and Southmark Corp &lt;SM> on forming a venture to acquire
  Caesars.
      MTS also reported that it received a "negligible" number of
  Caesars World shares in response to its 28 dlr per share tender
  offer.
      Earlier this month Caesars World rejected the Sosnoff
  takeover bid and said it is considering alternatives that
  include a restructuring or sale of the company to another
  party.
