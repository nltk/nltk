EUROPE SHIPPING EXPORTS TO S AFRICA OFF 40 PCT
  The volume of European exports to
  South Africa carried by container line vessels has declined 40
  pct in the last two years, British shipping executive Antony
  Butterwick said.
      Butterwick told reporters that despite the drop and low
  freight rates, the shipping conference he heads will increase
  the frequency of sailings to South Africa as a "very strong act
  of faith and confidence" in the country's future.
      He is chairman of the Europe South and South-East African
  Conference Lines and joint managing director of P and O
  Containers Ltd.
      A statement issued by the conference here said frequency of
  Southern Africa/Europe container service sailings is being
  increased from nine to seven days.
      "This is the most positive development on the shipping front
  between South Africa and its main trading partners in Europe
  for more than four years, when the service last operated
  weekly," it said.
