INDIA BOUGHT AT LEAST EIGHT CARGOES SUGAR--TRADE
  India bought eight cargoes of white
  sugar at a buying tender this week but also gave sellers
  options to sell an extra eight cargoes at the same prices,
  traders said.
      Four international firms shared the business which gave
  each of them sales of two cargoes of Mar/Apr shipment sugar at
  233 dlrs CIF and options on two cargoes of Apr/May.
      This brings recent options India has given traders to some
  200,000 tonnes at fixed prices and makes future Indian
  purchases very dependent on price fluctuations, traders said.
      At 233 dlrs CIF the sugar sold this week was at a discount
  of up to 10 dlrs to current prices, some traders said.
