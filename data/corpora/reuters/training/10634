CHINA FOREIGN RESERVES EXCEED 10 BILLION DLRS
  China's foreign exchange reserves are
  more than 10 billion dlrs, enough to cover import payments for

      He told a news conference that China also has considerable
  reserves of gold. He gave no figure.
      The last published figure for foreign exchange reserves was
