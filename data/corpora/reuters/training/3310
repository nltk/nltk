LCE AND IPE ELECT FIRST TRADED OPTIONS MEMBERS
  The first 23 members have been elected to
  the joint traded options facility of the London Commodity
  Exchange (LCE) and the International Petroleum exchange (IPE),
  the exchanges said in a statement.
      More firms have applied and the final tranche will be
  admitted on April one and trading is planned to start in early
  June on the new trading floor on Commodity Quay.
      Traded options need a volatile and liquid futures base to
  succeed and chairman of the joint formation committee Jack
  Patterson said the existing LCE cocoa, coffee, sugar and IPE
  gas oil contracts should have no difficulty in providing this.
