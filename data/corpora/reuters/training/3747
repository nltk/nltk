  SHV Holdings NV said it is
  withdrawing its take-over bid for Imperial Continental Gas
  Association &lt;ICGS.L> after failing to gain the minimum number
  of pledges sought from IC Gas shareholders.
      SHV said in a statement it had sought to gain 750,000 IC
  Gas shares under a 700p offer for IC Gas ordinary stock but was
  informed that level was not reached when the deadline expired.
  "The tender offer is therefore void," it said.
       SHV also offered 252 pence for every one stg nominal of IC
