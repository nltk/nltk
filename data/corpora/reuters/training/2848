U.S. FEEDGRAINS GROUP ATTACKS CANADA CORN RULING
  The U.S. Feedgrains Council is
  surprised and disappointed by the Canadian Import Tribunal's
  decision that imports of corn from the U.S. are materially
  injuring Canadian corn producers, a council spokesman said.
      "At a time when the world is attempting to liberalize trade
  in the new rounnd of multilateral negotiations, it is
  incomprehensible that a country that stands to gain so much
  from the reduction in agricultural trade barriers would
  threaten that process by caving in to pressures for
  protectionism," council president Darwin E. Stolte said.
      Canada's finding will strain the U.S./Canadian trading
  relationship, could damage the future of U.S. feedgrains 
  support for the free trade negotiations, and also negatively
  impact farm trade reform with other nations, the council said.
