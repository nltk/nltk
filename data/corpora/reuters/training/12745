U.K. MONEY MARKET DEFICIT FORECAST AT 700 MLN STG
  The Bank of England said it has forecast
  a shortage of around 700 mln stg in the system today.
      Among the main factors, maturing assistance and take-up of
  treasury bills will drain 546 mln stg, bills for repurchase by
  the market 76 mln, a rise in note circulation 310 mln and
  bankers balances below target 105 mln.
      The outflow will be partly offset by 340 mln stg exchequer
  transactions.
