METROMAIL &lt;MTMA> PREDICTS FLAT EARNINGS
  Metromail Corp said it expects
  flat operating profits for its 1987 fiscal year ending May 31
  with last fiscal year's earnings from operations of 9,943,000
  dlrs, or 1.05 dlrs a share.
      The company said the flat results will be due to higher
  than normal expenditures during the fourth quarter for
  expansion of its data processing capabilities.
      Earlier, Metromail reported fiscal 1987 third quarter
  earnings of 2.4 mln dlrs, or 25 cts a share, versus three mln
  dlrs, or 32 cts a share, the prior third quarter, and nine
  months net of 7.2 mln dlrs, or 76 cts a share, versus 7.8 mln
  dlrs, or 82 cts a share the prior nine months.
