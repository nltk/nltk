INDIAN SUGAR OUTPUT RISES IN FIRST FOUR MONTHS
  India's sugar output to January 31 in
  the 1986/87 season (October/September) rose to 3.66 mln tonnes
  from 3.46 mln in the same 1985/86 period, the Indian Sugar
  Mills Association said.
      Total offtake in the first four months of the current year
  was 2.71 mln tonnes (including 241,000 tonnes imported) for
  domestic use and 4,000 tonnes for export, against 2.81 mln

  tonnes for export in the corresponding period of 1985/86.
      Factory stocks at end-January were 3.05 mln tonnes (96,000
  imported) against 3.13 mln (96,000 imported) a year earlier.
