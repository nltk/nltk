BALL &lt;BLL> TO SUPPLY PENNY BLANKS TO MINTS
  Ball Corp said it was awarded a
  one-year 12,750,000 dlr contract to supply copper-plated zinc
  penny blanks to the U.S. mints in Philadelphia and Denver.
      The new contract, effective in June, calls for shipping
  23,200,000 pounds of blanks to the mint in Philadelphia and
  7,600,000 pounds to Denver. It said the blanks will be

  zinc from copper.
