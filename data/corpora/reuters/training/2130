MCI &lt;MCIC> PRESIDENT SEES PROFIT IMPROVEMENT
  MCI Communications Corp President
  Bert Roberts said he expects MCI's financial performance to
  improve in the current quarter compared to the previous
  quarter.
      He said American Telephone and Telegraph Co long-distance
  rate cuts had cut into MCI's fourth quarter performance but
  added: "There's going to be a continuing impact (on profits) but
  we expect this quarter to be better than the fourth quarter."
      The current quarter ends March 31.
      For the fourth quarter, MCI reported a 448 mln dlr loss,
  due mainly to write-offs and staff reductions.
      Roberts said the ATT long-distance rate reductions, which
  had been ordered by the Federal Communications Commission have
  had "A significantly negative impact on our profits."
      As reported earlier today, MCI said it plans to ask the FCC
  to immediately deregulate ATT, apparently in hopes that an
  unregulated ATT would pocket a greater proportion of its
  revenues rather than cut rates further.
