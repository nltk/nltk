JAPAN'S JOBLESS SEEN RISING TO 3.3 PCT IN 1987/88
  The yen's rise against the dollar is
  expected to boost Japan's unemployment rate to an average 3.3
  pct in the 1987/88 fiscal year beginning April 1 from January's
  record three pct, the private Nomura Research Institute said.
      The official 1987/88 estimate is 2.9 pct.
      The research arm of Nomura Securities Co forecast
  unemployment would exceed two mln by mid-fiscal 1987, against
  an estimated 1.75 mln for the current year.
      Nomura urged the government to take pump-priming measures
  to help redress trade imbalances and boost employment.
      Employment in manufacturing during fiscal 1987/88 was
  predicted to fall 550,000 from the current year due to higher
  job losses in the steel, shipbuilding and heavy electrical
  machinery sectors, Nomura said.
      Employment in the non-manufacturing sector will continue to
  increase, the institute said, without giving figures.
