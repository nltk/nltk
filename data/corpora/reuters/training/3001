U.K. MONEY MARKET SHORTAGE FORECAST AT 250 MLN STG
  The Bank of England said it forecast a
  shortage of around 250 mln stg in the money market today.
      Among the factors affecting liquidity, it said bills
  maturing in official hands and the treasury bill take-up would
  drain around 1.02 billion stg while below target bankers'
  balances would take out a further 140 mln.
      Against this, a fall in the note circulation would add 345
  mln stg and the net effect of exchequer transactions would be
  an inflow of some 545 mln stg, the Bank added.
