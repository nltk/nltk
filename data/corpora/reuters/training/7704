ILLINOIS REGIONAL &lt;ILLR> MULLS AFFILIATION
  Illinois Regional Bancorp said
  it is evaluating whether to affiliate with a larger bank
  holding company or continue to remain independent.
      The 500 mln dlr-asset bank holding company said that in
  view of recent investor interest in suburban Chicago banks, it
  retained Merrill Lynch Capital markets to advise it on its
  alternatives.
      Last year, Illinois Regional had discussions with
  Milwaukee-based Marine Corp &lt;MCRP> but no agreement was
  reached, a company spokesman said.
