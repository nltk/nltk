FRENCH HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION FALLS IN FEBRUARY
  French household consumption of
  industrial goods fell 1.1 pct seasonally adjusted to 21.32
  billion francs last month from 21.55 billion in January, the
  National Statistics Institute (INSEE) said.
      This brought consumption back down to the December 1986
  level, it added.
      INSEE said that the fall was due to a sharp decline in
  purchases of clothing, which were high in January due to the
  cold weather. The decline was partly compensated by a small
  rise in purchases of durable goods.
