U.K. MONEY MARKET DEFICIT FORECAST AT 800 MLN STG
  The Bank of England said it forecast a
  shortage of around 800 mln stg in the money market today.
      Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing
  in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain
  around 1.18 billion stg while bankers balances below target
  will take out some 20 mln stg.
      Partly offseting these outflows, a fall in note circulation
  and exchequer transactions will add some 355 and 55 mln stg to
  the system respectively.
