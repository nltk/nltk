U.S. ASKS JAPAN END AGRICULTURE IMPORT CONTROLS
  The U.S. Wants Japan to eliminate import
  controls on agricultural products within three years, visiting
  U.S. Under-Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Allen Wallis
  told Eishiro Saito, Chairman of the Federation of Economic
  Organisations (Keidanren), a spokesman for Keidanren said.
      The spokesman quoted Wallis as saying drastic measures
  would be needed to stave off protectionist legislation by
  Congress.
      Wallis, who is attending a sub-cabinet-level bilateral
  trade meeting, made the remark yesterday in talks with Saito.
      Wallis was quoted as saying the Reagan Administration wants
  Japanese cooperation so the White House can ensure any U.S.
  Trade bill is a moderate one, rather than containing
  retaliatory measures or antagonising any particular country.
      He was also quoted as saying the U.S. Would be pleased were
  Japan to halve restrictions on agricultural imports within five
  years if the country cannot cope with abolition within three,
  the spokesman said.
      Japan currently restricts imports of 22 agricultural
  products. A ban on rice imports triggered recent U.S.
  Complaints about Japan's agricultural policy.
