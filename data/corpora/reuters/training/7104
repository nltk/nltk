DROUGHT MAY REDUCE ZIMBABWE COFFEE OUTPUT -GROWERS
  Zimbabwe's projected coffee output of
  13,000 tonnes for 1987/88 could be reduced by drought, growers
  said.
      The main coffee growing areas in eastern Zimbabwe have
  received little rain since April 1986 and the Coffee Growers'
  Association has begun a survey to assess the effects of the
  drought, a spokesman said.
      Zimbabwe exported 11,000 tonnes of coffee in 1986, mainly
  to West Germany, Britain, Japan, the Netherlands, Switzerland
  and the United States.
