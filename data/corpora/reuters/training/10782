U.S. BANKER PREDICTS FURTHER DOLLAR FALL THIS YEAR
  A leading U.S. Banker said the dollar
  was likely to fall another five to 10 pct this year and an
  improvement in the huge American trade deficit would be only
  temporary at current world exchange rate levels.
      Kurt Viermetz, worldwide treasurer of Morgan Guaranty Trust
  Co, told Arab currency traders meeting here that the steady
  depreciation of the dollar had not gone far enough to rein in
  U.S. deficits on a lasting basis.
