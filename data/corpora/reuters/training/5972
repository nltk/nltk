SOVIETS SAID TO SEE NEW FLOOR FOR GRAIN OUTPUT
  The intensive technology concept for
  grain production has put a new floor under USSR grain
  production, the U.S. Agriculture Department's officer in Moscow
  said in a field report.
      The report, quoting a broadcast on Radio Moscow, said that
  due to intensive technology grain production in a "bad year" will
  not fall below 200 mln tonnes, and in a "good year" grain
  production could reach 250 mln tonnes.
      The U.S. Agriculture Department currently forecasts this
  year's USSR crop at 210.1 mln tonnes, and if realized this
  would be the third year since 1975 that the Soviet Union's
  grain harvest has exceeded 200.0 mln tonnes.
      The largest crop since 1975 was 237.4 mln tonnes harvested
  in 1978, according to USDA data.
