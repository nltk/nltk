NEW DUTCH ADVANCES TOTAL 4.1 BILLION GUILDERS
  The Duth Central bank said it accepted
  bids totalling 4.086 billion guilders at tender for the new
  twelve-day special advances at an unchanged 5.3 pct.
      Bids up to 30 mln guilders were met in full, amounts above
  at 40 pct.
      The new advances, covering the period April 3 to 15,
  replace the current 4.2 billion guilder nine-day facility at
  5.3 pct, which expires today.
      Money market dealers said the total amount allocated was in
  line with expectations and would be sufficient to cover the
  money market shortage for the duration of the facility.
