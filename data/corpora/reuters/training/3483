BELGIAN CENTRAL BANK BUYS CURRENCY TO REPAY DEBT
  The Belgian National Bank bought
  foreign currencies against francs on the open market in the
  week ended March 9, a Bank spokesman said.
      In line with central bank policy he declined to give any
  details of the amount bought.
      The foreign currency purchased was used by the Treasury to
  repay foreign debt and did not affect the Bank's foreign
  exchange reserves. They slipped 394 mln francs to 37.33
  billion, mostly due to sales of dollars for Special Drawing
  Rights, the spokesman said.
