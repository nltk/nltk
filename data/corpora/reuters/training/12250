&lt;CRIME CONTROL> ASSETS TO BE SOLD TO HAWLEY
  Crime Control Inc said it reached a
  definitive agreement under which a subsidiary of Hawley Group
  Ltd will buy assets and assume certain liabilities of Crime
  Control for 51.3 mln dlrs.
      Of this amount, it said about 47 mln dlrs would be
  available for distribution to the company's banks, debenture
  holders and shareholders. The balance would be used to pay
  various state taxes and other expenses relating to the
  transaction, and to establish reserves to provide for certain
  unassumed obligations of the company.
      Crime Control said it would use proceeds to pay its bank
  lenders approximately 28.6 mln dlrs, representing about 87 pct
  of the principal amount of all its indebtedness to bank
  lenders.
      It also said it would propose to acquire all of its 20 mln
  dlrs worth of outstanding 10 pct convertible subordinated
  debentures for an aggregate of approximately 15.4 mln dlrs and
  propose liquidation of the company with shareholders receiving
  an estimated 54 cts a share.
      As reported earlier, Crime Control is in default on
  approximately 33 mln dlrs of bank debt and in default under the
  indenture governing its convertible subordinated debentures.
      On January 19, 1987, Crime Control, which installs,
  services and monitors electronic surveillance systems, said it
  retained Rothschild Inc to arrange for the sale of the company.
