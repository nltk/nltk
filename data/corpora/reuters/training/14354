U.S. WEATHER/COTTON SUMMARY -- USDA/NOAA
  Cotton planting continued progressing
  in the week ended April 5, but cold, wet weather in the South
  hampered seedbed preparation, the Joint Agricultural Weather
  Facility of the U.S. Agriculture and Commerce Departments said.
      In a summary of its Weather and Crops Bulletin, the agency
  said planting increased in California as soil temperatures
  improved.
      Texas planted 10 pct compared with an average of eight pct.
  Arizona and Georgia planted 35 pct and two pct, respectively,
  it said.
      Oklahoma farmers prepared 10 pct of their cotton seedbeds,
  15 points below average, the agency said.
