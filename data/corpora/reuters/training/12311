STRONG DEMAND FOR U.S. CORN IN JAPAN -- USDA
  Japan appears to be relying less on
  corn from China, Argentina and South Africa and more on
  supplies from the United States, the U.S. Agriculture
  Department said.
      In its World Production and Trade report, the department
  said in the past seven weeks reported U.S. corn sales of nearly
  three mln tonnes to Japan are about three times the level
  during this period last year.
      Reports of short Argentine supplies and the apparent
  unwillingness of the Chinese to sell at current world prices
  may have caused Japanese buyers to turn to the United States
  for corn supplies, the department said.
