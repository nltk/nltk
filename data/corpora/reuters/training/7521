SENATE WANTS JAPAN SEMICONDUCTER PACT ENFORCED
  The U.S. Senate has unanimously
  called for President Reagan immediately to force Japan to live
  up to a pledge to stop dumping its microchips and open its
  markets to U.S. Chipmakers.
      The Senate voted 93 to 0 to urge Reagan to impose penalties
  on Japanese high-technology products containing semiconductors
  in retaliation for what it sees as Japan's violations of the
  semiconductor pact.
      While the measure does not bind Reagan to any action,
  Senate leaders said its adoption would warn Japan stiffer
  legislation would be considered if the violations continue.
      "We want to send a message to Japan to let it know how the
  Senate feels about this matter," Senate Democratic Leader Robert
  Byrd told the Senate.
      Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen told the
  Senate the measure was not aimed at retaliation but at
  correcting Japan's unfair trade practices.
      A key House trade lawmaker, Representative Richard Gephardt
  also announced he would seek to force Japan and other countries
  with huge trade surpluses to slash their surplus by 10 pct a
  year for three years.
