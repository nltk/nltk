FRUIT/LOOM &lt;FTL> TO SELL UNIT FOR 145 MLN DLRS
  Fruit of the Loom Inc said it agreed to
  sell its General Battery Corp subsidiary to Exide Corp for
  about 145 mln dlrs in cash.
      The proposed sale will complete Fruit of the Loom's
  previously announced plan to divest itself of unrelated
  businesses.
      Proceeds from the proposed transaction are more than the
  price projected in the company's recent initial public
  offering, it said.
      Completion of the transaction is subject to a definitive
  agreement, regulatory approvals, financing and certain other
  conditions and is expected to close May one, 1987, the company
  said.
