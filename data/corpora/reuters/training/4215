EC COMMISSION HAS OPEN ATTITUDE ON STEEL QUOTAS
  The EC Commission said it was
  adopting an "open attitude" about whether a system of production
  quotas should remain for the indefinite future on heavy steel
  products which account for about 45 pct of all EC steel goods.
      In a statement, the Commission reiterated its view that the
  industry needs to lose between 25 and 30 mln tonnes of capacity
  by 1990. It had previously said the quota system, started in
  1980, should be wound up completely by the end of next year.
      The industry has argued for the maintenance of existing
  quotas, which cover almost 70 pct of all output, saying almost
  all steelmakers are losing money due to the depressed market.
