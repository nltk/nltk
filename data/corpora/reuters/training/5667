DNA MEDICAL &lt;DNAM> SIGNS PACT FOR STOCK SALE
  DNA Medical Inc said Walter G.
  Mize had bought about 9,400,000 shares, or about 33 pct of
  DNA's outstanding stock, for 100,000 dlrs cash.
      Under an agreement with Mize, DNA said he will also become
  chairman, and may, at his option, expand the board to provide
  him equal representation with the current board.
      DNA also said it will submit a proposal at its annual
  meeting for it to acquire three companies owned by Mize,
  &lt;Heritage Lite Meat Corp>, &lt;National Lean Beef Corp> and
  &lt;Heritage Cattle &lt;Corp>. DNA said the total value of the
  transactions is 700,000 dlrs.
      DNA said that when the transactions are approved by its
  shareholders, it will issue additional shares of its common so
  that Mize will own 80 pct of its issued and outstanding stock.
      DNA said Mize will replace its current chairman, Donald
  Holbrook, who will remain on the board.
      The company also said it will continue in the medical
  development business as "long as it is deemed to be
  advantageous."
