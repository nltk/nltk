U.K. RETAIL SALES RISE 2.2 PCT IN FEBRUARY
  The volume of U.K. Retail sales rose a
  provisional, seasonally adjusted 2.2 pct in February after
  falling a final 2.2 pct in January, figures released by the
  Department of Trade and Industry show.
      The February sales index, base 1980, was put at a
  preliminary 125.0 after a final 122.3 in January.
      In the three months from December to February, the level of
  sales was little changed over the previous three months but was
  nearly six pct higher than the same year ago period.
      On a non-seasonally adjusted value basis, retail sales in
  February were a provisional 9.0 pct higher than a year earlier.
      The Department noted the latest figures were similar to the
  average in the fourth quarter last year but well above the
  January index, which was depressed by the effects of severe
  weather.
      The February trading period comprised the four weeks
  February 1 to 28. Final February retail sales figures will be
  published on April 6.
