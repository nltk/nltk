DEUTSCHE BABCOCK TO INCREASE DIVIDEND IN 1986/87
  Deutsche Babcock AG
  &lt;DBCG.F> will increase its dividend on results in the year
  ending September 30, 1987, chief executive Helmut Wiehn said.
      Wiehn told a news conference Deutsche Babcock would double
  the absolute amount it distributes to shareholders. This
  overall increase would also be due partly to an increase of
  nominal share capital by 100 mln marks to 350 mln marks.
      A higher dividend had been anticipated because Deutsche
  Babcock has said in the past that it will only raise capital
  when it can make a lasting improvement in the dividend.
