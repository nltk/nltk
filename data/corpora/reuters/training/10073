      Pillsbury said the sale will occur as soon as practicable,
  considering the business and legal contigencies.
      The company said Burger King and another Pillsbury unit,

      Pillsbury said it expects the interests to be sold to
  public investors and listed for trading on the New York Stock
  Exchange.
      Merrill Lynch will lead the underwriting, Pillsbury said.
      Pillsbury first sold limited partnership interests in
  Burger King Investors L.P. in February 1986.
