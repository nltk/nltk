PIER 1 IMPORTS &lt;PIR> AMENDING DATES ON SPLIT
  Pier 1 Imports Inc said it
  amended its record and distribution dates for its previously-
  announced three-for two common and 25 cts preferred stock
  split.
      The split common and 25 cts preferred shares will be
  distributed on July 2, 1987, to shareholders of record June 24,
  1987.
      The stock split requires shareholder approval of an
  increase in authorized shares of common stock to 100 mln from
  25 mln and an increase of authorized shares of preferred stock
  to five mln from one mln, the company said.
      The change in the dates was based on the company's desire
  to have the additional common and 25 cts preferred shares trade
  for the shortest practical period of time on a "when issued"
  basis following a favorable shareholder vote at the annual
  meeting June 24, it said.
      The previously announced record and distribution dates were
  May 13, 1987, and June 29, 1987, respectively, the company
  said.
