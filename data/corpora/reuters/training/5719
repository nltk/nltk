BANKAMERICA &lt;BAC> CHAIR SAYS BANK TURNING AROUND
  BankAmerica Corp Chairman A.W.
  Clausen said the bank holding company is turning around and is
  back on the road to profitability.
      In a speech to the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce,
  Clausen said he was "absolutely convinced" BankAmerica would
  return to its position of preeminence.
      "Fundamental to achieving that goal is to continue to
  reduce costs dramatically, to get our arms around our loan loss
  problems and begin to reduce charge-offs, and to enhance our
  revenue generation," Clausen said.
      Clausen said he doubts BankAmerica would be in a position
  this year to make any acquisitions or experience any growth.
      He said BankAmerica will continue to reduce staff and
  operations, noting that expense growth in 1986 increased only
  one pct over 1985 expenses.
      Clausen also said it will continue to phase out its
  overseas retail banking and concentrate on wholesale banking,
  with emphasis on a premium list of multinational corporations.
