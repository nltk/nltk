LEVON RESOURCES &lt;LVNVF> GOLD ASSAYS IMPROVED
  Levon Resources Ltd
  said re-checked gold assays from the Howard tunnel on its
  Congress, British Columbia property yielded higher gold grades
  than those reported in January and February.
      It said assays from zone one averaged 0.809 ounces of gold
  a ton over a 40 foot section with an average width of 6.26
  feet. Levon previously reported the zone averaged 0.226 ounces
  of gold a ton over a 40 foot section with average width of 5.16
  feet. Levon said re-checked assays from zone two averaged 0.693
  ounces of gold a ton over a 123 foot section with average width
  of 4.66 feet.
      Levon Resources said the revised zone two assays compared
  to previously reported averages of 0.545 ounces of gold a ton
  over a 103 foot section with average width of 4.302 feet.
      The company also said it intersected another vein 90 feet
  west of zone two, which assayed 0.531 ounces of gold a ton
  across a width of 3.87 feet.
