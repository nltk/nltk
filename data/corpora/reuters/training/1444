JAPAN FIRM DEVELOPS ULTRA HEAT-RESISTING RUBBER
  Shin-Etsu Chemical Co Ltd said it had
  developed an ultra thermal resistance rubber which can be used
  at 250 centigrade continuously without losing its properties.
      Shin-Etsu put potential demand for the product at two
  tonnes a month mainly for microwave ovens and as a sealant.
      But increasing use of the product in parts attached to car
  engines will raise demand and the company will boost output to
  10 tonnes by March 1988 from two now, he said.
