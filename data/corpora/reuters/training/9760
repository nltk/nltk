SIEMENS SEES SALES NEAR 52 BILLION MARKS THIS YEAR
  World group turnover of Siemens AG
  &lt;SIEG.F> should rise to 51 or 52 billion marks in the current
  year to September 31 after a 19 pct upturn in the first five
  months, management board chairman Karlheinz Kaske said.
      Siemens reported world group turnover in 1985/86 of 47.02
  billion marks.
      Kaske told the annual shareholders meeting turnover rose to
  21.2 billion marks in the first five months of 1986/87, about
  19 pct above the same year-ago period. The rise was mainly due
  to payment in January for a West German nuclear power station
  which led to a jump in domestic sales of 36 pct.
      In the first five 1986/87 months, turnover abroad showed a
  three pct increase, Kaske said, without giving figures.
      In the same period incoming orders rose five pct to 21.8
  billion marks against the same 1985/86 period.
      For the year as a whole incoming orders should rise between
  one and two billion marks to around 51 or 52 billion.
      Apart from payments for the nuclear power station, the
  communications and telecommunications sectors in particular
  should contribute to growth this year, Kaske said.
      But it was not possible to make a profit forecast for
  1986/87 because of uncertainty about the direction of the
  dollar, Kaske said.
      Siemens already reported that first quarter 1986/87 group
  net profit fell marginally to 296 mln marks from 298 mln in the
  same period in the previous year.
      Turnover in the first five months rose particularly
  strongly in the installations and automotive technology,
  communications and telecommunications sectors, but components
  and energy and automation showed a sharp decline.
      Kaske said domestic orders rose to 10.2 billion marks in
  the first five months of this year, or nine pct above their
  level in the same 1985/86 period, boosted in particular by
  orders for the fully owned Kraftwerk Union AG subsidiary.
      Foreign orders grew one pct to 11.6 billion marks. An
  increase in orders through newly acquired subsidiaries abroad
  was balanced by the decline in the dollar.
      While the installations and automotive technology sector
  showed a sharp rise in orders, energy and automation and
  communications orders were below the level achieved in the same
  period of 1985/86.
      Telecommunications orders remained at roughly the same
  level.
      Kaske said investments were expected to remain around six
  billion marks in 1986/87 after a 50 pct increase the previous
  year. Research and development were likely to rise 13 pct to
  6.1 billion marks or around 12 pct of turnover.
