SNC GROUP EXPECTS HIGHER 1987 EARNINGS, SALES
  &lt;SNC Group Inc> expects 1987 earnings
  to rise to 1.20-1.40 dlrs a share from 91 cts a share last
  year, with revenues climbing to about 430 mln dlrs from last
  year's 350 mln dlrs, president Alex Taylor said before the
  annual meeting.
      SNC, Canada's second biggest engineering and construction
  group, became the country's largest ammunition manufacturer
  last year with its 90 mln dlr acquisition of Canadian Arsenals
  Ltd from the Canadian government.
      The impact of that and several smaller deals will be felt
  fully in 1987, Taylor said.
      Defense preoducts and other manufacturing operations will
  account for more than half SNC's total 1987 revenues, helping
  to counterbalance the more cyclical engineering and
  construction acivities, Taylor said.
      Last year, SNC earned 8.7 mln dlrs, including a small
  extraordinary gain.
      In 1987, a total manufacturing activities will generate
  about 235 mln dlrs in revenues, and engineering and
  construction about 200 mln dlrs, he said, adding that defense
  products operations should be a major contributor to earnings.
