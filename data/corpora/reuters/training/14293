U.S. SAYS NO PACT ON RELIEF FOR POOREST STATES
  There is no consensus so far among
  industrial countries on an agreement providing debt relief for
  the world's poorest nations, a senior U.S. Treasury official
  said.
      The official said, "There has not been a consensus reached
  yet," when asked about reports the Paris club of western
  creditors had agreed to long-term stretch outs of African debt
  at concessional interest rates.
      The official, briefing reporters on this week's semiannual
  IMF meetings, said the issue would be discussed this week and
  the U.S. had an open mind on the proposal but it did object to
  concessional interest rate relief.
