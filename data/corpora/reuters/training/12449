RANK MAKES INCREASED AVANA OFFER FINAL
  Ranks Hovis McDougall Plc &lt;RHML.L> said
  it was making an increased and final offer for the Avana Group
  Plc &lt;AVNA.L>. The company already holds about 22.9 pct or 7.1
  mln Avana ordinary shares.
      It said in a statement the terms of the offer will be 13
  new Rank Hovis shares for every five Avana ordinary shares,
  valuing each Avana share at 829p.
      Avana shareholders will be entitled to receive and retain
  the net interim dividend of 5.25p per Avana share for the year
  ending 28 March 1987.
      Accepting Avana shareholders will also be entitled to
  receive Ranks Hovis's forecast net interim dividend of 2.65p
  for the financial year ending 5 September 1987.
      Ranks Hovis said that full acceptance of the increased
  offer would result in the issue of a maximum of 72.3 mln new
  Ranks Hovis shares or about 20 pct of the enlarged issued
  ordinary share capital of the company.
      The latest offer will lapse on 17 April. Ordinary
  shareholders in Avana who accept the increased offer will have
  the opportunity to elect for cash for all or part of their
  holdings on the basis of 800p cash for each Avana share.

  would be met by one of several methods.

  cash alternative, Ranks Hovis would make a cash payment from
  its own resources.
      For cash alternatives of more than 10 mln Avana shares,
  Morgan Grenfell, as agent for participants, will make a
  separate offer to purchase at 300p per share, net of expenses,
  up to 46.3 mln Ranks Hovis new shares to which such
  shareholders will be entitled under the increased offer. This
