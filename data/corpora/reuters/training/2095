NO SOVIET WHEAT BONUS TALK PLANNED FOR MEETING
  U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
  Lyng does not intend to discuss a wheat export enhancement
  initiative to the Soviet Union at a cabinet-level Economic
  Policy Council meeting set for tomorrow, an aide to Lyng said.
      "He (Lyng) does not intend to bring it up," the aide said,
  adding that the subsidy offer remains "dormant."
      Lyng plans to spend "about five minutes" reviewing the status
  of farm legislation on Capitol Hill before the Economic Policy
  Council, which is responsible for guiding the administration's
  economic policy, the aide said.
      The USDA secretary met this morning with members of the
  House Foreign Affairs Committee, but the handful of lawmakers
  present did not ask whether the administration intended to
  offer Moscow a wheat export bonus, the aide said.
