INDIA, AUSTRALIA AGREE TO IMPROVE TWO-WAY TRADE
  Indian and Australian businessmen
  signed a memorandum of understanding to boost two-way trade and
  joint industrial ventures in both countries, spokesmen of the
  Indo-Australia Business Council told reporters.
      The Indian Council said it hoped India's exports to
  Australia would improve in the next few months and reduce the
  trade balance which is heavily in Australia's favour.
      In 1986 Australia sold 428 mln Australian dlrs' worth of
  goods, including steel and coking coal, to India and bought
  170.5 mln worth of items, including cotton textiles, from India.
