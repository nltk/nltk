U.K. MONEY MARKET SHORTAGE FORECAST AT 300 MLN STG
  The Bank of England said it forecast a
  liquidity shortage of around 300 mln stg in the market today.
      Among the main factors, the Bank said bills maturing in
  official hands and the treasury bill take-up would drain 483
  mln stg from the system while below target bankers' balances
  and a rise in the note circulation would take out 50 mln and
  100 mln stg respectively.
      Partially offsetting these, exchequer transactions would
  add around 355 mln stg, the Bank added.
