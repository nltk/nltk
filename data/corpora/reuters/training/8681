FRENCH EMPLOYERS CHIEF SEES HOPE FOR GROWTH
  The 1992 deadline for abolishing economic
  barriers within the European Community should help French
  economic growth and create jobs, president of the French
  employers' federation CNPF Francois Perigot said.
      "Having a market at our disposal which is as homogeneous and
  accessible as that of Europe is an incredible piece of luck," he
  told Le Figaro in an interview.
      He said that the majority of French business leaders were
  enthusiastic about the abolition of barriers and saw it as an
  opportunity rather than a danger for their companies.
      "It can permit us to return to a growth rate which is much
  better than we could achieve in isolation. We know that we have
  to reestablish growth at three pct a year to solve the enormous
  problems confronting us -- and I am referring mainly to
  unemployment," Perigot added.
      Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said yesterday that
  French growth would be just two pct this year, the same as last
  year and compared with the government's original 2.8 pct
  target.
