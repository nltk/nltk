U.S. SENATE LEADERS SEE NO TRADE WAR BREWING
  The Senate's Democratic and 
  Republican leaders praised President Reagan for retaliating
  against Japan for violating a semiconducter accord but dashed
  cold water on ideas it was the first shot in a trade war.
      Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd and Republican leader
  Bob Dole both told the Senate Reagan's decision was long
  overdue and urged Japan to open its markets to U.S. goods and
  stop dumping on world markets.
      Each noted in separate speeches that they saw no trade war
  over the issue, despite concerns in financial markets.
      "That fear has no basis in fact," Byrd said.
