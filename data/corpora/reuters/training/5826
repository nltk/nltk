SOUTHEAST CHINA CROPS SAVED BY HEAVY RAIN
  The heaviest rains for seven months are
  believed to have saved more than one mln hectares of
  drought-threatened crops in southeast China, the official New
  China News Agency said.
      This week's rains have alleviated drought conditions in
  Guangdong Province, the agency said.
      China has warned that this year's harvest will be affected
  by drought in many areas.
