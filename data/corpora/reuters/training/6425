COASTAL &lt;CGP> SAYS TRANSAMERICAN SUIT FRIVOLOUS
  Coastal Corp said it belives the two
  billion dlr suit against it by &lt;TransAmerican Natural Gas Corp>
  in Texas state court is frivolous and without merit.
      The company said it intends toi proceed with filing a
  reorganization plan for TransAmerican with the U.S. Bankruptcy
  Court in Houston.
      Yesterday afternoon, the bankruptcy court issued a
  temporary restraining order prohibiting TransAmerican and
  Coastal from taking any action in any court that would
  interfere with the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court.
      Yesterday's bankruptcy court ruling affirmed Coastal's
  rights as a TransAmerican creditor to file a reorganization
  plan for TransAmerican.
      TransAmerican's suit alleges that Coastla attempted to
  unlawfully gain control of TransAmerican's Texas natural gas
  reserves and pipeline system.
      TransAmerican's bankruptcy proceedings began in 1983.
