TRADERS DETAIL FRENCH CEREAL EXPORT REQUESTS
  French operators last Friday requested
  licences to export 10,500 tonnes of free market maize, 11,950
  tonnes of free market barley and 13,000 of soft wheat flour to
  non-EC countries, at prefixed daily (droit commun) rebates,
  French trade sources said.
      The latest requests for the maize were for export to
  Switzerland, Austria and Lichtenstein at a maximum daily rebate
  prefixed last Friday at 141 Ecus a tonne against a previous 20
  Ecu daily rebate.
      The special daily rebate for maize was set in the context
  of a Commission commitment to grant this season rebates for the
  export of 500,000 tonnes of French maize to non-EC countries,
  in compensation for concessions to the U.S. in the recent
  dispute over grain sales to Spain.
      If the latest French requests are accepted as expected,
  this will bring the total of French maize exported in this
  context to 25,500 tonnes.
      The Commission last Thursday granted weekly rebates for the
  sale of 15,000 tonnes of free market maize to non-EC countries.
      Requests for barley were for export to Switzerland, Austria
  and Lichtenstein, Ceuta and Melilla at an unchanged pre-fixed
  restitution of 125 Ecus a tonne, while requests for soft wheat
  flour were for export to various non-EC countries at an
  unchanged 178 Ecus a tonne.
