BELGIAN MONEY SUPPLY RISES IN FOURTH QUARTER 1986
  Belgian total money stock rose to
  1,140.4 billion francs at the end of 1986 from 1,115.4 billion
  at the end of the third quarter of last year and 1,055.0
  billion at the end of 1985, Belgian National Bank figures
  showed.
      Paper money rose to 404.1 billion francs from 394.1 billion
  and 383.5 billion respectively, other forms of privately held
  money to 679.5 billion from 652.7 billion and 616.0 billion.
      Money held by the public authorities fell to 56.8 billion
  francs from 68.6 billion at the end of the previous quarter but
  was above the 55.5 billion at the end of 1985, the bank said.
      The government does not set money supply targets, arguing
  they are inappropriate to a small economy with major trading
  and monetary links with much larger trading countries.
