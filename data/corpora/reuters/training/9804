FIRST INTERSTATE &lt;I> ESTIMATES LOSS ON BRAZIL
  First Interstate Bancorp Chairman
  Joseph Pinola said the bank holding company would lose about 16
  mln dlrs per year, after taxes, if it had to put its medium and
  long-term debt on non-accrual status.
      In an interview, he said that could result in about a 4.5
  pct decline in annual earnings per share.
      Pinola said First Interstate, like other banks, has not yet
  decided to put the loans, which Brazil stopped paying interest
  on last month, on non-accrual status.
      "None of us really wants to injure negotiations that might
  be going on," he said.
      First Interstate reported to the Securities and Exchange
  Commission last week that it has about 339 mln dlrs in
  medium-to long-term loans to Brazil.
      It said on December 31, 1986 its nonperformind Brazilian
  outstanding debt totaled about 4.1 mln dlrs.
      First Interstate also has about 168 mln dlrs in short-term
  loans or trade lines to Brazil.
      Pinola said he believes the solution to the Brazilian debt
  crisis will be more political than economic, which he said he
  finds, "very disquieting and discomforting."
