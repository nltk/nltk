NORMAL WORK RESUMES AT NEW ZEALAND PORTS
  Normal work has resumed at New
  Zealand ports as negotiations between harbour board workers and
  employers continue.
      Wellington Harbour Board Workers' Union secretary Ross
  Wilson told reporters talks late yesterday ended with agreement
  to take unresolved issues before an industrial conciliator.
      Wilson said the only remaining issue is the length of the
  union award. The dispute originally was about wage rates and
  the form of industry negotiations.
      Cook Strait ferry sailings resumed after Marlborough
  Harbour Board workers returned to work this morning, ending
  their industrial action a day early.
      The Waterside Workers' Federation, which struck for most of
  last week and held more than one mln tonnes of shipping in
  ports, meets on Monday and Tuesday in conciliation with the
  Waterfront Employers' Association.
      Union Secretary Sam Jennings said: "We've got two days of
  talks. If it's not all cleaned up by then ... I don't know what
  will happen."
