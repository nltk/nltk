BANK OF JAPAN STEPS UP DOLLAR BUYING
  The Bank of Japan stepped up its dollar
  buying as it re-entered the market after the midday Tokyo lunch
  break, dealers said.
      They said the bank seemed more determined to support the
  dollar than it did this morning.
      Several dealers said the central bank intervened this
  afternoon when the dollar stood around 149 yen.
      One said it purchased 150 to 200 mln dlrs in the half-hour
  since the market re-opened after its lunchtime closure. Another
  said the bank still has buying orders in the market.
