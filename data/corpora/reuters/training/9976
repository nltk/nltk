FOREIGN FIRMS HOPE TO JOIN JAPAN TELECOM COMPANY
  President Nobuo Ito of International
  Telecom Japan Inc (ITJ), one of two rival firms seeking to
  enter Japan's international telecommunications market, said it
  will offer a stake in the company to 10 foreign firms.
        But he declined to specify what share the firms would
  take, and told Reuters they would not participate in its
  management.
      ITJ and International Digital Communications Planning Inc
  (IDC), in which both Cable and Wireless Plc and Pacific Telesis
  Group own 20 pct stakes, are set to merge into a new entity to
  compete against Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd.
