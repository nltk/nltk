CANADA DECEMBER LEADING INDICATOR UP 0.4 PCT
  Canada's leading composite indicator
  advanced 0.4 pct in December after gaining 0.4 pct in the two
  previous months, Statistics Canada said.
      The unfiltered index rose 0.8 pct in the month, a
  turnaround from the 0.3 pct decline in November, the federal
  agency said.
      The manufacturing groups continued to post advances while
  goods production rose 1.6 pct, the third increase in the last
  four months. The advances, however, were offset by a
  deceleration in household demand.
