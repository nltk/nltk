PITT-DES MOINES &lt;PDM> GETS QUALIFIED AUDIT
  Pitt-Des Moines Inc said it will
  receive a qualified opinion from auditors on its 1986 and 1985
  financial statements.
      It said the qualification related to its inability to
  determine the effects, if any, of the final resolution of a
  suit filed against it by &lt;Washington Public Power Supply
  System>.  The 1985 suit was dismissed in a 1986 lower court
  action, but the ultimate outcome of the matter is still
  uncertain since Washington Public Power has appealed to the
  U.S. Court of Appeals.
