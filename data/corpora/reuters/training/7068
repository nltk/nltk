WASTE MANAGEMENT&lt;WMX> TO RAISE CHEMLAWN&lt;CHEM>BID
  Waste Management Inc said it
  sent a letter to the ChemLawn Corp board, saying it is prepared
  to increase its bid for ChemLawn to 33 dlrs a share,
  from 27 dlrs, if ChemLawn promptly negotiates and executes a
  simple two-step merger agreement containing only essential
  covenants and conditions.
      Upon such an agreement, Waste Management said, it would
  amend its 27 dlrs a share cash tender offer.
