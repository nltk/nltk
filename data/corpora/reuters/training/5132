 U.S. SAYS CANADA COMPLYING WITH LUMBER PACT
  The Commerce Department said all
  Canadian firms have begun to pay an agreed 15 pct surcharge on
  softwood shipped to U.S. markets.
      It made the statement after talks with Canadian officials
  about rumors in Canada that some exporters were not paying the
  charge.
      Canada and the U.S. agreed last December to the 15 pct
  charge, ending a lengthy trade dispute over alleged Canadian
  subsidies to Canada's softwood exporters.
      Commerce officials declined to say if any Canadian
  companies had been evading the charge, but said following the
  talks they were convinced all exporters were complying with the
  agreement.
      Undersecretary of Commerce Bruce Smart said "We are
  gratified to learn that companies in Canada have begun paying
  the export charge on lumber."
      He added the agreement was important to the health of the
  U.S. lumber industry and he intended to see that it was fully
  carried out.
