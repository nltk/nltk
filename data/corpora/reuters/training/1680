GATT SETS UP DISPUTE PANEL ON CANADIAN HERRING
  The ruling GATT Council set up a formal
  dispute panel to examine a U.S. Complaint that a Canadian law
  prohibiting export of unprocessed herring and salmon was
  discriminatory.
      David Wood, official spokesman of the General Agreement on
  Tariffs and Trade (GATT), told a news briefing the decision was
  taken after bilateral consultations failed to resolve the row.
      U.S. Ambassador Michael Samuels charged during the Council
  debate that Canada was trying to preserve domestic jobs by
  insisting that herring and salmon be processed at home.
      Robert White, Canada's deputy chief of delegation, replied
  the law was in line with GATT rules, and was for conservations
  reasons. But he agreed to setting up the dispute panel.
