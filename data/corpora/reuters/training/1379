KANEB ENERGY &lt;KEP> MAY OMIT FUTURE PAYOUTS
  Kaneb Energy Partners Ltd said it may be
  forced to omit or lower future quarterly cash distributions
  because of a contract dispute with two major customers and the
  continued slump in oil and gas prices.
      The partnership said, however, that it will pay a regular
  quarterly distribution of 60 cts a unit on April 15 to holders
  of record March 31.
