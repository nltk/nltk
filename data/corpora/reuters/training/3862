PERU GUERRILLAS INTERRUPT TRAIN ROUTE TO MINES
  Maoist guerrillas using dynamite derailed
  two locomotives and four train wagons, interrupting traffic on
  Peru's sole railway line linking the capital to the central
  Andes, where most of the country's mining centres are located,
  authorities said.
      Damages was estimated at 800,000 dlrs in the dynamite blast
  yesterday at Chacapalca, where the explosion wrecked the train
  laden with minerals and 45 metres of the railway line.
      Crews hoped to restore traffic to the line later today
  after clearing the damaged train and repairing the tracks at
  Chacapalca, 225 km east of the Capital, Lima.
      An official at Mineroperu comercial (Minpeco), Peru's state
  minerals marketing firm, said the agency was assessing the
  situation. There had not been a declaration of force majeure on
  contracts to ship minerals abroad.
      Foreign sales of silver, copper, zinc and other minerals
  earn Peru over half of its export income. Most of the minerals,
  extracted and refined in the central peruvian andes, are
  shipped down the central railway to the lima port of callao.
