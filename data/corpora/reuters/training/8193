GOOD DEMAND FOR COLOMBIANS ON BREMEN MARKET
  The Bremen green coffee market attracted
  good buying interest for Colombian coffee last week, while
  Brazils were almost neglected, trade sources said.
      Buyers were awaiting the opening of Brazil's export
  registrations for May shipment, which could affect prices for
  similar qualities, they said.
      Colombia opened export registrations and good business
  developed with both the FNC and private shippers. Prices were
  said to have been very attractive, but details were not
  immediately available.
      Central Americans were sought for spot and afloat.
      In the robusta sector nearby material was rather scarce,
  with turnover limited, the sources said.
      The following offers were in the market at the end of last
  week, first or second hand, sellers' ideas for spot, afloat or
  prompt shipment in dlrs per 50 kilos fob equivalent, unless
  stated (previous week's prices in brackets) -
