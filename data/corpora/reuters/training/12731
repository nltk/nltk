ANZ BANK TO CUT AUSTRALIAN PRIME RATE TO 18 PCT
  Australia and New Zealand Banking
  Group Ltd &lt;ANZA.S> said it will lower its Australian prime
  lending rate to 18 pct from 18.25, effective April 6.
      The cut is the second announced by the bank in the last
  week, following a cut from 18.5 pct effective last Monday.
      The ANZ's new rate will be the lowest prime set by the four
  major trading banks and matches the rate set by one of the
  smaller foreign banks in January and left unchanged during the
  rise in primes over the last three months.
      Other primes range from 18.25 to 18.5 pct, including those
  of the other three majors.
