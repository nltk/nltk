KEATING REVISES DOWN AUSTRALIAN GROWTH FORECAST
  Treasurer Paul Keating forecast
  economic growth at slightly under two pct in the financial year
  ending June this year, down from the 2.25 pct forecast
  contained in the 1986/87 budget delivered last August.
      Australia's terms of trade also fell, by 18 pct, over the
  past two years, he told Parliament. Terms of trade are the
  difference between import and export price indexes.
      Despite the figures, the budget forecast of about 1.75 pct
  annual growth in employment would be met, Keating said.
      Unemployment is currently at 8.2 pct of the workforce.
      "This government is dragging Australia through a trading
  holocaust the kind of which we have not seen since the Second
  World War," Keating said.
      "We are not pushing this place into a recession. We are not
  only holding our gains on unemployment, we are bringing
  unemployment down," he said, adding that the government had help
  the country avoid recession.
