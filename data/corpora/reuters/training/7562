U.K. MONEY MARKET OFFERED EARLY ASSISTANCE
  The Bank of England said it had invited
  an early round of bill offers from the discount houses after
  forecasting a shortage of around 950 mln stg in the money
  market today.
      Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing
  in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain
  around 572 mln stg while a rise in note circulation wil take
  out some 280 mlns stg.
      In addition, exchequer transactions and bankers' balances
  below target will remove some 85 mln stg and 15 mln stg for the
  system respectively.
