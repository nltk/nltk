CHINA'S RAPESEED CROP DAMAGED BY STORMS
  The yield on 46,000 hectares (ha) of
  rapeseed in central China will be cut by up to 70 pct by
  hailstorms and tornadoes that swept across nearly 100,000 ha of
  crops on March 6, the New China News Agency said today.
      The storm, which lashed the Huai and Yangtze rivers and
  eastern Anhui province, left two people dead and 800 others
  injured. Some 800 houses were flattened and 19 boats sunk, it
  said.
      The Anhui provincial government has sent emergency relief
  to the 19 counties affected, the news agency said.
