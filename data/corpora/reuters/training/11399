LYNG HAS NO COMMENT ON WHEAT SUBSIDY TO SOVIETS
  U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
  Lyng declined to confirm statements made today by a farm state
  congressman that the United States will offer subsidized wheat
  to the Soviet Union within the next 10 days to two weeks.
      When asked to clarify comments by Rep. Pat Roberts of
  Kansas that the administration would soon offer Export
  Enhancement wheat to the Soviet Union Lyng said, "well it won't
  be today," and then added, "we have no official comment one way
  or the other."
      Lyng would not comment on whether a wheat subsidy offer to
  the USSR is under more active consideration at the USDA, saying
  that any remarks by him would be tantamount to an official
  announcement and could be construed inappropriately.
