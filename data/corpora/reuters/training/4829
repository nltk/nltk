FRANCE REPAYS SOME OF CURRENCY INTERVENTION DEBT
  France today repaid 21.95 billion francs
  of short-term currency intervention debt to the European
  Monetary Cooperation Fund, EMCF, the Finance Ministry said.
      It said the debt was part of a 33.90 billion franc
  liability incurred through the activation of EMCF swap
  facilities to defend the franc before the January 11 European
  Monetary System realignment.
      The realignment, following several weeks of speculative
  pressure, produced a three pct revaluation of the West German
  mark and the Dutch guilder against the French franc and a two
  pct revaluation of the Belgian franc.
