  Mitsubishi Corp &lt;MITT.TOK> said it has
  taken a 25 pct stake worth five mln krone in &lt;Danish Dairy
  Farms Ltd> and will jointly market its produce from April.

  livestock cooperative federations to expand markets for their
  dairy products, a Mitsubishi official said.

  non-Japanese dairy products in the world market, he said.
