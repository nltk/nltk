HARPER/ROW &lt;HPR> GETS EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST
  Harper and Row Publishers Inc said its
  special committee of independent directors has received
  expressions of interest from a considerable number of domestic
  and foreign firms with respect to restructuring or acquisition
  transactions with the company.
      Winthrop Knowlton, chairman of special committee said "no
  determination has been made by the full board as to any
  transaction."
      He said the special committee and Kidder Peabody and Co Inc
  intend to engage in discussions with interested parties in an
  effort to come to a conclusion in the near future.
      Formation of the special committee was announced early last
  week when Harper and Row said its board had taken no action on
  two pending acquisition proposals.
      At that time, directors also indefinately postponed a
  planned special shareholders vote on a restructuring proposal
  which would have created a Class B common with 10 votes a share
  and limited transferability.
      The acquisition proposals had come from Theodore L. Cross,
  owner of about six pct of the company's stock who offered 34
  dlrs a share, and Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc &lt;HBJ>, which
  offered 50 dlrs a share.
