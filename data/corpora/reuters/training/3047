BOSPHORUS SHIPPING MOVES, ISTANBUL OFFICES CLOSE
  Istanbul remained at a virtual
  standstill today under snow up to a meter deep but shipping was
  moving through the narrow Bosphorus waterway linking the Sea of
  Marmara and the Black Sea, officials said.
      The authorities ordered government offices closed until
  Wednesday. Many banks, businesses and schools stayed shut as
  workers struggled to keep main roads and supply lines open in
  this city of 6.5 mln people.
      The second blizzard to hit Istanbul in a week stopped
  yesterday afternoon and the international airport reopened
  today after a two-day closure. It was also shut earlier last
  week.
