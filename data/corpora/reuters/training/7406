LATIN COFFEE PRODUCERS SEEK ICO PRICE SUPPORT
  This weekend's meeting of Latin
  American coffee producers here will call for the International
  Coffee Organisation (ICO) to start talks aimed at firming
  prices, Nicaraguan foreign trade minister Alejandro Martinez
  Cuenca said.
      He said those countries which had confirmed their presence
  were Brazil, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica and
  Panama. Colombia had been invited but he did not know if it
  would attend.
      Martinez Cuenca told reporters central america alone had
  lost some 700 mln dlrs through the weakness of world coffee
  prices, partially caused by lack of an ICO quota agreement.
