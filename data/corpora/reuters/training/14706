SOUTHERN TEXAS GRAIN DIFFERENTIALS ADJUSTED
  Posted county prices in 99 southern
  Texas counties have been changed to reflect only one market
  differential instead of the usual two-terminal market pricing
  system, a senior Agriculture Department official said.
      Interior grain and soybean prices in the affected counties
  will now be based solely against the Texas Gulf. Prior to the
  change, county prices were also priced against the Amarillo
  market.
      The changes were made to better reflect local market
  conditions, said Ralph Klopfenstein, deputy administrator for
  commodity operations at USDA.
      "The Texas Gulf has always been the dominant market in those
  counties. Amarillo never became effective for that area,"
  Klopfenstein told Reuters.
