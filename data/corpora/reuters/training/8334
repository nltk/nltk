MOTO PHOTO &lt;MOTO> SEES BETTER 1ST QUARTER 1987
  Moto Photo Inc  president, Michael
  Adler, said he expects the company's first quarter earnings for
  fiscal 1987 to be better than the same quarter a year ago.
      Adler said, however, that the quarter would still be a
  loss, primarily because it is the low season for the imaging
  business.
      Photo Moto recored a net loss for the first quarter 1986
  ending March 31 of 328,889 dlrs.
