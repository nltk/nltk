FED MAY SUPPLY RESERVES IN THE MONEY MARKETS
  There is a slightly better than even
  chance that the Federal Reserve will enter the U.S. Government
  securities market to add temporary reserves, economists said.
      They said the Fed would supply the reserves indirectly via
  around 1.5 billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements.
      Federal funds, which averaged 6.25 pct yesterday, opened at
  6-1/16 pct and moved in a narrow range between there and six
  pct in early trading.
