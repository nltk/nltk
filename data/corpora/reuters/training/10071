DENNISON MANUFACTURING &lt;DSN> TO SELL PAPER UNIT
  Dennison Manufacturing Co
  said it has signed a letter of intent to sell its Dunn Paper Co
  subsidiary to James River Corp &lt;JR> for an undisclosed amount
  of cash, resulting in a first quarter charge against earnings.
      The company saiud the loss on the sale may be partly
  reduced by contingent payments over the next five years and
  will in the first quarter be more than offset by the gain from
  the previously-announced sale of its Hygeia Sciences Inc
  shares.
      Dunn had sales last year of about 65 mln dlrs.
      In Richmond, Va., James River said closing is expected by
  the end of April, subject to approval by both boards and on the
  reaching of satisfactory labor agreements.
