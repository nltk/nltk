PERU ANNOUNCES LARGE NEW GOLD FIND
  President Alan Garcia said Peru has found
  gold deposits worth an estimated 1.3 billion dlrs in a jungle
  region near the Ecuadorean border about 1,000 km north of here.
      He told reporters yesterday the deposits, located at four
  sites near the town of San Ignasio, contained the equivalent of
  100 tonnes of gold.
      Garcia said the government would soon install a two mln dlr
  treatment plant at Tomaque. It will extract enough ore to
  provide an estimated 25 mln dlr profit by the end of this year,
  he added.
      Garcia said the other gold-bearing deposits are located at
  Tamborapa, Pachapidiana, and a zone between the Cenepa and
  Santiago rivers.
