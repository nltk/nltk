CANADA-EGYPT WHEAT NEGOTIATIONS TO CONTINUE
  Canadian and Egyptian wheat negotiators
  failed to conclude an agreement on Canadian wheat exports to
  Egypt during talks last week, but the Canadian team will return
  to Cairo for further negotiations, Canadian embassy officials
  said.
      An embassy official declined to identify which issues
  remained to be resolved and when the talks would resume.
      In a five-year protocol signed in 1985, Cairo agreed to
  purchase 500,000 tonnes of Canadian wheat a year.
