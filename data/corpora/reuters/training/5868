BILLITON SEEKS CHANGE IN SURINAM POLICIES
  &lt;Billiton
  International Metals B.V.>, the Dutch mining company, has urged
  Surinam to change policies it says are causing heavy losses on
  bauxite mining operations there, a company spokesman said.
      He told Reuters that Billiton, a fully-owned Royal
  Dutch/Shell &lt;RD.AS> subsidiary, presented the demands to Henk
  Heidweiler, a top aide to Surinam military leader Desi
  Bouterse, who visited the Netherlands last week for official
  talks.
      Billiton and &lt;Suralco>, owned by U.S. Conglomerate Alcoa
  &lt;AA.S>, both want devaluation, and lower wages, welfare
  contributions, taxes on bauxite and energy prices.
      The two firms are the biggest private sector employers in
  Surinam. Billiton also urged Heidweiler to improve the safety
  of its employees in the campaign against a jungle guerilla
  group, the spokesman said, adding rebel fighting since July
  1986 had depressed production at Billiton and Suralco plants.
      High voltage cables from the power plant of Afobakka have
  been cut, and a bauxite mine at Moengo has been shut, he added.
      "We are already making vast losses in Surinam and you can't
  expect any company to remain operating with losses," the
  spokesman said.
