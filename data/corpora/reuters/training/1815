CHINA SUGAR OUTPUT SEEN LOWER -- USDA
  China's 1986/87 sugar crop has been
  revised to 5.26 mln tonnes (raw value), down four pct from the
  previous forecast and five pct below the previous season, the
  U.S. Agriculture Department said.
      In its World Production and Trade Report, the department
  attributed the decline to relatively poor profitability of
  sugar, causing harvested area of cane and beets to decline
  seven pct from 1985/86.
      Beet sugar production for 1986/87 is now estimated at
  837,000 tonnes, five pct less than earlier forecast and down
  five pct from the previous season, while cane output is
  projected at 4.423 mln tonnes, down four pct from previously
  forecast and five pct below the previous season, it said.
