U.K. INTERVENTION BOARD DETAILS EC SUGAR SALES
  A total 59,000 tonnes of current series
  white sugar received export rebates of a maximum 45.678
  European Currency Units (Ecus) per 100 kilos at today's
  European Community (EC) tender, the U.K. Intervention Board
  said.
      Out of this, traders in West Germany received 34,750
  tonnes, in the U.K. 13,000, in Denmark 7,250 and in France
  4,000 tonnes, it added.
      Earlier today, London traders had expected the subsidy for
  the current season whites campaign for licences to end-Aug to
  be more than 45.00 Ecus per 100 kilos but Paris traders were
  more precise by forecasting a rebate level of 45.75 to 46.0
  Ecus.
      London traders were also reluctant earlier to predict the
  likely tonnage to be authorised for export in view of the
  on-going dispute between the Commission and European producers
  over the threatened action by the producers to move over
  800,000 tonnes to intervention.
      Last week saw 60,500 tonnes whites athuorised for export at
  a maximum rebate of 44.819 Ecus per 100 kilos.
