ALLIED-LYONS SEES HIRAM WALKER PROFITS RISING
  &lt;Allied-Lyons PLC> sees rising profits
  from 51-pct-owned liquor producer Hiram Walker-Gooderham and
  Worts in the current fiscal year ending in early March, 1988,
  chairman Derrick Holden-Brown said in a speech prepared for
  delivery to Toronto analysts.
      "We anticipate that Hiram Walker profits will be well above
  those of the plateau years," he said, referring to the four
  years up to 1985.
      "In other words, we will have regained the 1985 position
  and improved on it," Holden-Brown said.
      Allied-Lyons won control of Hiram Walker-Gooderham last
  year in a battle against Gulf Canada Corp, which finally got a
  49 pct stake after an out-of-court settlement.
      Hiram Walker Resources Ltd, the previous owner, reported
  liquor profits of 282 mln Canadian dlrs in the fiscal year
  ending Sept. 30, 1985, 278 mln dlrs in 1984, 267 mln in 1983,
  294 mln in 1982 and 280 mln in 1981.
      Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons' financial results for the
  fiscal year just ended March seven would include three months
  of Hiram Walker-Gooderham profits, but he did not provide
  actual figures.
      He said Hiram Walker-Gooderham's profit improvement in the
  current year will come from a previously announced
  reorganization put into effect March 1, 1987 and a close
  partnership with Allied-Lyons' existing Allied Vintners
  division.
