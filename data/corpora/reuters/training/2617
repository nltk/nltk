CANADA UPHOLDS COUNTERVAIL DUTY ON U.S. CORN
  The Canadian Import Tribunal ruled today
  subsidized U.S. corn imports were injurious to Canadian growers
  and upheld a countervailing duty of 84.9 U.S. cts a bushel set
  earlier this year.
      The ruling is the result of trade action launched in 1985
  by the Ontario Corn Producers Association that contended U.S.
  subsidies were driving American corn prices below Canadian
  production costs.
      A spokesman for the Department of Revenue said a study of
  the level of the duty will be undertaken in the next six months
  to determine if it should be adjusted.
