NATIONAL SEMICONDUCTOR&lt;NSM> CITES IMPROVED RESULTS
  National Semiconductor Corp
  said improved results at its Semiconductor Group helped reduce
  losses in the third quarter and nine months.
      In the quarter ended March 8, the group had a modest sales
  increase and major improvement in operating performance
  compared to the year-ago quarter, the company said.
      But results softened from the prior quarter because of low
  bookings last fall for third quarter shipment and holiday
  shutdowns, it said.
      The semiconductor maker cut net losses to 25.6 mln dlrs or
  31 cts a share from 39.4 mln dlrs or 47 cts in the quarter.
      Losses in the nine months were reduced to 32.7 mln dlrs or
  44 cts from 84.4 mln dlrs or one dlr. Sales grew 23.5 pct in
  the quarter to 398.1 mln dlrs and 25.5 pct in the nine months
  to 1.36 billion dlrs.
      Bookings recovered in the latter part of the third quarter,
  the company said. Despite the improvement in order rates and
  operating results year-to-year, pricing continues to be
  "aggressive for many products," it said.
      Nevertheless, it expects the semiconductor business will
  continue to improve this year. The Information Systems Group
  will continue strong sales growth based on recent order trends
  and new product introductions, it said.
