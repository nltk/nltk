GERMAN FEBRUARY CENTRAL BANK MONEY GROWTH STEADY
  West German central bank money stock
  was growing at an annualized 7.5 pct in February, unchanged
  from the 7.5 pct reported in January, provisional data from the
  Bundesbank showed.
      The figure was thus outside the three to six pct range set
  by the Bundesbank for 1987.
      In absolute terms, the measure rose to 223.2 billion marks
  in February from 221.8 billion in the prior month.
      The data showed that the stock grew at an annualized 8.6
  pct over the six months to February, slower than the 9.4 pct
  rise in the same period to January.
      Of the two components comprising central bank money stock,
  cash in circulation rose to 111.7 billion marks in February
  from 110.9 billion in January, the Bundesbank data showed.
      This gave an annualized 8.3 pct rise over the six months to
  February, down from a 10.2 pct increase over the six months to
  January.
      Minimum reserve requirements on domestic liabilities grew
  to 111.5 billion marks in February from 110.9 billion in
  January.
      This yielded an annualized 8.8 pct rise over the six month
  to February, up slightly from an 8.6 pct increase over the same
  period to January.
