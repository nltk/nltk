FOOTHILL GROUP &lt;FGI> SEES BETTER FIRST QUARTER
  Don Gevirtz, chairman of The Foothill
  Group Inc, told Reuters the company's first quarter results
  will be up sharply over last year's eight cents a share.
      "First quarter results will be dramatically better," he
  said following a presentation to analysts. He cited a sharp
  drop in non-earning assets, healthy asset growth and lower
  expenses.
      He declined to predict specific results for the first
  quarter. In the 1986 first quarter, the commerical finance
  company earned 606,000 dlrs, or eight cts per share.
      Gevirtz also declined to predict full year results, but
  said, "We expect an excellent year." In 1986 Foothill earned
  3,239,000 dlrs, or 41 cts per share.
      Analysts expect Foothill to record earnings of 65 cts to 85
  cts a share in 1987.
      During the presentation Gevirtz said Foothill has reduced
  to less than five pct the company's level of non-performing
  assets, which was as high as eight pct in previous years.
      David Hilton, chief financial officer, said the company's
  general and administrative expenses in 1987 will be reduced to
  about 3.0 to 3.5 pct of average assets from 4.3 pct in 1986.
      The company had average assets of 399.8 mln dlrs from
  continuing operations and 29.8 mln dlrs from discontinued
  operations in 1986, according to its annual report.
