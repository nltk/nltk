VOLCKER CALLS DOLLAR SLIDE ENOUGH
  Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul
  Volcker said that the dollar's slide in currency markets has
  been enough, a Fed spokesman said.
      The spokesman confirmed that Volcker, who spoke to a group
  of financial analysts, said in answer to a question about the
  dollar's recent slide that "enough is enough."
      Volcker has often expressed concern about the dollar
  falling too rapidly in currency markets.
