GATT SUCCESS WILL TAKE PRESSURE, N.Z. MINISTER
  Long term pressure by trade
  ministers is necessary if the current Uruguay round of talks on
  the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) is to
  succeed, New Zealand's Overseas Trade minister Mike Moore said.
      Moore told the opening meeting of trade ministers from 22
  nations gathered for informal talks on the GATT that ministers
  "need opportunities to keep in touch and to consider how the
  political problems inherent in an exercise like this one can be
  faced and resolved."
      Moore said the Taupo meeting is one of a series of such
  international gatherings, which includes the OECD ministerial
  meeting in May and the G-7 meeting in Venice in June, enabling
  ministers to maintain contact.
      World trade conditions are getting better not worse, he
  said.
      He said New Zealand is "moving rapidly and of our own
  initiative in the direction of liberalisation, and I warn you
  we shall be looking for partners."
