  Auditors for Public Service
  Co of Indiana Inc lifted a qualification, in effect for two
  years, on its 1986 financial results, according to the
  company's annual shareholders' report.
      PSI's report was qualified in 1984 and 1985 when its
  auditors, Arthur Andersen and Co, questioned the utility's
  ability to recover costs of its Marble Hill nuclear power plant
  and to extend the maturity of its credit agreement.
      The company wrote off 141 mln dlrs of Marble Hill costs in
  November, 1986 and repaid its final 20 mln dlrs in debt in
  October, 1986, it said.
