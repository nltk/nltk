INDONESIAN SUGAR OUTPUT FORECAST TO RISE IN 1987
  Indonesian sugar output is forecast by
  the government to reach 2.126 mln tonnes in calendar 1987
  against projected consumption of 2.039 mln tonnes, Agriculture
  Minister Achmad Affandi said.
      Production in 1986, when Indonesia was forced to import
  sugar, is officially estimated at 2.016 mln tonnes against
  1.728 mln in 1985.
      The U.S. Embassy said in its annual Agriculture Report on
  Indonesia there were growing signs that actual output was lower
  than official figures. It estimated 1986 production at 1.8 mln
  tonnes and forecast little change for 1987.
      Indonesia imported 162,000 tonnes of sugar towards the end
  of last year and in early 1987 to boost low stocks.
      Affandi told reporters stocks fel to as low as 159,000
  tonnes at the beginning of 1987. Industry sources said this
  represented under one month's consumption.
      The minister said Indonesia should hold three months'
  supply, or 510,000 tonnes.
      A spokesman for the National Logistics Bureau, which
  distributes and stores sugar, said stocks this month were
  489,437 tonnes. The harvesting season begins in April.
