EDELMAN GROUP IN PLAN TO BUY MORSE SHOE &lt;MRS>
  A group led by New York investor
  Asher Edelman said Morse Shoe Inc agreed to provide it
  confidential company information and that his group would make
  an offer to buy Morse only in a friendly, negotiated deal.
      The group also said in a filing with the Securities and
  Exchange Commission that its members would not, without Morse
  approval, buy or offer to buy any company securities giving the
  group a 10 pct or more stake in the company.
      Edelman and his group said his terms held until the earlier
  of 90 days from March 3 or the date on which Morse announces a
  definite agreement for its sale.
      At the same time, the Edelman group said it cut its stake
  in Morse to 8.4 pct from 9.7 pct.
