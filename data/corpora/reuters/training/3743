DUPONT &lt;DD> UP ON RECOMMENDATIONS
  Shares of Du Pont Co rose today after
  accumulating recommendations from Shearson Lehman Brothers and
  First Boston, traders said.
      Du Pont, which opened with a two point gain, stood at
  109-1/8, up 1-1/8.
      First Boston's analyst was not available for comment.
      Analyst Theodore Semegran of Shearson said he raised his
  earnings estimates for the company to 7.25 dlrs a share in 1987
  and eight dlrs a share in 1988. The company earned 6.35 dlrs a
  share in 1986.
      "Good domestic demand, higher operating earnings and a
  strng export business, probably benefitting from a lower dollar
  and effects of reduced imports in chemicals will continue to
  aid Du Pont." He also noted that energy earnings in the first
  quarter are better than expected because of the rise in crude
  prices. Semegran expects first quarter earnings
  of about 1.85 dlrs a share from 1.67 dlrs last year.
      He also expects the company to raise its annual dividend
  about 20 to 30 cts a share, from its current dividend of 3.20
  dlrs a share, "and a stock split is possible but it has a low
  probablility."
