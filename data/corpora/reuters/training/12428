U.K. GRAIN EXPORTS CONTINUE TO RISE SHARPLY
  The U.K. Exported 517,600 tonnes of wheat
  and 315,800 tonnes of barley in the first 25 days of March, the
  Home Grown Cereals Authority (HGCA) said, quoting provisional
  Customs and Excise figures.
      This brought combined wheat and barley exports since the
  season started on July 1 to 7.60 mln tonnes, substantially up
  on the 4.02 mln exported in the same 1985/86 period.
      This season's total comprises 3.94 mln tonnes of wheat and
  3.66 mln barley, compared with 1.63 mln and 2.39 mln,
  respectively, a year ago.
