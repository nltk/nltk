  Banca della Svizzera Italiana &lt;BISZ.Z>
  said it expected business to be good again this year after
  1986's 15.2 pct increase in net profit to 42 mln Swiss francs.
      Chief Executive Giorgio Ghiringhelli told reporters he
  expected almost all important sectors to expand well in 1987.
  An important exception would be its securities business, which
  would grow more slowly.
      Ghiringhelli also said the bank planned to convert its
  representation in London into a subsidiary at the end of this
  year and further expand activities at its New York subsidiary,
  particularly in private banking.
