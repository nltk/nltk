USSR CORN BUYING MAY BE 3.5 MLN TONNES--AMSTUTZ
  The Soviet Union's recent corn
  purchases from the United States could total as much as 3.5 mln
  tonnes, U.S. Agriculture Undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said.
      "We are not sure how much (Soviets have bought) but we think
  it could be as high as 3.5 mln tonnes," Amstutz told a House
  Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee.
      He added that China also will need to import more corn this
  year than earlier anticipated, but he gave no figures.
