MEATPACKERS RESPOND TO OCCIDENTAL&lt;OXY> OFFER
  Local 222 of the United Food and
  Commercial Workers Union said it is calling a membership
  meeting, possibly Sunday, to discuss its response to a decision
  by Iowa Beef Processors Inc to lift a lockout at its Dakota
  City, Nebraska plant and resume operations.
      The UFCWU will consider all options available to it
  including a strike or returning to work under IBP's last labor
  contract proposal, a spokeswoman for Local 222 said by phone.
      About 2,800 UFCWU members have been locked out at the
  Dakota City plant since December 14.
      IBP is a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corp.
