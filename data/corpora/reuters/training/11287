U.S./JAPAN TRADE WAR NOT IN UK'S INTEREST - LAWSON
  U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
  Lawson said the United States and Japan must work to avert a
  possible trade war, and he added that a trade war would not be
  in the interests of Britain.
      Lawson told journalists that "the prospects for the (U.K.)
  economy look very very good - providing we can avoid a trade
  war." He stressed that "a heavy responsiblity in different ways
  lies on Japan and the United States to ensure that we do avoid
  such a trade war."
      Asked whether he believed such a trade war could be
  averted, Lawson replied, "I very much hope so."
      Britain last week warned that it would retaliate if Japan
  did not move soon to open its markets to outside competition.
      Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher gave notice that the U.K.
  Would fight the Japanese government's attempt to prevent (Cable
  and Wireless Plc) (CAWL.L) from taking a significant position
  in a new Japanese international telecommunications venture.
      But British officials are now trying to dampen
  anti-Japanese rhetoric, to try to keep developments under
  control.
      The British Conservative government will on Thursday
  consider what legal options are available to it to try to
  increase U.K. Access to Japanese markets, officials said.
