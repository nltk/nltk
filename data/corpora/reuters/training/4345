ST LAWRENCE SEAWAY TO OPEN ON SCHEDULE
  The St Lawrence Seaway and the Welland
  Canal linking Lakes Erie and Ontario were expected to open as
  scheduled on March 31 and April 1, respectively, a St Lawrence
  Seaway official said.
      The entire Seaway is already free of ice due to the mild
  Winter and could be open for navigation today, "but there
  doesn't seem to be enough demand from shipping companies to
  warrant an early opening," the Canadian official said.
      Repairs are continuing at a stepped up pace on the Welland
  Canal and should be completed by the April 1 start-up date, she
  added.
