TAIWAN MONEY SUPPLY RISES 48.22 PCT IN YEAR
  Taiwan's M-1B money supply rose a
  seasonally adjusted 48.22 pct in the year to end-February,
  after rising 54.96 pct in the year to January, a central bank
  spokesman said.
      Month on month, M1-B fell 5.19 pct from January.
      Unadjusted February M1-B was 1,168 billion dlrs against
  1,232 billion in January and 788 billion in February 1986.
      Money supply grew faster in January because the central
  bank issued more currency for bonus payments made to workers at
  the Lunar New Year, which fell on January 29 this year, banking
  sources said.
