CITICORP &lt;CCI> SEES DOUBLING IN RETAIL BANK NET
  Citicorp expects net income in its
  individual banking sector to top one billion dlrs by 1993,
  compared with 462 mln dlrs in 1986, said Richard Braddock, head
  of Citicorp's individual banking division.
      "We can double our earnings over the next five to seven
  years," he told a banking analysts meeting, adding that this
  forecast may be on the conservative side.
      He said that bank card operations and the New York branch
  system would continue to turn in hefty profits but also picked
  out other developing areas, such as U.S. mortgage and
  international consumer, as major potential earners.
      Braddock and his sector heads made the following more
  specific predictions:
      - Cost of funds and net credit loss levels in the U.S.
  bankcard unit will taper off in coming years from 1986's
  relatively inflated levels.
      - Customer net revenue in the mortgage banking area will
  rise to 464.7 mln dlrs in 1987 from 374.3 mln in 1986.
      - The international consumer business will show 22 pct
  compound annual growth in earnings between 1986 and 1992.
      - Private banking earnings will hit 100 mln dlrs in 1987
  and top 200 mln dlrs in 1992.
