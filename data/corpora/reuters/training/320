INDIA BUYS 46,000 TONNES OF VEGETABLE OILS
  The Indian State Trading Corporation
  purchased 46,000 tonnes of vegetable oils at its import tender
  on Friday, market sources said.
      The business was for April shipments and comprised 20,000
  tonnes of European rapeseed oil at 318 dlrs, 20,000 tonnes of
  soyoil, believed South American origin, at 314, and 6,000
  tonnes of Malaysian rbd palm olein at 347 dlrs, all per tonne
  cif.
      Palm oil sellers were disappointed at the light purchase of
  rbd olein and early trading saw the market ease nearly 10 dlrs
  under Malaysian refiner and dealer selling. April shipments
  traded down to 326 dlrs per tonne, fob.
