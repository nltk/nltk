PERU SHORT-TERM TRADE CREDIT UP TO 430 MLN DLRS
  Peru's short-term foreign trade credit
  lines, regarded as vital to ensure smooth foreign commercial
  transactions, have more than doubled to 430 mln dollars under
  the 20-month government of president Alan Garcia.
      Central bank general manager Hector Neyra told reporters
  many of the credits were 90-day.
      Trade credits were 210 mln dlrs when Garcia took office in
  1985 announcing a tough stance limiting foreign debt repayments
  to 10 pct of export earnings.
      Neyra told Reuters Peru was current on interest payments on
  short-term debt, including trade credit lines and on about 750
  mln dlrs in so-called  "working capital" credits.
      Trade credit lines were 880 mln dlrs in 1982, but fell in
  1984 when Peru stopped some payments to private foreign banks.
