  will ask shareholders at the April 23 annual meeting to approve
  the doubling of authorized common shares to 120 mln.
      Holders will also vote on a proposal to create a new class
  of 25 mln shares of serial preferred stock one dlr par value in
  place of its existing classes of authorized and unissued
  preferred stock.
      It said at its regular March board meeting members will
  consider a stock split or stock dividend, which would be
  contingent upon stockholder approval of the changes in the
  capital structure at the April annual meeting.
      Holders will also be asked to approve a new corporate name,
  Aon Corp. It said aon is a Gaelic word meaning unit. The name
  is intended to eliminate confusion between the parent company

  of directors and amend the provision for indemnifying
  directors, officers employees an agents. This is being done to
