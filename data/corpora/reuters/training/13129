  The U.S. Agriculture Department said
  Turkey has been made eligible for the sale of up to 70,000
  tonnes of medium grain milled rice under the department's
  export enhancement program, EEP.
      As with the 65 previous EEP initiatives, the export sales
  would be subsidized with commodities from the inventory of the
  Commodity Credit Corp and made at competitive world prices,
