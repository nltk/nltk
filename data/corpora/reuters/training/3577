  Johnson and Johnson said the U.S.
  Food and Drug Administration has notified the company its food
  additive petition for a high-intensity sweetener has been
  formally accepted and now will be reviewed by the agency.
      The company said the product, with the generic name of
  sucralose, is made from sugar and tastes like sugar, but is
  about 600 times sweeter.
      It yields no calories and does not promote tooth decay.
