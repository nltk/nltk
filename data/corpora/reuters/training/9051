BRAZIL COMPUTER MARKET TO REMAIN CLOSED-MINISTER
  Brazilian Science and Technology
  Minister Renato Archer said Brazil will keep its computer
  market closed to foreign goods in order to give its own infant
  industry time to develop.
      "Every country establishes laws to protect its interests.
  The United States closed their borders at a certain stage to
  some foreign goods and therefore protected its industrial
  development. Now it is time for Brazil to do likewise," Archer
  said at the opening of a national software conference.
      After several meetings, Brazil and the U.S. Have made no
  major progress in their computer row, which they have been
  trying to resolve for the past 18 months.
      The Reagan administration has objected to Brazil protecting
  its computer industry from imports.
