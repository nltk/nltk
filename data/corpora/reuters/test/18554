U.S. SENATORS PROPOSE BAN ON TOSHIBA IMPORTS
  Three U.S. Senators said they will
  propose a temporary ban on imports of all Toshiba products due
  to the company's illegal sales of sensitive high-technology
  goods to the Soviet Union.
      Senator Jake Garn, John Heinz and Richard Selby said at a
  hearing of the senate banking committee on export control, they
  will offer the proposal as part of a major trade bill when it
  is brought before the senate this summer.
      Garn, a Utah Republican, said "I am talking about specific
  retribution on a company that endangers the security of their
  own country and ours."
