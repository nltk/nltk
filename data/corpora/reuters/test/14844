SUBROTO SAYS INDONESIA SUPPORTS TIN PACT EXTENSION
  Mines and Energy Minister Subroto
  confirmed Indonesian support for an extension of the sixth
  International Tin Agreement (ITA), but said a new pact was not
  necessary.
      Asked by Reuters to clarify his statement on Monday in
  which he said the pact should be allowed to lapse, Subroto said
  Indonesia was ready to back extension of the ITA.
      "We can support extension of the sixth agreement," he said.
  "But a seventh accord we believe to be unnecessary."
      The sixth ITA will expire at the end of June unless a
  two-thirds majority of members vote for an extension.
