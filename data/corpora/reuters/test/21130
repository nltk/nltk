FED'S JOHNSON SEES EASING OF INFLATIONARY FEARS
  Federal Reserve Board Vice-Chairman
  Manuel Johnson said the inflationary expectations in the
  financial markets have eased since the Fed's last half-point
  increase in its discount rate to 6.0 pct.
      "We have seen the kind of expectational forces develop I
  think that we've been satisfied with since our last discount
  rate move," Johnson said.
      Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has said the most recent
  discount rate increase on September 4 was largely aimed at
  quelling inflationary fears in financial markets which he said
  were largely unfounded.
