SPAIN APPEALS FOR EC HELP ON MAIZE IMPORTS
  Spanish farm minister Carlos Romero,
  speaking at a meeting of EC farm ministers, called for action
  to help the Spanish maize market, Spanish diplomatic sources
  said.
      Spain is threatened with massive imports from third
  countries by the end of the year, they said.
      They said the imports are due to come in as a result of the
  accord by which the EC has promised the United States it will
  import two mln tonnes of maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum
  into Spain from third countries this year.
      Around a sixth of this tonnage has so far come in under a
  reduced levy system and the EC cereals management committee may
  decide this week to authorise the Spanish intervention board to
  make direct purchases.
      The sources said Romero urged that other EC countries
  should take some of the imports to prevent disturbance of the
  Spanish market.
      They said he threatened to withhold support for the EC
  Commission plan for new limits on farm output which if breached
  would mean price cuts unless Spain received some help.
      The sources said no direct reply was given to Romero at the
  meeting.
