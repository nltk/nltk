DOE RESOLVES ISSUES WITH ROYAL DUTCH &lt;RD> UNIT
  The Energy Department said it had
  approved in final form an agreement that resolves all remaining
  issues with Shell Oil Co over oil pricing and allocation
  controls that ended in 1981.
      Under the agreement, The Royal Dutch/Shell Group unit 
  agreed to pay 20 mln dlrs to settle refiner pricing issues and
  160 mln dlrs to settle crude oil pricing issues, DOE said.
      DOE said that before making the pact final, it modified it
  to reflect Shell's compliance with the Tertiary Incentive
  Program, a provision not in the version published last Dec 31.
