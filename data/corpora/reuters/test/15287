SOUTH KOREA CORN IMPORTS MAY INCREASE - USDA
  South Korea's purchase of about 2.4
  mln tonnes of U.S. corn in the past six months -- close to
  double last year's total -- indicates that imports from the
  United States, as well as total imports are set for a dramatic
  jump, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
      In its World Production and Trade Report, the department
  said total South Korea corn imports for the 1986/87 season
  (Oct-Sept) are estimated at 4.3 mln tonnes, with about 3.4 mln
  tonnes from the United States.
      During the 1985/86 season, imports totaled only 1.3 mln
  tonnes of U.S. corn out of a total of 3.6 mln tonnes.
      Ite appears the Koreans are shifting back to U.S. corn in
  light of competitive U.S. prices and uncertain supplies from
  China, Argentina and South Africa, it said.
