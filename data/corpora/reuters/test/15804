U.S. CONGRESSMAN INTRODUCES REAGAN SUGAR BILL
  Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., introduced
  in the House of Representatives legislation proposed by the
  Reagan administration to slash the U.S. sugar price support, a
  spokesman for Porter said.
      The spokesman said the bill was introduced without any
  changes from the administration's proposal sent to Congress
  last month.
      That plan calls for a cut in the sugar loan rate to 12
  cents per pound from 18 cents now. Sugar growers would be
  compensated for the price cut with targeted direct payments,
  to be gradually phased-out through 1990. The payments to
  growers would cost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs.
      Representatives of sugar growers have rejected the
  proposal, saying it would ruin the domestic sugar industry.
