TIGHT FAR EAST FREIGHT SPACE HITS SUGAR MARKET
  The Far Eastern sugar market is being hit
  by a tightening in available nearby freight space needed to
  move raw sugar to various destinations, notably from Thailand,
  traders said.
      This has resulted in a hardening of freight rates in those
  areas. These are now being quoted between 12.5 and 17.5 dlrs a
  tonne per day, depending on shipment and destination, against
  recent fixings below 12 dlrs a tonne.
      Charterers are considering combining contracted shipments
  because of inadequate space, shipping sources said, noting 13
  raws cargoes are awaiting shipment from various ports.
      A cargo of Thai raw sugar was reported traded at basis July
  New York futures less 25 points for June/July 15 shipment,
  traders said. But others said this was old business.
