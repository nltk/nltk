SENATE PANEL STUDIES LOAN RATE, SET ASIDE PLANS
  The Senate Agriculture Committee was
  expected to consider proposals that would limit adjustments in
  county loan rate differentials which trigger larger corn and
  wheat acreage reduction requirements, Senate staff said.
      A budget-saving proposal drafted by chairman Patrick Leahy
  (D-Vt) would limit adjustments in county loan rate
  differentials to no more than one pct per year from the
  national average loan rate, starting with 1988 crops.
      The plan also would allow the Agriculture Secretary to
  increase the unpaid acreage reduction requirement for corn by
  "an appropriate amount to generate savings" if projected corn
  stocks exceeded 6.0 billion bushels.
      Leahy's proposal would also allow a larger 1988 wheat set
  aside if projected stocks surpassed 1.9 billion bushels.
