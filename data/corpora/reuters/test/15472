FAO SEES LOWER GLOBAL WHEAT, GRAIN OUTPUT IN 1987
  The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation
  (FAO) said global wheat and coarse grain output was likely to
  fall in 1987 but supplies would remain adequate to meet demand.
      FAO said in its monthly food outlook bulletin total world
  grain output was expected to fall 38 mln tonnes to 1,353 mln in
  1987, due mainly to unusually high winter losses in the Soviet
  Union, drought in China and reduced plantings in North America.
      World cereal stocks at the end of 1986/87 were forecast to
  rise 47 mln tonnes to a record 452 mln tonnes, softening the
  impact of reduced production. But stocks are unevenly
  distributed, with about 50 pct held by the U.S.
      "Thus the food security prospects in 1987/88 for many
  developing countries, particularly in Africa, depend crucially
  on the outcome of this year's harvests," FAO said.
      FAO said world cereal supplies in 1986/87 were estimated at
  a record 2,113 mln tonnes, about five pct higher than last
  season and due mainly to large stocks and a record 1986
  harvest, estimated at 1,865 mln tonnes.
      FAO's forecast of 1986/87 world cereals trade was revised
  upwards by eight mln tonnes to 179 mln due to the likelihood of
  substantial buying by China and the Soviet Union.
