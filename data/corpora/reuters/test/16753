CHINA FACES EXTENDED SORGHUM SHORTAGE
  China will be short of sorghum in 1987
  for the sixth successive year because high production costs and
  low profits discourage farmers from growing it, the China Daily
  Business Weekly said.
      It said sorghum output in calendar 1986 was 5.34 mln
  tonnes, down five pct from the 1985 level, and prices on the
  free market rose in January to 0.42 yuan per kg, up 14 pct on
  January 1986.
      It said sorghum acreage in 1987 is six pct lower than in
  1986. Sorghum accounts for 40 pct of the raw materials needed
  by China's breweries, it added but gave no more details.
