JWT GROUP &lt;JWT> SUES WPP GROUP PLC
  JWT Group Inc said it filed a suit
  against &lt;WPP Group Plc> to enjoin the company from continuing
  its tender offer.
      The company said it charged that former JWT Group unit
  executive John Peters has breached his fiduciary duty by
  disclosing confidential information about the company and its
  clients.
      The company said the suit, filed in New York State Supreme
  Court, seeks to halt the "ongoing misuse and misappropriation
  of highly confidential and proprietary information concerning
  JWT and its clients.
      The defendants in the suit are WPP Group and its units and
  Peters, who until January 29 was a director of J. Walter
  Thompson Co, JWT Group's main subsidiary and its president and
  chief operating officer.
      JWT said it asked the court to enjoin the defendants from
  acquiring any further JWT stock, make them return all
  confidential and proprietary information and to disgorge all
  profits or other gains.
      The company said it also asked the court to award JWT
  unspecified damages.
