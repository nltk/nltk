WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC &lt;WX> OPTIMISTIC FOR YEAR
  Westinghouse Electric Corp chairman
  Douglas Danforth said he was encouraged by first quarter
  results for fiscal 1987, and said the company was positioned to
  capitalize on the economy's modest growth for the rest of the
  year.
      "I am encouraged by the continuing improvement in
  earnings," Danworth said. "The first quarter met our
  expectations."
      Westinghouse recorded net income for the first quarter of
  151.6 mln dlrs, or 1.05 dlrs per share, on revenues of 2.32
  billion dlrs.
      Danworth attributed the results to an increase in the
  operating profit in the energy and advanced technology,
  industries and commerical segments.
