SAFEWAY AGREES TO SEVERANCE FOR DALLAS WORKERS
  The United Food and Commercial
  Workers Union said unlisted Safeway Inc has agreed to provide
  severance pay to about 5,000 workers in the Dallas area
  resulting from the closure of a division last April.
      The union said the total severance payment will be about
  five mln dlrs. It said the division was closed as a result of
  4.6 billion dlrs in debt incurred from a leveraged buyout last
  year.
      The union said it filed suit following the leveraged buyout
  to protect the claims of union members.
      The leveraged buyout was implemented to ward off a bid by
  Dart Group Corp &lt;DARTA.O>.
