REAGAN SENDS INT'L RUBBER AGREEMENT TO SENATE
  President Reagan sent the five-year
  International Natural Rubber Agreement to the Senate for
  approval.
      Reagan said the accord is designed to stabilize rubber
  prices without disturbing long-term market trends and to foster
  expanded natural rubber supplies at reasonable prices.
      It continues a buffer stock of not more than 550,000 tonnes
  established by a 197agreement. This will be used to defend a
  regularly adjusted price range and will be financed equally by
  importing and exporting members of the agreement.
