CCC PREPARING WHEAT CATALOGUE
  The Kansas City Commodity Credit Corp
  office is preparing a wheat catalogue containing roughly 300
  mln bushels, scheduled to be released in the next two to three
  weeks, a CCC spokesman said.
      The catalogue should include all CCC stocks stored at
  terminals and about 50 pct of the stocks stored at country
  elevators, the spokesman said. Hard red winter wheat should
  comprise the bulk of the stocks, followed by spring wheat, he
  said.
      The release date is tentative in case there are snags in
  the catalogue's preparation, the spokesman said.
