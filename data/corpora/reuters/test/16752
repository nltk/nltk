TAIWAN LIKELY TO BUY MORE U.S. SOYBEANS
  A 50 pct cut in the import tariff for
  soybeans should help boost 1987 U.S. Soybean exports to Taiwan,
  a spokesman for the joint committee of soybean importers told
  Reuters.
      He said the cut to 3.5 from seven pct was approved by the
  cabinet yesterday and would go into effect within a week.
      The cut will encourage local importers to increase 1987
  soybean imports to 1.9 mln tonnes from 1.74 mln last year, he
  said. The previous target for 1987 was 1.81 tonnes.
      Taiwan imports more than 90 pct of its soybeans from the
  U.S. And the rest from South America.
      The spokesman said the increase in imports from the U.S. Is
  in line with government efforts to reduce Taiwan's trade
  surplus with Washington, which rose to 3.61 billion U.S. Dlrs
  in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78 billion a year ago.
      "The tariff cut is very helpful for American suppliers (who
  want) to boost their exports to Taiwan," Steve Chen, country
  director of the American Soybean Association, told Reuters.
