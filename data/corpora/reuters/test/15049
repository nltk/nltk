FED EXPECTED TO SET CUSTOMER REPURCHASES
  The Federal Reserve is expected to
  intervene in the government securities market to supply
  temporary reserves indirectly via customer repurchase
  agreements, economists said.
      Economists expect the Fed to execute 2.0-2.5 billion dlrs
  of customer repos to offset pressures from the end of the
  two-week bank reserve maintenance period today. Some also look
  for a permanent reserve injection to offset seasonal pressures
  via an outright purchase of bills or coupons this afternoon.
       The Federal funds rate opened at 6-3/8 pct and remained at
  that level, up from yesterday's 6.17 pct average.
