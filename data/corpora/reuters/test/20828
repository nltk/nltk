SENATE BACKS U.S. RETALIATION IN GULF
  The U.S. Senate on Tuesday backed
  President Reagan's retaliatory strike against Iranian targets
  in the Gulf as it moved to take a greater role in making policy
  in the volatile region.
      Senators voted 92-1 for a non-binding measure that endorsed
  Monday's U.S. attack on two Iranian oil platforms in
  retaliation for an Iranian attack last Friday on a Kuwaiti ship
  flying the American flag.
      The measure said the attack was a firm indication of U.S.
  resolve that Iran "cannot take military action against the
  United States with impunity."
      Earlier, the Senate cut off Republican stalling tactics and
  set a vote on a measure that could give Congress a larger role
  in making Gulf policy. The measure, however, does not require
  Reagan to comply with the 1973 War Powers Act, which could lead
  to a pullout of U.S. forces from the Gulf.
      While Democrats and Republicans praised the U.S.
  retaliatory strike, many voiced new fears about the growing
  U.S. involvement in the Gulf and some demanded that Reagan
  comply with the War Powers Act.
