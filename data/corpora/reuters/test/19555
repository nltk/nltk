CANADA THREATENS BAN ON DANISH PIGMEAT IMPORTS
  Canada has threatened to stop imports
  of Danish pigmeat from July 14 after Canadian veterinary
  inspectors approved only two of 33 slaughterhouses, a Danish
  agriculture ministry official told Reuters.
      The Canadians postponed the original July 1 deadline at the
  request of the European Commission, which Denmark approached
  for support.
      Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen said in an
  interview with the daily Berlingske Tidende: "Denmark will not
  accept a ban on Danish meat exports, and I am sure we can reach
  an understanding with the Canadians with the help of the EC."
      Danish pigmeat exports to Canada were worth 106 mln crowns
  in 1986, while Canadian exports to the European Community
  totalled about 6.5 billion U.S. Dlrs.
      Some Danish slaughterhouse officials expressed suspicion
  that the Canadian action was in response to tightening up by EC
  veterinary inspectors on Canadian food exports to the EC.
      But an official at the Canadian embassy in Copenhagen said
  the inspection of Danish slaughterhouses was based on EC
  regulations. "Canadian officials are very concerned about the
  trade implications. We are holding active discussions with the
  EC and bilaterally," she added.
