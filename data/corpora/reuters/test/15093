RAYTHEON &lt;RTN> NET RISES ON OPERATIONS
  Raytheon said a 10 pct rise in
  its first quarter net to 101.8 mln dlrs reflected improved
  operations and a lower effective tax rate.
      The company said revenue gains in electronics, major
  appliances and other lines were offset by decreases in energy
  services and aircraft products. Revenues in the quarter rose
  1.4 pct to 1.75 billion dlrs, it said.
      The company said backlog stood at 7.520 billion dlrs, down
  from 7.912 billion dlrs a year earlier. It said a five year
  3.55 billion dlr U.S. defense contract was awarded shortly
  after the close of the first quarter.
