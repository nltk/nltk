SINGAPORE OIL COMPANIES TO SET OWN PUMP PRICES
  Singapore oil companies can set their
  own petrol and diesel prices at the pump from today subject to
  ceilings determined by their individual wholesale prices, The
  Ministry of Trade and Industry said.
      The ministry previously revised pump prices and announced
  the changes for the oil companies.
      Lead content of petrol is further cut to 0.15 gm/litre from
  0.4 gm from today. Pump prices of the lower lead petrol grades
  are expected to be announced soon by the oil companies which
  have said wholesale prices are between 1.3 cents/litre to 3.2
  cents higher than previous grades.
