FORD &lt;F> DEVELOPING ALUMINUM CAR FRAME
  Ford Motor Co said it is developing an
  aluminum space frame for its Probe V concept car using extruded
  stretch-formed aluminum that could lead to new techniques for
  building production cars in the future.
      It said the frame would reduce vehicle weight and cost
  while maintaining structural integrity and crashworthiness. The
  frame has fewer parts than conventional steel frames, Ford
  said.  The company said the lighter weight would allow smaller
  powertrains and suspensions, further reducing weight and
  improving fuel economy.
      Ford said in addition, extrusion dies cost 1,000 to 12,000
  dlrs each, compared with hundreds of thousands of dollars for
  steel stamping dies, and using extruded aluminum the number of
  welds in a car could be reduced to about 40 from over 2,000.
