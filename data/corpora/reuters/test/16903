WHITE HOUSE SAYS U.S. MONETARY POLICY CORRECT
  The White House,
  distancing itself from remarks by the administration's budget
  chief, said the Federal Reserve's current course of monetary
  policy was appropriate.
      "The administration feels that the current course of
  monetary policy is appropriate," White House spokesman Marlin
  Fitwater said.
      Fitzwater said the administration did not endorse remarks
  by White House budget chief James Miller, who said he was
  concerned the Federal Reserve might overreact to the decline in
  the value of the U.S. dollar by raising interest rates.
