NBC NEWS SAYS U.S. HAS RETALIATED AGAINST IRAN
  U.S. television networks said on
  Monday that U.S. forces launched a retaliatory strike against
  Iran late Sunday, apparently attacking two Iranian offshore oil
  drilling platforms.
      NBC News said it understood six Iranians had been pulled
  from the sea.
      It said cautiously that U.S. forces attacked late Sunday
  and that two Iranian oil platforms east of Bahrain were ablaze
  as a result, but CBS News and other networks said flatly that
  U.S. forces attacked the Iranian oil platforms.
      U.S. officials had been meeting on a response since Friday
  when an attack on a Kuwaiti port severely damaged a
  U.S.-flagged ship.
      President Reagan said on Sunday he had already made a
  decision on the U.S. response to Friday's Iran attack but would
  not say what the decision was.
      Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on Saturday the
  attack on a U.S.-flagged ship in Kuwaiti waters on Friday was
  almost certainly by an Iran Silkworm missile.
