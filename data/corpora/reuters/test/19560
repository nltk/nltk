IRAQ REJECTS NEW OPEC OIL QUOTA
  Iraq has rejected its new OPEC
  production quota set in Vienna for the second half of this
  year, the official Iraqi news agency INA reported.
      It quoted Oil Minister Issam Abdul-Rahim al-Chalabi, who
  returned Sunday, as saying "Iraq will continue to adhere to its
  position considering itself as not included in the agreement."
  
      Last December, Iraq rejected its assigned first half 1987
  quota of 1.466 mln bpd and demanded a share equal to the 2.255
  mln bpd quota set for Iran, its enemy in the nearly
  seven-year-old Gulf war.
      The accord reached by OPEC ministers in Vienna Saturday set
  an output ceiling of 16.6 mln bpd for the group's 13 members
  from July to December, raising Iraq's share to 1.54 mln bpd and
  Iran's to 2.369 mln.
