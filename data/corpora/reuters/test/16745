MIYAZAWA SEES EVENTUAL LOWER U.S. TRADE DEFICIT
  Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa
  told a press conference he expects the U.S. Trade deficit to
  eventually start reflecting economic fundamentals, which should
  influence exchange rates.
      The minister was not referring to the U.S. Trade data to be
  released in Washington later today.
      Miyazawa also said he told major industrial nations when he
  was in Washington last week that present exchange rates are not
  necessarily good. He had said earlier in Washington that
  current exchange rates were within levels implied in the
  February Paris currency accord.
