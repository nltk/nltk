MONTEDISON'S AGRIMONT UNIT 1986 EARNINGS
  &lt;Montedison SPA> of Italy said net
  consolidated profit for its Agrimont Group, formed in June
  1986, totalled 1.5 billion lire in 1986.
      Agrimont SPA, the holding company for Montedison's
  Agro-Industrial businesses, had sales of 810 billion lire and a
  net profit of about 1.1 billion lire, after amortization costs
  of 35 billion lire and a 13 billion lire reduction in the value
  of inventory due to falling market prices, Montedison said.
      Agrimont, still wholly owned by Montedison, is taking steps
  to be traded on the Milan exchange, the company said.
      The company said that 1986 was characterized by an unstable
  fertlizer market due to the weak dollar and the decline of
  international prices for products sold in Europe and the U.S
  where Agrimont operates through its Conserv division.
      In pesticides and in animal health care products Agrimont
  maintained its previous level of revenues and market share in
  1986, Montedison said.
      Montedison said it named Ettore dell'Isola to the newly
  created position of president of Agrimont.
      Montedison also said it named Renato Picco, managing
  director of &lt;Eridania SPA> and Gianfranco Ceroni, managing
  director of &lt;Italiana Olii e Sifi>, both of whom are members
  of the the Ferruzzi Group's management board, to Argimont's
  board of directors. Ferruzzi owns about 40 pct of Montedison,
  the company said.
