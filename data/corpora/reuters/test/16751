TAIWAN IMPORTS 210,000 TONNES SOUTH AFRICAN MAIZE
  Taiwan imported about 210,000 tonnes of
  South African maize between January 1 and April 13, the joint
  committee of local maize importers said.
      Under a three-year agreement signed last year, South Africa
  will export 600,000 tonnes of maize a year to Taiwan.
      A committee spokesman told Reuters the rest of this year's
  quota will be shipped during the rest of 1987.
