LONDON GOLD MORNING FIX HIGHEST SINCE OCTOBER
  Gold bullion continued to move higher
  supported by good general buying and was fixed this morning at
  436.50 dlrs, 268.368 stg, an ounce, up from Friday's close of
  432.00/50, dealers said.
      The setting was the highest since October 8 as gold built
  on Friday's gains, which had been based on the weakness of the
  dollar and fears of a trade war between the United States and
  Japan.
      It opened slightly firmer at 433.50/434.00 and moved up
  steadily during the morning supported by commission house and
  trade buying, dealers said.
      Dealers said there was resistance around 440.00 but with
  sentiment still firm some traders believe the rally may even
  take gold as high as 500 dlrs.
      Platinum was fixed this morning at 583.50 dlrs an ounce, up
  from Friday's close of 578.50/580.50, and also the highest
  setting since October.
