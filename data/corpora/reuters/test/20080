LOUVRE ACCORD VITAL TO W.GERMANY - STOLTENBERG
  West German Finance Minister Gerhard
  Stoltenberg said the Louvre accord was vital to West Germany.
      Stoltenberg told a news conference "Given West Germany's
  unusually high dependence on world trade and exports, it is
  vital for West Germany ... To continue its constructive
  contribution to trusting (international) cooperation on the
  basis of the Louvre accord."
      Some monetary analysts have speculated that
  inflation-conscious Bundesbank vice president Helmut
  Schlesinger may have been leading the central bank to a course
  of tighter monetary policy.
      Stoltenberg is due to attend a routine Bundesbank meeting
  on Thursday in West Berlin. He declined to forecast what, if
  any, policy decisions the Bundesbank might take.
