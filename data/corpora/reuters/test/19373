FAIRLY HECTIC WEEK IN RAW SUGAR, WOODHOUSE SAYS
  It has been a fairly hectic trading week
  in raw sugar with China paying market levels for nearby
  shipments, London trader, Woodhouse, Drake and Carey, said in
  its weekly report.
      July shipment Thai raws traded to China early in the week
  at fob levels equivalent to 20/25 points discount to July New
  York futures, it said. Mid-week saw these same sales covered by
  the trade at 10/15 points discount.
      Enquiries for July/Sep 15 raw sugars then filtered in and
  here again, traded values rose quickly from 13 points premium
  to New York July up to 18, Woodhouse said.
      In the Western Hemisphere, both Dominican Republic and
  Mexican nearby raws were bid 15 points discount to July New
  York and offered five points under, but in limited trading, it
  said.
      All the action of the past week has been in the Far East
  raws market whereas the whites market saw little fresh prospect
  of nearby offtake, Whitehouse added.
