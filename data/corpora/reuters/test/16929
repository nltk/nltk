YEUTTER ALMOST SURE JAPAN WILL NOT RETALIATE
  U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
  Yeutter said he was almost sure Japan would not retaliate
  against tariffs President Reagan slapped on 300 mln dlrs of
  Japanese electronic goods today.
      "I'd say it's 99 plus pct sure that it (the tariffs) will
  not provoke a retaliation on American products," Yeutter told
  Cable News Network.
      "Japan has far too much at stake in this relationship (with
  the United States) to seriously entertain thoughts of
  retaliation," Yeutter said.
      Earlier today, Reagan 
  imposed 100 pct tariffs on a range of
  Japanese goods in retaliation for Japan's alleged violation of
  a bilateral pact governing semiconductor trade.
      Yeutter did say that U.S. farm products would be targeted
  if Tokyo decided to hit back.
      "If they (Japan) were to retaliate, it would probably be on
  something like American agricultural products," he said.
      "But I really think the chances of that happening are
  between slim and none," he added.
