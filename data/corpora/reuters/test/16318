WORK ON GREEK ALUMINA PLANT TO START END MAY
  Preparatory work for construction of a
  450 mln dlr alumina plant near the village of Aghia Efthymia in
  the Greek province of Fokida will begin at the end of next
  month and the plant will be operational by 1992, Industry
  Undersecretary George Petsos said.
      Greece yesterday signed contracts with the Soviet Union for
  the joint venture project, the biggest investment in the
  country for 20 years.
      Petsos said the Soviet Union, which had initially agreed to
  buy 380,000 tonnes, would now purchase the plant's entire
  output of 600,000 tonnes a year.
