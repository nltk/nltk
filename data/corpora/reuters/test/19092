BELGIAN ONE-DAY STRIKE HITS TRANSPORT, SHIPPING
  A 24-hour strike by Belgian public
  employees protesting against a government pay offer disrupted
  transport and hit ferry services and shipping, port and union
  officials said.
      Some cross-Channel ferry services from Ostend were
  cancelled, the local news agency Belga said.
      An Antwerp port authority spokesman said electricians came
  out in support, reducing ship movements to a trickle. Unions
  said Ghent and other major Belgian ports were also hit.
      Few trains were running and some early morning flights by
  Sabena, Belgian's national airline, were cancelled.
