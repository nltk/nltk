COAST SAVINGS &lt;CSA> IN TALKS ON BUYING BANK
  Coast Savings and Loan Association
  said it is in talks with the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance
  Corp on the acquisition of Central Savings and Loan Association
  of San Diego.
      Central, which operates 46 branches, has been under
  management guidance of the FSLIC since May 1985.
      Coast said the acquisition would give it an entry into the
  San Joaquin Valley market besides strengthening its presence in
  the San Diego, Los Angeles and Orange Counties areas.
