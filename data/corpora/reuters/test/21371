WORLD TELECOMS WATCHDOG RELAXES CAR PHONE RULES
  The International Telecommunications
  Union, which regulates communications worldwide, decided at the
  end of a five-week conference to allow mobile phone systems to
  be linked with satellites, telecommunications officials said.
      Until now, car phones have been linked with land stations
  and have been limited mainly to urban areas. The new ruling
  will make it easier for calls to be made from remote regions.
      The meeting, which finished over the weekend, also decided
  to allow a "radio determination satellite system," which would
  enable fleet owners to trace to within about 15 metres the
  movements of their lorries or cars or ships around the world.
