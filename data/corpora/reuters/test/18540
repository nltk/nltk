U.K. EARNINGS UP UNDERLYING 7.75 PCT IN APRIL
  U.K. Average earnings rose a seasonally
  adjusted 6.5 pct in the year to end-April, after increasing by
  6.7 pct annually in March, the Employment Department said.
      The April index, base 1980, was set at a provisional,
  seasonally-adjusted 197.3, up from 194.8 in March.
      But the underlying rise was 7.75 pct, up 0.25 pct from
  March and back to the same level seen late last year.
      The underlying rise is adjusted for factors such as
  back-pay and timing variations.
      Unit wage costs in U.K. Manufacturing industry rose one pct
  in the year to April, after an upward revised rise of 0.7 pct
  in the period to March, the Department of Employment added.
      In the three months to end-April, such costs were 0.9 pct
  higher, year-on-year, compared with a rise of 1.2 pct in the
  three months to March.
      Manufacturing productivity in April was 6.1 pct higher than
  a year ago after a downward revised 6.8 pct increase in March.
  In the last three months period manufacturing productivity was
  up 6.7 pct, having increased 6.5 pct in the first quarter.
