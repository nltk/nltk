EC MAINLY FOR TIN EXTENSION, NO U.K. STAND TAKEN
  European Community (EC) members of the
  International Tin Council, except Britain, have said they are
  prepared to back an extension of the International Tin
  Agreement, an EC spokesman said.
      He said at a meeting of EC states' representatives here
  yesterday, Britain undertook to communicate its own decision to
  its partners today. It said it was not ready yesterday to take
  a stand but did not say why.
      He added nine other EC states backed an extension. Spain
  and Portugal, which are not members of the International Tin
  Council, raised no objections to a common EC stance in favour.
