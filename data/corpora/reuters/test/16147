CHINA RAISES GRAIN PURCHASE PRICES
  China has raised the state purchase
  prices of corn, rice, cottonseed and shelled peanuts from April
  1 to encourage farmers to grow them, the official China
  Commercial Daily said.
      The paper said the price paid for corn from 14 northern
  provinces, cities and regions has increased by one yuan per 50
  kg. A foreign agricultural expert said the rise will take the
  price to 17 fen per jin (0.5 kg) from 16 fen.
      The paper said the price for long-grained rice from 10
  southern provinces and cities was raised by 1.5 yuan per 50 kg.
      The paper said the price for round-grained rice from 11
  provinces, regions and cities in central, east and northwest
  China has been increased by 1.75 yuan per 50 kg. It gave no
  more price details.
      It said local authorities must inform farmers of the price
  increases before farmers begin planting, to encourage
  production of grains and oilseeds.
      Chinese officials have said farmers are unwilling to grow
  grain because they can earn more from other crops.
