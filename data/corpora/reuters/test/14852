BOND CORP STILL CONSIDERING ATLAS MINING BAIL-OUT
  Bond Corp Holdings Ltd &lt;BONA.S> and Atlas
  Consolidated Mining and Development Corp &lt;ATLC.MN> are still
  holding talks on a bail-out package for the troubled mining
  firm, an Atlas statement said.
      Atlas, the Philippines' biggest copper producer, said it
  had been hit by depressed world copper prices. It reported a
  net loss of 976.38 mln pesos in the year ending December 1986,
  compared with a net loss of 1.53 billion in 1985.
      The company said it had been able to cut its losses because
  its scaled-down copper operations in the central island of Cebu
  started in the second half of 1986.
      Atlas said negotiations were continuing on the acquisition
  by Bond of the company's existing bank loans and their
  restructuring into a gold loan.
      A memorandum of understanding signed by the two sides in
  October last year said Bond would acquire Atlas' total loans of
  275 mln dlrs, to be repaid by the mining company in gold.
      Atlas said the two sides were also discussing equity
  infusion into Atlas and the creation of a development fund for
  further exploration and development of the company's gold
  properties in the central province of Masbate.
      Wilson Banks, general manager of &lt;Bond Corp International
  Ltd> in Hong Kong, told Reuters the Atlas statement on the
  negotiations was "reasonably accurate."
      Banks said Bond Corp was seriously considering several
  investments in the Philippines but did not give details.
      In its statement, Atlas said development of the pre-World
  War Two underground mines in Masbate had been accelerated and
  the ore tonnage had increased, extending the operation's life
  at least until 1993.
