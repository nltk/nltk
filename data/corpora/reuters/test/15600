  General Partners told the Securities
  and Exchange Commission it has reduced its stake in GenCorp Inc
  to 8.6 pct, from 9.8 pct, by selling 250,000 shares at a price
  equal to 118.5 dlrs per share.
      General Partners, which includes GC Holdings Inc and
  General Acquisitions Inc, said yesterday it was dropping its
  100-dlr-a-share hostile takeover bid for GenCorp because of
  GenCorp's move to buy back its shares for up to 130 dlrs each.
