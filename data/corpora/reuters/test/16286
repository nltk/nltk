GIANT BAY &lt;GBYLF> IN IDAHO GOLD VENTURE
  Giant Bay Resources
  Ltd said it signed an agreement in principle with Hecla Mining
  Co for an operating joint venture on Hecla's Stibnite, Idaho,
  gold deposit.
      Giant Bay said if its bioleaching technology is used for
  ore processing, it will have the right to acquire a working
  interest in the property. It said it may spend as much as three
  mln U.S. dlrs, excluding capital costs to bring the mine into
  production. It said drilling has indicated substantial sulphide
  reserves with a gold grade of about 0.1 ounce a ton, and early
  tests show the gold ore responds to bioleaching.
