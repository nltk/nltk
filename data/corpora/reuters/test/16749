HAITIAN CANE PLANTERS PROTEST SUGAR MILL CLOSURE
  About 2,000 sugar cane planters
  marched to Port-au-Prince to protest against the closure of
  Haiti's largest sugar mill and second biggest employer.
      The Haitian American Sugar Company closed on Friday because
  of a huge surplus of unsold sugar. The firm said Haiti has been
  flooded with smuggled refined and unrefined sugar from the
  Dominican Republic and refined U.S. Sugar from Miami.
      The closure idled 3,500 factory workers and left 30,000
  small cane planters with no outlet for their cane. The
  protesters blamed Finance Minister Lesly Delatour for the
  closure, saying his policies have hurt Haitian businesses.
