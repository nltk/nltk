SANTOS SAYS IT HAS SIGNIFICANT OIL FIND
  Santos Ltd &lt;STOS.S> said it had made a
  significant oil discovery at its Mawson One well in the Moomba
  block of the Cooper Basin, South Australia.
      It said the well flowed oil from sands at an average rate
  of 1,440 barrels per day from 2,131 to 2,135 metres through a
  6mm choke.
      Santos said the well was cased and suspended pending
  further evaluation. But it said the proximity of the discovery
  to existing production facilities at the Gidgealpa South field
  would allow Mawson One to be brought into production rapidly.
      Santos has a 60 pct stake in the block, &lt;Delhi Petroleum
  Pty Ltd> has 30 pct and &lt;South Australian Oil and Gas Corp Pty
  Ltd> has 10 pct.
