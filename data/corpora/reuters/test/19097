CHINA RESUMES USSR SHIP REPAIRS AFTER 23 YEAR GAP
  China has resumed repairs of Soviet ships
  after a 23 year break caused by the ideological split between
  the two countries.
      The New China News Agency said an agreement to resume the
  business was signed by the two sides on Wednesday in Shanghai,
  where three Soviet commercial vessels were being repaired.
      The China Daily said the first two Soviet ships to be
  repaired in China since 1964 left the ports of Dalian and
  Xingang last month.
      Bi Yueran, managing director of China State Shipbuilding
  Corp's ship repair department, told the newspaper the Soviet
  Union lacked adequate repair facilities for the more than 600
  ships deployed in the far east. Bi said China's yards offered
  competitive prices, guaranteed quality and prompt delivery.
