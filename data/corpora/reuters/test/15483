MIYAZAWA SAYS YEN STILL INSIDE PARIS RANGE
  Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi
  Miyazawa said the strengthening of the yen against the dollar
  since the Paris Agreement was within the range agreed in the
  Louvre discussions.
      "I would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the past
  several weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the
  discussions in Paris," Miyazawa told a press conference
  following the Group of Seven meeting here.
      He said the current discussions were a "reaffirmation" of
  that agreement, saying the "solidarity" that occurred in Paris
  was still in place.
