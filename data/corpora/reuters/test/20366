RUMORS THAT USSR BUYS U.S. CORN - TRADERS
  Rumors circulated among the trade
  this morning that the USSR may have purchased between one and
  two mln tonnes of U.S. corn, but there was no confirmation.
      One dealer said he felt some business had been done, but
  that the amount probably was on the low end of trade estimates.
