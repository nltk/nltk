EUROPEAN MARKETS REACT QUIETLY TO G-7 COMMUNIQUE
  European currency markets reacted quietly
  to the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealers
  ranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete to
  surprise that the markets should have expected so much.
      The dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies
  and traded in a narrow range after the communique, which
  reaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currency
  stabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it.
      Frankfurt and Zurich dealers saw the dollar staying broadly
  entrenched in its current trading range.
