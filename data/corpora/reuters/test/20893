LAWSON WELCOMES REAFFIRMATION OF LOUVRE ACCORD
  U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
  Lawson welcomed on Monday the reaffirmation by the U.S. And
  West Germany of the Louvre accord aimed at stabilising
  currencies.
      His office said Lawson had welcomed the outcome of a
  meeting between U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker, Bundesbank
  President Karl Otto Poehl, and West German Finance Minister
  Gerhard Stoltenberg in Frankfurt.
      After the meeting, a Bonn finance ministry spokesman quoted
  Stoltenberg as saying he was confident that foreign currencies
  could be stabilised at around current levels.
      The meeting came after Baker criticised West Germany for
  increasing key interest rates, saying they were not in line
  with last February's Louvre accord.
