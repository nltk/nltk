U.S. MAY END ADDITIONAL SANCTIONS AGAINST JAPAN
  The United States may lift an
  additional 84 mln dlrs in trade sanctions against Japan later
  this month, Reagan Administration officials said.
      President Reagan imposed 300 mln dlrs in sanctions on
  Japanese goods last April for its failure to honor a 1986
  agreement to end dumping semiconductors in the U.S. and third
  country markets and to open its home market to U.S. goods.
      The move raised tariffs to 100 pct from about five pct on
  Japanese color television sets, hand-held power tools and
  portable computers.
      Reagan lifted 51 mln dlrs of the sanctions last June  after
  Japan ended selling the semiconductors on the U.S. market at
  below production costs.
      Semiconductors are the small silicon chips used for memory
  and recall purposes in a wide variety of computers.
      The Administration officials said Commerce Department 
  monitors showed that Japan was ending its dumping of the
  semiconductors in third countries, where they had been taking
  sales away from American-made semiconductors.
      They said it was likely the 51 mln dlrs in sanctions would
  be lifted by the end of the month.
      The United States and Japan remain at odds over opening the
  closed Japanese markets to U.S. goods.
      U.S. and Japanese officials reviewed Japan's compliance
  with the agreement earlier this week.
      The periodic reviews are to continue and the remaining
  sanctions to stay in force, the officials said, until Japan is
  in full compliance with the semiconductor agreement.
