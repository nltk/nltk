RTZ SEES RISING U.S. OUTPUT AIDING 1987 RESULTS
  Rio Tinto-Zinc Corp Plc &lt;RTZL.L>, RTZ,
  said the predicted rise in industrial production in the U.S.
  And Europe should boost its 1987 performance.
      Consumption of some base metals and their dlr prices are
  showing signs of improvement, although iron ore markets have
  weakened. The oil price in U.S. Dlrs is above the 1986 average,
  and if sustained, should improve energy earnings.
      The company was commenting in a statement on its 1986
  results which, on a restated basis, showed net attributable
  profits lower at 245 mln stg after 257 mln the previous year.
  Pretax profits also dipped to 601.7 mln stg after 614.4 mln.
      RTZ said the excellent performance of its expanding range
  of industrial businesses in 1986 was offset by the collapse in
  oil prices.
      Industrial businesses contributed 202 mln stg to net
  profit, a 40 pct increase from 144 mln in 1985, and 60 pct of
  the total. Trading performance improved at wholly-owned
  subsidiaries RTZ Borax Ltd, RTZ Cement Ltd, RTZ Chemicals Ltd
  and RTZ Pillar Ltd. First time contributions from recent
  investment and acquisitions mainly in speciality chemicals and
  minerals also aided performance.
      Metals activities contributed 83 mln stg to net profit.
