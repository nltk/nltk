ARAB HEAVY TERM CRUDE SUPPLIES TO JAPAN UP IN JULY
  &lt;Aramco Corp> has accepted Japanese
  nominations to lift a higher proportion of Arab Heavy crude oil
  under term contracts in July, oil industry sources said.
      Japanese companies requested a ratio of 80 pct Arab Heavy
  to 20 pct Arab Light under a term contract agreement with
  Aramco for 100,000 barrels per day, the sources said. The
  contractual ratio is 30 pct heavy crude to 70 pct light.
      Japanese demand for heavy crude oil has increased
  substantially since the All Japan Seaman's Union ceased sailing
  into the northern Mideast gulf last month, causing problems
  with liftings of heavy Kuwait and Khafji crudes.
