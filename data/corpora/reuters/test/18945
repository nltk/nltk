FORCE MAJEURE LIFTED AT CAJAMARQUILLA
  Peru's state minerals marketing arm, Minero
  Peru Comercial SA (Minpeco), lifted a force majeure on zinc
  ingot shipments from the country's biggest zinc refinery at
  Cajamarquilla, a spokesman said.
      The spokesman said the problems affecting sulphuric acid
  and roaster plants that had halted production since May 4 had
  been resolved.
      However, he said production of zinc ingots this year was
  expected to fall to around 86,000 tonnes this year at
  Cajamarquilla, from 94,000 tonnes in 1986 because of the
  stoppage.
      The refinery has an optimum annual production capacity of
  100,000 tonnes but its highest production was 96,000 tonnes of
  refined zinc ingots in 1985, the spokesman said.
