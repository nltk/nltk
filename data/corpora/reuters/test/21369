TASS DENOUNCES U.S. ATTACK ON IRAN AS ADVENTURISM
  The official Soviet news agency Tass
  denounced a U.S. Attack on an Iranian oil-drilling platform in
  the Gulf on Monday as military adventurism and said it would
  bring no dividends to the Reagan administration.
      Tass commentator Mikhail Krutikhin said the administration
  had embarked on an adventurist path in order to deflect
  attention from the scandal in which the United States sold arms
  to Iran and the profits were diverted to Nicaraguan rebels.
      "The confrontation is a fact now. What is obvious is that
  the latest military adventure will not bring political
  dividends to the American administration," Krutikhin said.
      Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Eduard
  Shevardnadze abruptly left a parliamentary session earlier on
  Monday, sparking diplomatic speculation that they were
  concerned with an urgent matter of foreign affairs.
      Soviet officials have previously criticized the United
  States for sending naval forces into the Gulf, saying their
  presence serves to increase tension.
      Moscow is officially neutral in the war between Iran and
  Iraq. It is a major arms supplier to Iraq but has also sought
  broader contacts with Iran in the last year.
      Krutikhin said: "The United States has undertaken an act of
  armed aggression against Iran, the probability of which has
  long been spoken of by Washington officials."
