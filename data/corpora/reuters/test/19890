  CXR Telcom Corp and Torotel
  Inc agreed in principle to settle pending litigation regarding
  the sale of Torotel's former Halcyon Communications Inc unit to
  CXR in March, 1986, the two companies said in a joint
  statement.
      The agreement calls for CXR to pay to Torotel 1,350,000
  dlrs in exchange for return of a 2.5 mln dlr note and five mln
  CXR common shares valued at 1,7754,000 mln dlrs, the companies
  said.
      In June, 1986 CXR filed the suit in San Francisco federal
  court, charging that the 10.3 mln dlr price it paid for Halycon
  was excessive, Torotel said.
      It also said that in is suit CXR asked for seven mln dlrs
  in damages, along with an unspecified punitive award.
