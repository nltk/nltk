IRWIN JACOBS HAS GILLETTE &lt;GS> STAKE
  Investor Irwin Jacobs said he has an
  investment in Gillette Co amounting to less than five pct of
  the consumer products company's stock.
      Jacobs, who made his comment in response to an enquiry, did
  not comment further.
      Yesterday, Gillette rebuffed a takeover proposal from
  Revlon Inc. Under an agreement between the two companies,
  Revlon must have the permission of Gillette's board before
  making an offer to shareholders. The board declined to grant
  that permission.
     
      Gillette has been the topic of takeover speculation for
  several weeks. Its stock has traded heavily, and arbitragers
  said they believe Jacobs may not be the only investor who has a
  sizeable position in the company.
