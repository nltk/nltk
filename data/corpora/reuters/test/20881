U.S., AT U.N., CLAIMS SELF-DEFENSE FOR GULF ATTACK
  The United States invoked the right
  of self-defense in destroying an Iranian oil platform in the
  Gulf, the American delegation told the United Nations.
      Lieutenant General Vernon Walters sent letters about the
  incident to Security Council President Maurizio Bucci, the
  delegate of Italy, and Secretary General Javier Perez de
  Cuellar.
      U.N. press secretary Francois Giuliani said the Secretary
  General had no comment on the attack, which followed his appeal
  last Friday for restraint in the crisis while he pursued
  efforts to obtain a ceasefire between Iran and Iraq.
      In his explanation, Walters said the United States took
  defensive action in response to an Iranian attack against
  American ships in the Gulf.
      He cited an Iranian Silkworm missile strike last Friday in
  Kuwait waters against the United States-flag ship Sea Isle
  City.
      Walters said that military forces on the destroyed Iranian
  platform had engaged in a variety of actions against United
  States-flag and other nonbelligerent vessels and planes.
      "In accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations
  (Charter), I wish, on behalf of my government, to report that
  United States forces have exercised the inherent right of
  self-defense under internation law by taking defensive action
  in response to attacks by . . . Iran against United States
  vessels in the Gulf," Walters said.
      Members of the Security Council met behind closed doors on
  Monday to discuss developments in the Gulf war, but no
  statement was issued afterwards.
