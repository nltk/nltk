ANDRIESSEN HINTS FATS/OIL TAX COULD GO TO SUMMIT
  European Community (EC)
  Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen said his proposal for
  a tax of up to 330 European Currency Units per tonne on oils
  and fats was likely to go up for discussion at next week's
  summit meeting of EC leaders.
      EC farm ministers have been unable to agree the tax, one of
  the main items proposed by Andriessen for the 1987-88 farm
  price package.
      The tax, which would apply on both domestically-produced
  and imported oils and fats, has been fiercely opposed by the
  United States and developing countries' vegetable and marine
  oil producers.
