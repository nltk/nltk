U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN 75 MLN STG ASSISTANCE
  The Bank of England said it had provided
  the money market with 75 mln stg help in the morning session.
  This compares with the Bank's estimate that the system would
  face a shortage of around 400 mln stg today.
      The central bank bought bank bills outright comprising two
  mln stg in band two at 9-13/16 pct, 15 mln stg in band three at
  9-3/4 pct and 58 mln stg in band three at 9-11/16 pct.
