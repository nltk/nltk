FED MAY ADD RESERVES TO BANKING SYSTEM
  The Federal Reserve may intervene in
  the government securities market to supply temporary reserves
  indirectly via customer repurchase agreements, economists said.
      They said that while the Fed faces no great urgency to add
  reserves at the start of the two-week maintenance period today
  it would probably do so in order to offset a relatively high
  federal funds rate.
      Fed funds opened at 6-3/16 pct and remained there in early
  trading. Yesterday, they averaged 6.45 pct, after rising as
  high as seven pct at the close.
