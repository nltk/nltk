CARTER HAWLEY &lt;CHH> SETS RECORD DATE FOR VOTE
  Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc said
  it has set June 29 as the record date for shareholders voting
  on the company's proposed restructuring at its annual meeting.
      The company has yet to set a date for the meeting, but has
  said it will be held before the end of August.
      Under the proposal, Carter Hawley would split into a
  specialty store company and a department store company.
      Shareholders would get 17-dlrs in cash and a share in each
  of the two new companies for each existing common share they
  hold. The restructuring was announced in December, after Carter
  Hawley rejected a buy-out offer by Retail Partners.
