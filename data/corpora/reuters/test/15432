MIYAZAWA SAYS YEN STILL INSIDE PARIS RANGE
  Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi
  Miyazawa said the strengthening of the yen against the dollar
  that has occurred since the Paris Agreement was within the
  range agreed on in the Louvre discussions.
      "I would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the past
  several weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the
  discussions in Paris," Miyazawa told a press conference
  following the Group of Seven meeting here.
      He added that the current discussions were a "reaffirmation"
  of that agreement, indicating that the "solidarity" that occurred
  in Paris was still in place.
