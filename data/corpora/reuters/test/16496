UNITED TELECOM &lt;UT> REPORTS US SPRINT LOSS
  United Telecommunications Inc
  said its lower first quarter earnings included a loss of
  63,055,000 dlrs from its equity in US Sprint.
      US Sprint was formed July 1, 1986, as a partnership which
  combined United Telecommunications' long distance voice and
  data operations with those of GTE Corp &lt;GTE>.
      Earlier, United Telecommunications reported first-quarter
  earnings of 12.6 mln dlrs, or 13 cts a share compared to 46.4
  mln dlrs, or 47 cts a share a year ago. Revenues declined to
  720.2 mln dlrs from 793.6 mln dlrs.
      United Telecommunications said the transition of US
  Sprint's nationwide fiberoptic network is proceeding ahead of
  schedule.
      It said the transition to the fiber network from interim
  networks would not only reduce operating costs in the second
  half of 1987, but also assist in controlling unauthorized
  network use.
