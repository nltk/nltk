SOVIET TRADE DEFICIT WITH WEST SOARS IN 1986
  The Soviet trade deficit with the West
  almost quadrupled last year, reaching 2.72 billion roubles
  compared with 713 mln in 1985, official figures showed.
      Statistics published by the monthly journal Foreign Trade
  showed Soviet trade turnover for 1986 fell to 130.9 billion
  roubles from 142.1 billion the previous year, a drop of 7.8
  pct.
      Moscow's trade surplus with East Bloc countries continued
  to grow in 1986.
      Western analysts attributed the deficit rise with the West
  to the world oil price slump, which hit Moscow's main export
  and cut hard currency earnings needed for purchases in the
  West.
