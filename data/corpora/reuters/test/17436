IRAN SAYS IT WILL COMBAT GULF INTERVENTION
  Iranian foreign minister Ali Akbar
  Velayati warned that Iran would combat any superpower
  intervention in the Gulf.
      "Iran, which is the most powerful (country) in the Gulf...
  Will not allow the superpowers or any other foreign forces to
  interfere in the region," he said.
      Velayati, visiting the United Arab Emirates on the first
  leg of a Gulf tour, told reporters Iran had the "capabilities
  and means" to prevent any interference. President Reagan has
  pledged to keep the Gulf sealanes open and to protect Kuwaiti
  tankers from possible Iranian attack.
