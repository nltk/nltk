BECOR WESTERN &lt;BCW> TALKS TO FOURTH BIDDER
  Becor Western Inc said it
  is talking with a possible fourth bidder for the company.
      The company also said Lynch Corp &lt;LGL> has renewed its
  offer for Becor which was withdrawn last week.
      Talks with the possible bidder are expected to be concluded
  shortly, Becor said, adding its board will evaluate all then
  existing offers at that time.
      In the meantime, the company said, it plans today to
  adjourn further its meeting of stockholders to June 30. That
  meeting was called to act on a merger agreement calling for a
  buyout by BCW Acquisitions Inc.
      The third identified Becor suitor is &lt;Davis Mining and
  Manufacturing Inc>.
      In Fairfield, N.J., Lynch said its latest proposal calls
  Lynch to own 75 pct of Becor's stock and Becor holders to
  retain the other 25 pct.
      Peviously, Lynch would have held about 25 pct, with Becor
  holders receiving 25 pct and Becor management about half.
      Lynch said the proposal was changed because it believes
  Becor's management "needs more guidance in terms of financial
  structuring.
