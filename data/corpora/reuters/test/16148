WEST GERMAN COCOA GRINDINGS WITHIN EXPECTATIONS
  West German first quarter cocoa
  grindings, which rose 2.9 pct from the same 1986 quarter, were
  within expectations, trade sources said.
      They described the results, announced Saturday, as normal
  and unspectacular, considering that the grind in the fourth
  quarter was rather high and some was carried over into the
  first quarter.
      Grindings rose to 55,190 tonnes from 53,643 in the first
  1986 quarter. A spokesman for the Confectionery Industry
  Association said that West German grindings are expected to
  stay relatively high in comparison to other West European
  countries.
