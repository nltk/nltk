U.K. MONEY MARKET DEFICIT FORECAST AT 250 MLN STG
  The Bank of England said it forecast a
  shortage of around 250 mln stg in the money market today.
      Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing
  in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain
  some 505 mln stg, while bills for repurchase by the market will
  remove around 194 mln. In addition, a rise in note circulation
  and bankers' balances below target will each drain around 110
  mln stg.
      Partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions
  will add some 690 mln stg to the system today.
