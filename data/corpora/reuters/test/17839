ENTERTAINMENT MARKETING TOPS CRAZY EDDIE OFFER
  A quickly growing Texas-based
  distributor of electronics products offered 240 mln dlrs
  for Crazy Eddie Inc &lt;crzy>, the leading New York City
  electronics retailer, or one dlr per share more than its
  founder has bid.
      The 8-dlr-a-share offer by Entertainment Marketing Inc &lt;em>
  for Crazy Eddie comes less than two weeks after founder Eddie
  Antar and a firm controlled by the Belzbergs of Canada
  announced a bid to take the 32-store Crazy Eddie chain private.
      Analysts said Entertainment Marketing, whose revenues and
  profits quadrupled in 1986, may be looking to break into the
  highly competitive New York City retail market for consumer
  electronics, the nation's biggest, at a time the fortunes of
  electronics retailers have sagged.
      The analysts questioned whether Houston-based Entertainment
  Marketing, founded by a former electronics retailer but whose
  present buinesses are primarily as wholesale distributors, had
  the management expertise for retailing or was merely trying to
  drive up the price of the Crazy Eddie shares it already owns.
      "I have mixed feelings," said analyst Dennis Telzrow of
  Eppler, Geurin and Turner, a Dallas brokerage. "On the one hand
  it's probably a cheap price. On the other hand, does
  Entertainment Marketing have the management talent to run it
  and will the Crazy Eddie people leave?"
      "It's a risky strategy for Entertainment Marketing," said
  analyst Eliot Laurence of Wessels Arnold and Henderson, a
  Minneapolis brokerage. "Electronics retailing is very management
  concentrated; they'd want to keep Crazy Eddie's management in
  place."
      Laurence said that, since Entertainment Marketing already
  owns 4.3 percent of Crazy Eddie's 31.3 million shares, it may
  be trying to get the Antar-Belzberg group to increase its
  7-dlr-a-share offer.
      Shares of Crazy Eddie, which have jumped from the high
  4-dlr range to above 7 dlrs since the Antar-Belzberg bid was
  announced May 20, rose another 50 cents Monday to 8.375 a share
  in over-the- counter trading. 
      Antar, the reclusive founder of the chain in the New York
  City, Philadelphia and Connecticut areas, said last month that
  his group controlled 14 percent of Crazy Eddie's shares.
      A Crazy Eddie spokesman said the company's board has taken
  no decision on the Antar-Belzberg offer, worth some 187 mln dlrs
  since they own more shares than Entertainment Marketing. He
  would not comment on the new offer.
      Entertainment Marketing sells computer products such as
  disk drives and other, often discounted electronics goods to
  retailers, primarily in the southwest, and directly to
  consumers by cable television.
      In fiscal 1986, ending last January, its revenues rose to
  87.9 mln dlrs from 21.3 mln dlrs the previous year. Net profit
  went to 3.2 mln dlrs from 750,000 dlrs in 1985.
      Entertainment Marketing, whose chief executive officer,
  Elias Zinn, once ran an electronics retailing business, said in
  a statement it had committed 50 mln dlrs toward the purchase
  of Crazy Eddie and had retained Dean Witter Reynolds Inc to
  assist in financing the balance.
      Analyst Telzerow estimated that the company would have to
  borrow about 100 mln dlrs to complete the proposed buyout since
  Crazy Eddie has cash and other assets worth about the same
  amount.
      Shares of Entertainment Marketing were up 12.5 cents Monday
  to 9.50.
