ITC CONTESTS USE OF DOCUMENTS AS COURT EVIDENCE
  The International Tin Council, ITC,
  intervened in a High Court hearing in an attempt to prevent the
  presentation of internal Council documents as evidence.
      The intervention in Shearson Lehman's action against the
  London Metal Exchange over its "ring out" of tin contracts in
  1986 is likely to have implications for other cases in which
  the Council is involved following the collapse of its buffer
  stock operations in October 1985, ITC delegates said.
      The ITC's case is being presented by Professor Rosalyn
  Higgins and is expected to take a further one or two days next
  week. Court does not sit tomorrow.
      In essence the Council is claiming that its status is
  similar to that of a foreign embassy and that its archives can
  therefore not be used in an English court of law.
      The Council ended its quarterly session today ahead of
  schedule. The meeting had been expected to go on until tomorrow
  when the European Community's legal advisers were due to
  attend, but delegates reviewed the progress of the various
  legal actions today.
      Otherwise, the meeting was occupied with internal
  administrative matters, delegates said.
      The ITC will continue to operate with a reduced staff after
  June 30 following the two year extension of the sixth
  International Tin Agreement.
      As well as dealing with the ongoing litigation, the Council
  will continue with its statistical work and carry out some
  research studies, although staffing in the research department
  is being cut to one from two previously.
      At this week's session the Council elected Philip Sparkes
  of Australia as first vice-chairman for the producing members
  and Heinz Hofer of Switzerland as second vice-chairman for the
  consumers for the year from July 1. Future quarterly sessions
  are scheduled for October 5/7 and December 14/16.
