ECUADOR'S CEPE NAMES NEW HEAD
  The state-run Ecuadorean State Oil
  Corporation (CEPE) has named Jaime Sanchez Valdivieso as its
  new general manager replacing Carlos Romo Leroux, a CEPE
  spokesman said.
      The spokesman told Reuters Sanchez is a 46-year-old civil
  engineer who formerly headed CEPE's administration and finances
  division.
      Romo Leroux resigned last week for "personal and family"
  reasons, the spokesman said.
