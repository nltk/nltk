ALGERIA BUYS 75,000 TONNES EEP WHEAT - TRADE
  Indications are that USDA accepted
  Algeria's bid for 75,000 tonnes of hard red winter wheat, but
  rejected bids for the remaining 225,000 tonnes under its export
  bonus tender, U.S. exporters said.
      USDA accepted Algeria's bid of 94.00 dlrs per tonne, c and
  f, for 50,000 tonnes for Nov 10-25 shipment and 25,000 for Nov
  20-Dec 10, the sources said. It rejected bids for wheat for
  later shipment dates, they said.
