ECUADOR POSTS 71.3 MLN DLR 8-MTH TRADE DEFICIT
  Ecuador posted a trade deficit of 71.3 mln
  dlrs in the first eight months of 1987, compared with a surplus
  of 468.6 mln dlrs in the same period of 1986, central bank
  figures show.
      Ecuador suspended oil exports, which made up 55 pct of the
  value of its total exports in 1986, for five months this year
  after an earthquake in March shattered the country's pipeline.
      The central bank said the value of exports from January to
  August 1987 stood at 1.132 billion dlrs and imports 1.204
  billion dlrs. Net international monetary reserves declined to
  57.5 mln dlrs at end-September from 146.8 mln dlrs at end-
  September 1986.
