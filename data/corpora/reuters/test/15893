SOVIET UNION TO IMPORT MORE GRAIN IN 86/87-USDA
  The U.S. Agriculture Department
  increased its estimate of 1986/87 grain purchases by the Soviet
  Union to 28 mln tonnes, up two mln tonnes from last month.
      In its monthly report on the Soviet grain situation, the
  USDA said imports will be higher than earlier estimated because
  Soviet grain buyers have been actively purchasing in the last
  month.
      USDA said the increased purchasing is "somewhat surprising"
  because of recent higher Soviet crop estimates.
      All of the increase in estimated imports will be in corn,
  USDA said.
      Of the 28 mln tonnes total, 15 mln tonnes will be wheat, 12
  mln tonnes coarse grains, and the remaining one mln tonnes
  miscellaneous grains and pulses, USDA said.
      USDA noted that the Soviet winter grain crop suffered
  through a severe winter and spring field work has been delayed.
      The severe winter "is believed to have resulted in above
  average winter-kill," USDA said.
      Some grain trade analysts have said abnormal winter losses
  maybe one reason why the Soviet Union has been actively buying
  grain recently.
      USDA said Moscow already has purchased over 25 mln tonnes
  grain for delivery in 1986/87, including 14 mln tonnes wheat
  and 12 mln tonnes coarse grain.
