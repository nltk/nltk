DELORS CALLS FOR G-7 MEETING
  European Community Commission
  President Jacques Delors called for a swift convening of a
  meeting of the G-7 countries following the instability in
  today's trading on world money and stock markets.
      He told a press conference here: "G-7 should meet discreetly
  and quickly."
      Delors said if the dollar were to fall further against the
  mark to levels around 1.60, the European Monetary System would
  undergo a "test by fire."
      Delors said the current problems in the markets had been
  caused by excessive growth in financial trading, excessive
  deregulation and the failure of the fundamentals of the world
  economy to adapt themselves quickly enough to changing
  circumstances.
      He said it was "profoundly unjust" to blame it on recent
  increases in West Germany.
