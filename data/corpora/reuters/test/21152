U.S SENATE PANEL VOTES TO LIMIT COUNTY LOAN DROP
  The Senate Agriculture committee voted
  to limit changes in county loan rate differentials starting
  with the 1988 crop as part of a budget deficit reduction
  package.
      The panel also approved measures that could trigger larger
  corn and wheat acreage reduction requirements, increase
  farmer-held reserve storage payments, reduce a potential milk
  support price cut, and require advance deficiency payments for
  producers of major crops.
      A proposal to require imported tropical oils be labeled on
  U.S. food products failed by a 10-8 vote.
