FED SEEN BUYING DOLLARS FOR YEN IN OPEN MARKET
  The Federal Reserve was detected buying
  dollars for yen in the open market as the dollar fell to a
  40-year low of 144.60 yen in nervous late morning trading,
  currency dealers said.
       They said the size of the intervention was relatively
  modest so far but it was a clear indication that the U.S.
  remained committed to the late February Paris currency
  stabilization accord, which was reaffirmed in Washington last
  night.
      A Fed spokeswoman had no comment on the dealer reports.
      The dollar hovered around 144.70 just before midday.
