ACME PRECISION &lt;ACL> BUYOUT BID DROPPED
  Acme Precision Products Inc said a
  management group has withdrawn a six dlr per share leveraged
  buyout offer.
      Acme said the management group dropped its bid due to
  continued weakness in the machine tool industry and in Acme
  Precision's operating results and to the inability of the
  management group to obtain modifications to terms of its
  financing commitment.
      It said, "The effect of these factors led the management
  group to conclude that the six dlr per share price was
  excessive under current conditions."
