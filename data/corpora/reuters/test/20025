JAPAN MONEY GROWTH TO STAY AT 11-12 PCT - OFFICIAL
  Growth in Japan's M-2 plus certificates of
  deposit (CD) money supply in the October to December period is
  not expected to accelerate, but will remain at high levels
  between 11 and 12 pct, a senior Bank of Japan official said.
      The central bank will keep a watch on high growth in
  liquidity because this is a factor that may cause rises in
  prices of goods, he said.
      The September growth of 11.1 pct year on year announced
  earlier today should not be taken as implying that the money
  supply has started to expand very rapidly, he said. In August
  the rate of increase was 11.0 pct.
