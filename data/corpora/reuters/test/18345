ALBERTA SEEDING VIRTUALLY COMPLETE
  Ninety-six pct of Alberta and
  northeastern British Columbia crops have been seeded, about a
  week ahead of the 10 year average, according to the Alberta
  wheat pool report.
      Hard red spring wheat accounts for most acreage with 6.0
  mln estimated for this year, little changed from last year.
  Oats acreage of 1.95 mln is unchanged on last year and barley
  area of 5.9 mln is also similar to last year. Rapeseed planting
  of an estimated 3.24 mln is expected five pct up on 1986. The
  south and south central areas of Alberta lacked moisture with
  germination patchy at best. Growth prospects in northern areas
  are generally in the good to very good range.
     Soil moisture is better in the north central and Peace
  areas, the wheat pool said.
