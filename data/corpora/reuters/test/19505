SAUDI OIL COMPANY GETS NEW ACTING GOVERNOR
  The acting governor of Saudi Arabia's
  state-owned oil company, Petromin, Jamal Hassan Jawa, has
  retired at his own request, oil industry sources said.
      They said Ali Ibrahim Rubaishi, head of organisation
  planning in Petromin, would take over as acting governor.
      Jawa held the post since his predecessor, Abdul-Hadi Taher,
  left in a major oil industry shake up last December.
      The sources said Rubaishi had not been expected to hold the
  post permanently.
      The government removed Taher and Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki
  Yamani from their posts late last year in a move which industry
  sources said was aimed at coming to grips with a buyers' oil
  market.
      The two men had run the Saudi oil industry for more than 20
  years. Industry sources said that despite huge resources, Saudi
  Arabia had been unable to mould an oil marketing strategy tuned
  to the competitive realities of the 1980s glut.
      Hisham Nazer, who replaced Yamani, successfully led an
  OPEC-engineered return to fixed oil prices of 18 dlrs a barrel
  last December.
      Nazer is believed to be reviewing Saudi oil operations
  which could lead to a thorough overhaul in the way Saudi Arabia
  does business, the sources said.
      The sources had said possible candidates for the governor's
  job include Prince Abdul Aziz Ibn Salman Ibn Abdul Aziz, who
  earlier ran a research center at Saudi Arabia's University of
  Petroleum and Minerals, and former Deputy Planning Minister
  Faisal Beshir. They also list Abdulla Bakr, President of the
  University of Petroleum and Minerals, economist Ali Jonahi,
  Ahmed Shinawi, and Zuheir Masoud, director of Jeddah Islamic
  Port.
