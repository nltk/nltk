WEST GERMANY STILL COMMITTED TO LOUVRE ACCORD
  West German government sources said Bonn
  remained committed to the Louvre Accord to stabilise
  currencies, which was struck by leading western democracies in
  Paris last February.
      Over the weekend, U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker
  criticised recent rises in West German short-term interest
  rates and said such developments were not in the spirit of the
  Louvre pact. He said the agreement may have to be re-examined.
      The sources said the West German interest rate rises had to
  be seen in the context of interest rate developments worldwide.
