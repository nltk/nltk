IRAN VOWS REPRISAL FOR U.S. ATTACK ON OIL RIG
  Iran said several people were injured in
  Monday's U.S. Attack on an Iranian offshore oil site and vowed
  retaliation, Tehran radio reported.
      It quoted President Ali Khamenei as saying, "We will

      A broadcast monitored in Nicosia said several civilian
  personnel on the Rashadat oil platforms in the Gulf east of
  Qatar were injured when U.S. Warships bombarded them this
  afternoon. It described damage as "severe."
      Washington said four American frigates shelled and
  destroyed two Iranian platforms at the Rashadat (formerly

      The U.S. Said Iranians used the platforms for military
  pruposes and had fired on an American helicopter from the rigs
  earlier this month.
      Khamenei denied that the platforms had military gear or
  personnel and said the U.S. Attack lacked miltary value.
      "With this move Mr. Reagan has committed a big mistake and
  has definitely increased his problems...
