S. KOREAN WHOLESALE PRICES UP 0.4 PCT IN MAY
  South Korea's wholesale price index, base
  1980, rose 0.4 pct to 127.0 in May after a 1.1 pct rise in
  April and was 1.5 pct higher than in May 1986, the Bank of
  Korea said.
      The May consumer price index, which has the same base, rose
  1.4 pct to 149.1 after a 0.3 pct gain in April, for a
  year-on-year rise of 3.5 pct.
      Wholesale prices rose 2.0 pct in the first five months of
  1986, while consumer prices rose by 3.2 pct. Bank officials
  said the rises were due to a strong yen which made imports of
  Japanese parts, raw and intermediary materials more expensive.
