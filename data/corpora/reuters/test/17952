KUWAITI DINAR RATES FIRM, AID WINDOW OPEN
  Interest rates on Kuwaiti dinar deposits
  held firm in scattered trading despite a Central Bank decision
  to revive limited funding lines, dealers said.
      The Central Bank, which last Tuesday shut a daily aid
  window through which it lent funds of up to one year, reopened
  the facility for three month money, which was available at
  seven pct, they said.
      It offered one month funds at seven pct through swap
  facilities, dealers said.
      Today's Central Bank action, combined with sales of dollars
  by some banks, helped ease a recent credit squeeze engineered
  by the monetary authority to stem a rush for the U.S. Currency
  arising from attractive U.S. Interest rates and Gulf tension,
  dealers said.
      However, as one dealer noted: "The market is still
  unsettled."
      Overnight funds, bid at 20 pct at the outset of business,
  traded up to 30 pct before easing as liquidity dragged offers
  down to 10 pct by the close. Tomorrow-next, for which buy/sell
  quotes started at 30, 20 pct, ended at 14, eight.
      Spot-next was indicated at 8-1/2, seven after opening bids
  of 10. Dealers quoted one-week at eight, seven against an early
  9-1/2, 7-1/2.
      One month rates were at the same level after trade at eight
  then 8-1/2. Dealers quoted three months at seven, 6-3/4 pct and
  six-month to one year funds at seven, six pct. They reported
  offshore offers of overnight at 10, tomorrow-next at eight and
  one year at 6-1/2 pct towards the close.
       The Central Bank fixed its dinar exchange rate steady at
  0.27933/67 to the dollar, against yesterday's 0.27939/73. The
  spot dinar was 0.27930/40.
