U.S COMMERCE DEPT OPPOSES FOREIGN TAKEOVER BAN
  Commerce Undersecretary J. Michael
  Farren opposed language in the trade bill before Congress to
  limit foreign takeovers of U.S. companies.
      "Anything that would serve to have a chilling effect on
  foreign investment is going to cost us jobs and economic
  growth," Farren said before a congressional coittee.
      House and Senate negotiators are ironing out differences in
  trade bills passed by both chambers. Once the negotiators reach
  agreement, the bill will be sent to President Reagan for his
  signature.
