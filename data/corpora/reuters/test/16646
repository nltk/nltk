CANADA'S WILSON HAS NO COMMENT ON DOME (DMP)
  Finance Minister Michael Wilson said it
  was too early to comment on the tax implications of TransCanada
  PipeLines Ltd's 4.3 billion dlr offer for Dome Petroleum Ltd.
      "The specific offer by TransCanada is just in the course of
  being made and we don't have the details of all the elements of
  the proposal," Wilson told the House of Commons daily question
  period.
      Opposition parties were questioning Wilson about a possible
  loss of tax revenue if the takeover was completed because of
  the large tax credits held by Dome.
