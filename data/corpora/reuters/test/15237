USDA TO PROPOSE FOREIGN MEAT INSPECTION RULE
  The U.S. Agriculture Department is
  preparing a proposal that would require all foreign meat
  products to be inspected at their point of arrival in the
  United States, a USDA official said.
      Donald Houston, administrator of USDA's Food Safety and
  Inspection Service, FSIS, told a House Agriculture subcommittee
  USDA was developing a proposed change in regulations that would
  put an end to the current practice of permitting foreign meat
  products to be unloaded at one port and inspected at another
  port.
      Houston said the requirement would be phased in over
  several years to "avoid disruptions and economic hardship."
