TOSHIBA, SHARP RESTRAIN LAP-TOP PC EXPORTS TO EC
  Toshiba Corp &lt;TSBA.T> and Sharp Corp
  &lt;SHRP.T> decided to maintain exports of lap-top personal
  computers to the European Community (EC) at last year's levels,
  despite the halt of shipments to the U.S., Company spokesmen
  told Reuters.
      They said the voluntary restraints were aimed at averting
  EC sanctions urged by European computer makers. The Europeans
  feared Japanese personal computers would flood EC markets after
  Washington imposed 100 pct tariffs last April.
      Toshiba and Sharp together control about 40 pct of the
  personal computer market in the EC, the Sharp spokesman said.
      Toshiba said exports of T1100 and T3100 lap-top computers
  would continue at 5,000 units a month for the time being.
      Sharp said exports to the EC of PC 7000 series lap-top
  personal computers would continue at last year's level of
  12,000 to 16,000 units a year.
      Washington imposed the tariffs because of Japan's alleged
  failure to uphold a 1986 agreement on semiconductor trade.
