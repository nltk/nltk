BRAZIL COCOA EXPORTERS UNLIKELY TO LIMIT SALES
  Brazilian cocoa exporters are not
  likely to follow the example of Cocoa Producers Alliance, CPA,
  members, who may limit sales of the product in an effort to
  boost world prices, trade sources said.
      They said a similar procedure was taken in the past in
  Brazil and that it did not work out according to plans.
      "The cocoa market is completely free. Unlike coffee, which
  is controlled through export registrations, cocoa exporters in
  Brazil operate at their own free will," a trade source said.
      The traders were responding to questions whether they would
  follow the example of CPA members meeting in Yaounde.
      The sources said the Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade
  Department, CACEX, never interferes in the cocoa market by
  rejecting sales that do not meet certain price or shipment
  criteria.
      "The position of local producers is always to negotiate as
  they please. If they buy for ten and sell for eleven and think
  it's a good deal, they are free to go ahead," one source added.
