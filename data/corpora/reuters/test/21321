UK SUGAR FACTORY CLOSES DUE TO SHORTAGE OF BEET
  British Sugar Plc was forced to shut its
  Ipswich sugar factory on Sunday afternoon due to an acute
  shortage of beet supplies, a spokesman said, responding to a
  Reuter inquiry
      Beet supplies have dried up at Ipswich due to a combination
  of very wet weather, which has prevented most farmers in the
  factory's catchment area from harvesting, and last week's
  hurricane which blocked roads.
      The Ipswich factory will remain closed until roads are
  cleared and supplies of beet build up again.
      This is the first time in many years that a factory has
  been closed in mid-campaign, the spokesman added.
      Other factories are continuing to process beet normally,
  but harvesting remains very difficult in most areas.
      Ipswich is one of 13 sugar factories operated by British
  Sugar. It processes in excess of 500,000 tonnes of beet a year
  out of an annual beet crop of around eight mln tonnes.
      Despite the closure of Ipswich and the severe harvesting
  problems in other factory areas, British Sugar is maintaining
  its estimate of sugar production this campaign at around 1.2
  mln tonnes, white value, against 1.34 mln last year, the
  spokesman said.
      British Sugar processes all sugar beet grown in the U.K.
      The sugar beet processing campaign, which began last month,
  is expected to run until the end of January. Sugar factories
  normally work 24 hours a day, seven days a week during the
  campaign.
      As of October 11, 12 pct of the U.K. Sugar crop had been
  harvested, little different to the same stage last year when 13
  pct had been lifted. Since then, however, very wet weather has
  severely restricted beet lifting.
      Harvesting figures for the week to October 18 are not yet
  available.
