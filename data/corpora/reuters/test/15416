MALAYSIA SEEKS 42 BILLION YEN PIPELINE LOAN
  Malaysia has asked Japan for a 42
  billion yen 25-year loan to finance the construction of gas
  pipelines from eastern Trengganu to southern Johor, the
  Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) said.
      OECF's chief representative, Takashi Matsuya, told
  reporters the Japanese Government is appraising the loan.
  Another OECF official told Reuters Japan is likely to approve
  the loan because "it is technically and economically viable."
      If approved, the loan would carry a coupon rate of four
  pct, a grace period of seven years, Matsuya said. It would be
  disbursed over three years, he added.
      The pipeline contruction is the second phase of the
  Peninsular Gas Utilisation Project by Petronas, Malaysia's
  national oil company.
      The first phase was the supply of gas to households in and
  around the eastern oil town of Kertih.
