SOUTH KOREA INCREASES DUTY ON CRUDE IMPORTS
  South Korea has increased its duty on crude
  oil imports to 4.29 dlrs a barrel from 3.29 dlrs, effective
  today, the energy ministry said.
      The duty, to raise funds for special energy projects, was
  adjusted after average crude import prices rose to 16.85 dlrs a
  barrel in April, from 16.65 dlrs in March and 13.08 dlrs in
  April 1986, ministry officials said.
      A separate 24.5 pct import tax on crude oil is unchanged.
