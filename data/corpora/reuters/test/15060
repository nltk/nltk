SCI-MED &lt;SMLS> BOARD AGREES TO BRISTOL&lt;BMY>DEAL
  Sci-Med Life Systems Inc said
  its directors approved a previously proposed agreement of
  merger with Bristol-Myers Co.
      The proposed transaction is subject to completion of a due
  diligence investigation, including a review by Bristol-Myers of
  a patent infringement suit served on Sci-Med by Advanced
  Cardiovascular Systems Inc on March 31, 1987.
      Bristol-Myers has the right to call off the agreement under
  certain circumstances, it said.
      Sci-Med said it continues to believe the patent suit is
  without merit.
