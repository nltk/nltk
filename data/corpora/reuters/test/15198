COLOMBIA BUSINESS ASKED TO DIVERSIFY FROM COFFEE
  A Colombia government trade official has
  urged the business community to aggressively diversify its
  activities and stop relying so heavily on coffee.
      Samuel Alberto Yohai, director of the Foreign Trade
  Institute, INCOMEX, said private businessmen should not become
  what he called "mental hostages" to coffee, traditionally
  Colombia's major export.
      The National Planning Department forecast that in 1987
  coffee will account for only one-third of total exports, or
  about 1.5 billion dlrs, with oil and energy products making up
  another third and non-traditional exports the remainder.
