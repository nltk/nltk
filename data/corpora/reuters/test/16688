NORTHAIR &lt;NRM.TO> OPPOSING NORQUEST &lt;NQRLF> BID
  Northair Mines Ltd
  said it would oppose Nor-Quest Resources Inc's earlier reported
  proposed takeover bid "with every means at its disposal,"
  saying "this attempt at a property grab is an insult to the
  intelligence of our shareholders."
      It said Nor-Quest's offer to swap one Nor-Quest share plus
  one dlr for two Northair shares would seriously dilute
  Northair's equity in its Willa mine in British Columbia.
      "Our company is in sound financial position and production
  financing can be readily arranged when required. We're not
  looking for a partner and if we were, it certainly wouldn't be
  these guys," Northair said.
