EC, U.S. PLAN HIGH-LEVEL TRADE TALKS
  The European Community is willing to
  offer limited concessions to the United States on one of two
  major issues which threaten to poison their trade relations
  next year, an EC commission spokesman said.
      He said the offer would be made at a meeting later this
  month between U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter and EC
  External Relations Commissioner Willy de Clercq.
      EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen told agriculture
  ministers meeting in Luxembourg that the EC is willing to make
  some temporary arrangements to lighten the impact on U.S.
  Exports of an EC plan to ban the sales of meat from animals fed
  with growth hormones, the spokesman said.
      Washington has said it will take trade reprisals if the EC
  proceeds with the ban from January 1 and if European countries
  do not quickly cut back what it sees as unfair subsidies to the
  makers of their Airbus airliner which are harming U.S.
  Manufacturers.
      It claims the hormones ban has no scientific basis and will
  rob it of 130 mln dlrs' worth of exports a year.
      Diplomatic sources said the Yeutter-de Clercq meeting will
  take place in London and will also involve the aerospace
  ministers of France, Britain, West Germany and Spain, the
  countries involved in the Airbus project.
