BANK OF JAPAN INTERVENES IN TOKYO MARKET
  The Bank of Japan intervened just after
  the Tokyo market opened to support the dollar from falling
  below 140.00 yen, dealers said.
      The central bank bought a moderate amount of dollars to
  prevent its decline amid bearish sentiment for the U.S.
  Currency, they said.
      The dollar opened at a record Tokyo low of 140.00 yen
  against 140.70/80 in New York and 141.15 at the close here
  yesterday. The previous Tokyo low was 140.55 yen set on April
  15.
