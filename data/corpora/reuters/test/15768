SPAIN'S FOREIGN RESERVES RISE IN FEBRUARY
  Spain's foreign reserves rose by 905 mln
  dlrs in February to total 17.05 billion dlrs, compared with
  14.11 billion dlrs in February 1986, Bank of Spain figures
  show.
      Under a new accounting system introduced this month,
  Spain's foreign reserves now exclude foreign currency held by
  financial institutions.
      Under the previous system, Spain's foreign reserves would
  have risen by 391 mln dlrs in February, taking into account a
  fall of 514 mln dlrs in financial institutions' foreign
  currency position.
      In January this year, the Central Bank's foreign reserves
  rose by 143 mln dlrs, while financial institutions' foreign
  currency position fell by 118 mln dlrs.
