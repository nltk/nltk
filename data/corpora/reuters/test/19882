U.S. REASSERTS PLANS FOR DETERRENT ROLE IN GULF
  The United States responded to an
  apparent escalation of Iranian rhetoric with continued
  assurances that its expanded military force in the Gulf would
  play purely a deterrent role.
      "I can only emphasize that our role there is deterrent, that
  we're going to be assuring safety for American shipping and
  that that shipping is not related to the war itself," State
  Department spokesman Charles Redman told reporters.
      He was asked about Iranian claims that the United States
  was moving towards the brink of armed conflict with Iran.
      Tehran Radio quoted defence spokesman Ali Akbar Hashemi
  Rafsanjani telling a visiting Nicaraguan delegation yesterday,
  "At the moment the United States is moving towards the brink of
  an armed encounter with us.
      "We are not concerned about this and believe that the U.S.
  Presence in the war will make our nation even more serious. We
  are determined to stand firm and will certainly win."
      The United States disclosed last week it was beefing up its
  Gulf fleet from seven to 10 warships and also sending the
  refurbished battleship Missouri to patrol just outside the
  strategic Strait of Hormuz, entrance to the Gulf.
      The buildup ties in with U.S. Plans to escort Kuwaiti oil
  tankers which have been re-registered to fly the American flag
  and gain naval protection against Iranian attacks.
      Asked about the Iranian rhetoric, White House spokesman
  Marlin Fitzwater said, "We won't have any comment or response to
  the Iranian statements. Our position has been made clear about
  the status of events in the Gulf. We want an end to the war
  with no winners and no losers and any activities or statements
  that tend to prolong the war or increase hostilities are not
  helpful or welcome."
      Redman said he could not independently confirm reports that
  Iran has offered to halt attacks on Gulf shipping.
