INDIA'S ANNUAL INFLATION RATE DROPS MARGINALLY
  The Finance Ministry said India's
  wholesale-price linked inflation rate dropped marginally to 5.3
  pct in all fiscal 1986/87 ended March from 5.8 pct in 1985/86
  and 7.1 pct in 1984/85.
      The average wholesale-price related inflation stood at 5.2
  pct in March this year against 5.1 pct a year ago, the Ministry

  (mainly wheat and rice), fruits and vegetables, edible oils,
  tobacco and fertilisers were costlier in 1986/87.
