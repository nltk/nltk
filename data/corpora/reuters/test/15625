DOLLAR ENDS LOWER IN LACKLUSTRE FRANKFURT
  The dollar drifted down to end one
  pfennig lower after a lacklustre session, held in limits by the
  lack of concrete news from the Group of Seven meeting and
  comments on the edge of the Washington IMF/World Bank meeting.
      Dealers said the communique early in the European morning
  from the G-7 meeting contained no significant new factors and
  although the dollar dipped it generally resisted further
  attempts to push it lower through the day.
      The U.S. Currency ended at 1.8270/80 marks, below
  yesterday's last 1.8365/75.
      Koch said the assessment of the dollar's direction was
  based on a global view, with operators paying most attention to
  comments by finance officials to see how closely they stated
  adherence to international agreements such as those set at the
  Plaza Hotel in 1985 and in Paris on February 22.
      Koch described the wording of the communique from the G-7
  as "soft as wax."
      Bundebank vice-president Helmut Schlesinger told Reuters in
  a telephone interview that the German central bank sees no
  current reason to change monetary course at present.
      Schlesinger was responding to questions following remarks
  yesterday by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler and West
  Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss, which dealers
  said revived some speculation that German interest rate cuts
  may be under consideration.
      German call money was slightly softer today, at around 3.70
  pct after 3.80 yesterday.
      Some dealers said rates on new liquidity injections added
  via Bundesbank securities repurchase agreements may be cut next
  week. Hopes of a cut were dashed on Tuesday with an allocation
  at an unchanged 3.80 pct.
      But speaking of the pact tender rate next week, Schlesinger
  said, "since the central bank council gives its opinion on this
  theme only every 14 days, this is hardly probable."
      Euromark rates scarcely responded to the central bankers
  comments, with six months funds ending unaltered at around
  3-7/8 pct. Eurodollars for the same maturity rose a fractional
  1/16 pct from yesterday to around 6-11/16 pct.
      Sterling dipped to end at 2.952/956 marks after 2.960/965
  last night. The Swiss franc firmed slightly to 120.30/45 marks
  per 100 from 120.25/40, with the yen soaring however to
  1.2570/90 marks per 100 from 1.2515/35 yesterday.
      EMS currencies saw the French franc end unchanged from last
  night at 30.03/06 marks per 100, with the Belgian franc easing
  however to 4.829/831 marks per 100 from 4.831/833.
