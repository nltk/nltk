NATIONAL COMPUTER &lt;NLCS> SEES EARNINGS GROWTH
  National Computer Systems Inc
  expects fiscal year earnings to improve by about 20 pct, the
  company told analysts, although it said the April 30 first
  quarter should show "down earnings and virtually flat
  revenues."
      Chairman Charles Oswald said National Computer has taken
  steps to improve margins. He said revenues are expected to
  increase modestly because of the company's decision to downsize
  its leasing business, nonrecurring revenueslast year from a
  one-time Texas teacher assessment project and the impact of the
  discontinuance of products last year.
      Oswald said National Computer's first quarter results will
  be down as a result of a major financial systems sales last
  year, a higher effective tax rate and the increased number of
  shares outstanding.
      The company said the next three consecutive quarters should
  demonstrate "excellent earnings growth."
