MINNESOTA MAY CONSIDER ANTI-TAKEOVER AMENDMENT
  Minnesota Governor Rudy Perpich is
  considering calling a special legislative session to consider
  amendments to the state's anti-takeover statute, according to
  the governor's office.
      A spokesman for the governor said nothing will be decided
  today, but said the governor will evaluate later whether to
  call a special session in the next few days.
     The governor's office said the possible action was triggered
  by a proposal by Dayton-Hudson Corp &lt;DH>, which has been the
  subject of takeover rumors. A spokesman for the governor said
  the company proposed several amendments to Perpich designed to
  make any takeover attempt in the state
  more difficult.
         
      Dayton-Hudson suggested amendments be passed and instituted
  by next Friday, the spokesperson said.
      Press reports in Minneapolis newspapers this morning quoted
  several legislators as saying they were inclined to support
  legislation that would help Dayton-Hudson, according to a
  governor's spokesperson.
     Senate Majority Leader Roger Moe was quoted as saying he
  would be inclined to support any action that would help the
  company, the spokesperson said.
     Robert Vanasek, the House speaker designate, was quoted in
  the Minneapolis Star and Tribune as saying, "We are taking
  their (Dayton-Hudson) concerns very seriously and we are going
  to do what we can to help."
