BUNDESBANK REPORTED TO HAVE NO PLAN FOR RATE CUT
  Bundesbank Deputy President Helmut
  Schlesinger said the West German central bank had no plan to
  cut its three pct discount rate, Nihon Keizai newspaper
  reported.
      The financial daily quoted Schlesinger as saying in an
  interview that the bank would try to maintain current interest
  rate levels for the time being.
      He also told the newspaper he saw no need for large-scale
  intervention in the foreign exchange market because exchange
  rates are stable.
       Earlier, Schlesinger told a press conference that the
  Bundesbank would continue its policy of maintaining short-term
  interest rates at a low level for currency stability.
      He also said he was satisfied with the current dollar/mark
  exchange rate but added that he was not certain if it was ideal
  for the West German economy.
