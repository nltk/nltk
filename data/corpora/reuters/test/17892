MEES NEWSLETTER SAYS OMAN OFFERS OIL DISCOUNTS
  Oman has granted term crude oil
  customers retroactive discounts from official prices of 30 to
  38 cents per barrel on liftings made during February, March and
  April, the weekly newsletter Middle East Economic Survey (MEES)
  said.
       MEES said the price adjustments, arrived at through
  negotiations between the Omani oil ministry and companies
  concerned, are designed to compensate for the difference
  between market-related prices and the official price of 17.63
  dlrs per barrel adopted by non-OPEC Oman since February.
