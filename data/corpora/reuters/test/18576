JWT GROUP &lt;JWT> GRANTS GOLDEN PARACHUTES
  JWT Group Inc disclosed in a filing
  with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it awarded
  so-called "golden parachutes" to 26 top officers.
      The company said it granted the special bonuses, which take
  effect only if an executive is fired within two years of a
  successful takeover, on June 8.
      It granted 25 of the officials a severance payment of just
  under three times their annual compensation if they are fired
  after a takeover. For chairman Don Johnston, the payment was
  limited to twice his annual compensation.
      JWT approved additional lump-sum payments of one year's
  compensation to an unspecified number of other highly paid
  company officials.
      The company also altered its employee retirement and stock
  incentive plans, to assure continued protection and benefits
  for employees in the event of a hostile takeover.
      The company did not disclose the cost of the changes made
  in the severance, retirement or stock plans.
