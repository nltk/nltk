BONN CONFIDENT OF MAINTAINING CURRENCY STABILITY
  U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker met West
  German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and Bundesbank
  President Karl Otto Poehl in Frankfurt on Monday, a Bonn
  Finance Ministry spokesman said.
      After the meeting the spokesman quoted Stoltenberg as
  saying he was confident that foreign currencies could be
  stabilised at around current levels.
      The meeting came after Baker criticised West Germany for
  increasing short-term money market interest rates. He had said
  the rise was not in line with the spirit of the Louvre accord
  aimed at stabilizing the U.S. dollar last February.
      The meeting had been arranged last week, the spokesman
  said. Baker, Stoltenberg and Poehl had agreed to pursue the
  policies agreed under the Louvre pact with reference to
  currency stability and monetary policy.
      Earlier on Monday the Bundesbnak injected liquidity into
  the West German money market in a move which money market
  dealers interpreted as an attempt by the West German monetary
  authority to curb interest rate rises.
      The spokesman described Monday's talks, which he called
  private, as very positive.
