TAKEOVER SPECULATION LIFTS HUTTON &lt;EFH> SHARES
  E.F. Hutton Group Inc shares rose on
  speculation the company would receive a takeover offer, traders
  said.
      Hutton's stock also was affected by a newspaper report that
  First Boston Corp &lt;FBC> accumulated almost five pct of Hutton's
  stock on behalf of an outside client, traders said. Traders
  said the story, which appeared in USA Today, added speculation
  which began on the street last week. They said there were
  rumors the stock was under accumulation and speculation
  abounded the company would soon receive an offer. A Hutton
  official declined comment. Hutton's stock rose 2-1/4 to 39-3/8.
      Hutton several months ago rejected a buyout offer from
  Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc &lt;SHE>. The newspaper story
  mentioned speculation American Express Co &lt;AXP>, the parent of
  Shearson, was a possible buyer. But traders said the rumors
  today did not name buyers. First Boston officials were not
  immediatley available for comment.
      Prudential Bache analyst Larry Eckenfelder said he doubted
  the speculation about American Express. He said he believed
  Hutton, which is occassionally surrounded by rumors, moved up
  today as a result of the newspaper article. "Hutton is still a
  takeover candidate," said Eckenfelder.
