MALAYSIA ADVISED TO RAISE CRUDE OIL OUTPUT IN 1988
  Malaysia's national oil company,
  Petronas, has advised the government to raise crude oil output
  to 540,000 barrels a day (bpd) in 1988 from a current 500,000
  bpd, a senior company official said.
      "We have the capacity to produce the amount," Rastam Hadi,
  Petronas's Vice-President for Upstream Sector said.
      The government will announce its decision on Friday when it
  unveils the country's budget. Malaysia raised output this month
  to current levels from 420,000 bpd after reviewing the world
  oil market. In May, Malaysia cut output to 420,000 bpd from
  459,000 in response to a call by OPEC to boost prices.
