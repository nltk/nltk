NAKASONE SAYS DOLLAR FALL ONLY TEMPORARY
  Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said the
  dollar's sharp fall against the yen overnight was only
  temporary.
      The dollar dropped sharply in New York after news that Paul
  Volcker would step down as chairman of the U.S. Federal
  Reserve.
      Nakasone told reporters he did not expect U.S. Policy to
  change after Volcker steps down.
