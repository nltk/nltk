PENTAGON HAS NO INFORMATION ON IRAN ATTACK RUMORS
  A U.S. Defense Department spokesman
  said he had no information on London oil and stock market
  rumors that the United States had launched a retaliatory strike
  against Iran for an attack on Friday that damaged a U.S. shi
      "I don't have anything," Major Randy Morger said. "I have no
  information at all."
      President Reagan said on Sunday he had already made a
  decision on the U.S. response to Friday's Iran attack but would
  not say what the decision was.
      Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on Saturday the
  attack on a U.S.-flagged ship in Kuwaiti waters on Friday was
  almost certainly by an Iran Silkworm missile.
      Some of the rumors in the London markets were that the
  United States had launched an offshore strike against Iranian
  missile installations.
