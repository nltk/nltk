RPT - OPPOSITION TO EC OILS TAX INTACT - MINISTER
  A minority group of European
  Community countries strong enough to block the adoption of a
  tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats is still intact after
  the EC Commission proposed changes to its proposals earlier
  today, British agriculture minister John MacGregor told
  journalists.
      He said Britain, West Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark
  continue to oppose the tax after the Commission proposed making
  it temporary and promising compensation to any third countries
  whose exports suffered.
