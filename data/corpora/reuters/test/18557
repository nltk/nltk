FOUR SUGAR CARGOES SOLD TO CHINA YESTERDAY -TRADE
  Four cargoes of raw sugar were sold to
  China yesterday via the London trade to supplement the
  country's current nearby buying programme, traders said.
      The sugar was reported sold at around 160 dlrs a tonne c
  and f for July/August shipment or arrival in September, they
  said.
      Some traders said recent Chinese purchases could total as
  much as 300,000 tonnes, but others, while agreeing a heavy
  volume had been taken, said an amount less than that figure was
  involved.
      China was still believed to be in the market for more
  sugar, traders said.
