USDA CHANGES LOW PROTEIN WHEAT TERMINAL PRICES
  The U.S. Agriculture Department has
  lowered its ASCS terminal prices for low protein hard red
  winter and hard red spring wheat at a number of locations, a
  senior USDA official said.
      USDA reduced the price of hard red winter wheat at Kansas
  City and Texas by six cents, at Minneapolis and Duluth by 32
  cents and at St Louis by nine cents, Ralph Klopfenstein, deputy
  administrator of commodity operations at the Agricultural
  Stabilization and Conservation Service, said.
      The department also lowered the terminal price of hard red
  spring wheat at Minneapolis and Duluth by 32 cents, he said.
      In addition, USDA cut the Pacific Northwest price of hard
  red spring wheat by 31 cents, USDA officials who asked not to
  be identified said.
      The officials said hard red spring wheat prices at Chicago,
  Denver and Toledo were adjusted by about the same amount as at
  Pacific Northwest, Duluth and Minneapolis.
      The price changes should lead to a pickup of PIK and roll
  activity, Klopfenstein said. The price change was decided upon
  last week and will be effective today, he said.
      Klopfenstein also said the department raised the premiums
  on high protein wheat to offset the drop in low protein wheat
  prices, meaning the net price on any wheat commanding a protein
  premium would remain unchanged.
