CHINA INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT RISES IN FIRST QUARTER
  China's industrial output rose 14.1 pct
  in the first quarter of 1987 against the same 1986 period, the
  People's Daily said.
      Its overseas edition said the growth rate, which compares
  with a target of seven pct for the whole of 1987, was "rather
  high" but the base in the first quarter of 1986 was on the low
  side. Industrial output grew 4.4 pct in the first quarter of
  1986.
      It said China's industrial production this year has been
  normal but product quality and efficiency need further
  improvement. It gave no further details.
