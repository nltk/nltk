JAPAN FIRMS TO LAUNCH SALES OF 100 OCTANE GASOLINE
  Japanese oil companies are starting
  campaigns to market 100 octane gasoline to meet growing
  domestic demand for higher quality motor fuel, oil sources
  said.
      Ten companies plan to offer the unleaded gasoline this
  summer, starting with &lt;Idemitsu Kosan Co Ltd> on June 20.
      Showa Shell Sekiyu KK &lt;SHOL.T> introduced its Formula Shell
  98 octane gasoline to the Japanese market in January this year.
      Formula Shell has achieved strong sales in Japan despite a
  higher price than regular octane gasoline, which has prompted
  other oil firms to offer a rival product, the sources said.
      "We have received a good response from consumers of Formula
  Shell in terms of a smoother ride and effective fuel
  consumption," Showa Shell said.
      Shell's product sells for 145 yen per litre, 15 yen higher
  than regular gasoline, and has already achieved a 38 pct share
  of Japan's high octane gasoline market, it said.
      High octane gasoline accounts for 25 pct of Shell's total
  gasoline sales in Japan, it added.
      Idemitsu said it hopes to raise high octane sales to 20 pct
  of its total gasoline sales from about seven pct, immediately
  after the launch of its Idemitsu 100.
      Nippon Oil Co Ltd &lt;NPOL.T> said it will launch its 100
  octane gasoline on July 1, aiming for an increase in high
  octane sales to 20 pct from six pct of its total gasoline
  sales.
      The rush to compete for high octane gasoline market share
  has been spurred by expectations that the government will lift
  gasoline production quotas and restrictions on gasoline station
  construction in the next two to three years.
      "Major oil companies are trying to boost their gasoline
  sales network ahead of the proposed lifting of gasoline
  production quotas," an official at a major oil company said.
      An advisory panel to the Ministry of International Trade
  and Industry (MITI) recommended this week that the government
  press ahead with deregulation of the oil industry, including
  the lifting of gasoline production quotas, to help oil
  companies increase their international competitiveness.
      Japan's three biggest gasoline marketers, Nippon Oil,
  Idemitsu and Showa Shell, suffered supply shortages under the
  production quota guideline in fiscal 1986, ended last March.
      Domestic gasoline demand during the year was up 2.5 pct
  from the previous year, according to a MITI report.
