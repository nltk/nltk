DIVERSIFIED INDUSTRIES (DMC) TO SELL UNITS
  Diversified Industries Inc plans to
  recover more than four mln dlrs from the sale of two marginal
  subsidiaries, chairman Ben Fixman told the annual meeting.
      Fixman said Diversified Industries, as part of its effort
  to redeploy assets, wants to sell its Theodore Sall Inc and
  Liberty Smelting Works (1962) Ltd units. The two either lost
  money or had marginal profitability in recent years, he said.
      Diversified also said it is in the process of obtaining six
  mln dlrs in an industrial revenue bond financing from the State
  of Connecticut to modernize the company's Plume and Atwood
  Brass Mill plant in Thomaston, Conn.
