MCGRAW-HILL &lt;MHP> DIVESTS SOUTH AFRICAN UNIT
  McGraw-Hill Inc said it has sold its
  McGraw-Hill Book Co South Africa Pty Ltd subsidiary to a local
  management group for an undisclosed amount of cash and halted
  the sale of all products and services to South Africa.
      The company said the divestiture follows a resolution of
  its board in February that cited increased political and social
  unrest within South Africa and the refusal of the South African
  government to abolish the apartheid system.
