FED ADDS RESERVES VIA CUSTOMER REPURCHASES
  The Federal Reserve entered the U.S.
  Government securities market to arrange 1.5 billion dlrs of
  customer repurchase agreements, a Fed spokesman said.
      Dealers said Federal funds were trading at 6-1/2 pct when
  the Fed began its temporary and indirect supply of reserves to
  the banking system.
      Most had expected the Fed to supply reserves directly via
  System repurchase agreements or to add them indirectly through
  two billion dlrs or more of customer repurchase agreements.
  Some believe the Fed is adding fewer reserves than are needed
  to keep upward pressure on rates and so help the dollar.
