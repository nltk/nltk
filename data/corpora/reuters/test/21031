REAGAN CALLS FOR VIGILANCE ON CERTAIN EXPORTS
  President Reagan said the Commerce
  Department should be vigilant in preventing the flow of
  strategic technology from reaching the the Soviet Union and
  other communist countries.
      He was speaking at the swearing in of C. William Verity as
  Secretary of the Commerce Department.
      Verity said the U.S. should make certain that militarily
  sensitive high technology does not wind up in communist
  nations. But he also said the U.S. must reduce the list of
  products of a nontechnological nature, thereby allowing
  manufacturers to increase exports and jobs.
