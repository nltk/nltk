THAI TRADERS PLAN MAIZE FUTURES MARKET
  Thai traders plan to establish a company
  to regulate maize forward trading, in what could be a first
  step towards a commodities futures exchange, maize dealers
  said.
      Traders and Internal Trade Department officials agreed last
  week to commission a study on a structure to regulate maize
  forward trading and to set up a company, Thailand Commodity
  Exchange Co Ltd, with 30 businesses as shareholders who will
  act as brokers in the futures market.
      Chanthong Pattamapong, a commodities trader asked to to
  draw up the study, said if the maize futures market succeeds it
  may be extended to other commodities, perhaps sugar and rubber.
