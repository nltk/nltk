CONT'L MATERIALS &lt;CUO> ENDS CONSIDERATION OF BID
  Continental Materials Corp said its
  directors decided not to give further consideration to
  "business combination" proposed by a stockholder group that
  holds 5.2 pct of Continental Materials stock.
      Continental Materials said the offer had been received from
  Continental Associates, a group of St. Louis businessmen.    
  According to Continental Materials, the group said May 11 it
  might boost its stake in Continental Materials. But the group
  also said in a letter last week to the company that the group
  had no financing. The board "did not consider it an official
  offer," a Continental Materials spokeswoman said.
