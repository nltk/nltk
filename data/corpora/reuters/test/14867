GERMAN INDUSTRIAL EMPLOYMENT SEEN STAGNATING
  The number of workers employed in
  the West German industrial sector stagnated in the last quarter
  of 1986 as a 50,000 increase in overall employment benefited
  only the services branch, the DIW economic institute said.
      A DIW report added the general downturn in the economy
  since last Autumn had had a negative effect on the willingness
  of firms to take on workers. It referred to a marked downturn
  in the number of workers taken on in the capital goods sector.
      New orders for manufacturing industry goods have mostly
  fallen or stagnated in recent months, but data for February
  finally showed a reversal of the trend, with a 1.9 pct rise.
