AUSTRALIAN FOREIGN SHIP BAN ENDS BUT NSW PORTS HIT
  Tug crews in New South Wales (NSW),
  Victoria and Western Australia yesterday lifted their ban on
  foreign-flag ships carrying containers but NSW ports are still
  being disrupted by a separate dispute, shipping sources said.
      The ban, imposed a week ago over a pay claim, had prevented
  the movement in or out of port of nearly 20 vessels, they said.
      The pay dispute went before a hearing of the Arbitration
  Commission today.
      Meanwhile, disruption began today to cargo handling in the
  ports of Sydney, Newcastle and Port Kembla, they said.
      The industrial action at the NSW ports is part of the week
  of action called by the NSW Trades and Labour Council to
  protest changes to the state's workers' compensation laws.
      The shipping sources said the various port unions appear to
  be taking it in turn to work for a short time at the start of
  each shift and then to walk off.
      Cargo handling in the ports has been disrupted, with
  container movements most affected, but has not stopped
  altogether, they said.
      They said they could not say how long the disruption will
  go on and what effect it will have on shipping movements.
