INDONESIA FINDS NEW OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS RESOURCES
  The Indonesian state-owned oil company
  Pertamina has found new offshore oil and gas resources in East
  Aceh, on the western tip of northern Sumatra, a company
  spokesman said.
      The spokesman said the discovery was made at the GOS IA-1
  offshore exploratory well about 38 kms east of Langsa in Aceh.
      "Oil and gas are found in sand layers at the depth of 2,300
  metres within the Baong formation," he said.
      He said preliminary tests showed that the well could flow
  oil at the rate of 1,320 barrels a day with 50 degrees API at
  20 degrees centigrade through a 5/8 inch choke.
      "The well also flows natural gas at the rate of 12 mln
  standard cubic feet a day," he added.
      GOS IA-1 well, located at a water depth of 41 metres, was
  drilled under a production sharing contract between Pertamina
  and Japex North Sumatra Ltd, each having 50 pct shares.
      "Petroleum operations are to be carried out by Pertamina as
  operator through a joint operating body established by the two
  companies," the Pertamina spokesman stated.
      The contract covers the Gebang block contract area. The two
  companies have previously completed the drilling of GOS IIA-1
  exploratory well, around 14 kms south of GOS IA-1.
