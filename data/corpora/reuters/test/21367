STUDY SAYS PORK LEANER THAN USDA FIGURES SHOW
  An Iowa State University study showed
  pork contains considerably less fat than indicated by
  long-established U.S. Department of Agriculture statistics, the
  National Pork Producers Council (NPPC) said.
      Six of the seven muscle cuts evaluated in the study
  averaged 4.3 pct fat or less, well below American Heart
  Association guidelines for recommended foods. Eighty pct of all
  the raw boneless rib chops evaluated in the study contained
  less than six pct fat, the NPPC said.
      Meanwhile, USDA Handbook 8-10 - long used as the
  established authority on nutrient composition, indicates a fat
  content for center loin pork of 7.3 pct, the NPPC said.
      Robin Kline, a dietitian and Director of Consumer Affairs
  for the NPPC said he was not surprised at the wide discrepancy
  between the study and the USDA handbook.
      "Handbook 8-10 is based to a certain extent on information
  that has been accumulated over the past 30 years. The
  statistics in it about pork do not reflect the hog of today
  which is about 50 pct leaner than it was 20 or 30 years ago,
  thanks to genetic improvements and better feeding practices,"
  Kline said.
      The study, funded by NPPC with producer checkoff money,
  evaluated pork carcasses from 47 Iowa producers in categories
  from 0.7 to 1.3 inches of backfat. Researchers measured the fat
  content of the seven muscles before cooking, and the fat,
  moisture and tenderness of cooked boneless rib chops.
