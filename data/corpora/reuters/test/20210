CIRCLE EXPRESS&lt;CEXX.O> ENDS OVERLAND&lt;OVER.O> BUY
  Circle Express Inc said negotiations
  on its proposed acquisitions of Overland Express Inc and
  privately-held Continental Training Services Inc have been
  terminated by mutual agreement.
      The company said the recent declines in stock prices have
  made it unlikely that the transactions could qualify as
  tax-free reorganizations.
