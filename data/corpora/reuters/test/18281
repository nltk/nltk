CCC CREDIT GUARANTEES TO HAITI AMENDED
  The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC)
  has amended its Export Credit Guarantee Program line to Haiti
  to add one mln dlrs in guarantees for sales of U.S. wood
  products, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
      The action increases the value of export credit guarantees
  for wood products to Haiti from 1.8 to 2.8  mln dlrs and the
  total value of export credit guarantees authorized to Haiti for
  the current fiscal year for all commodities to 12.0 mln dlrs,
  the department said.
      All sales must be registered and exports completed by Sept
