SINGAPORE PETROLEUM CO REVISES PETROL PUMP PRICES
  Singapore Petroleum Co Pte Ltd will
  revise pump prices of petrol from June 2, an official said.
      Grade 97 octane with 0.15 gm/lead will be 96.8 cents/litre
  against 94 cents previously for 0.4 gm lead. Grade 92 octane
  will be 90.6 cents against 87.6 previously.
      SPC's price revision follows the Ministry of Trade and
  Industry's move to liberalise petrol pricing by allowing oil
  companies to set their own pump prices.
      New grades of petrol with lower lead content are sold in
  Singapore from today in line with the Ministry of Environment's
  regulations.
