AUSTRALIAN CRUDE OUTPUT FALLS IN FIRST NINE MONTHS
  Australian crude oil and condensate
  output fell 7.6 pct to 23,480 megalitres, or about 147 mln
  barrels, in the first nine months of fiscal 1986/87 ending June
  30, the Department of Resources and Energy said.
      The decline in production in the nine months to end-March
  reflected mainly a sharp dip early in the fiscal year, when low
  oil prices and high marginal excise rates led to a reduction of
  output from Bass Strait, department figures in its Major Energy
  Statistics publication show.
      A megalitre is 6,290 barrels.
