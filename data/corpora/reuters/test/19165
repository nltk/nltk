GHANA LIFTS RICE/MAIZE IMPORT BAN DUE TO DROUGHT
  Ghana has lifted a ban on rice and maize
  imports due to crop problems caused by unusually dry weather,
  the official Ghana News Agency (GNA) reported today.
      Secretary for Finance and Economic Planning Kwesi Botchwey
  made the announcement last night while accepting 7,891 tonnes
  of rice worth about four mln dlrs under a Japanese food aid
  programme.
      The lifting of the ban, imposed earlier this year, follows
  government concern over "lower than average rainfall in southern
  Ghana and its implications for the major harvest."
      Botchwey said rain has been lacking in major cereal growing
  areas throughout the south this year. The Ministry of
  Agriculture has predicted a fall of at least 25 pct in all
  major staple crops including maize, rice and cassava.
      GNA quoted Botchwey as saying that while the consequences
  of current reduced rainfall will be nowhere near the drought
  experiences of 1982/83 the government has taken steps to
  alleviate anticipated food production shortfalls.
      The failure of seasonal rains has already seriously
  affected drinking water supplies, farming and fishing in parts
  of the Central and Volta regions of Ghana where rivers have
  dried up.
