BANK OF JAPAN BUYS DOLLARS IN TOKYO, DEALERS SAY
  The Bank of Japan bought a modest amount
  of dollars at around 145.10 yen just after the market here
  opened, dealers said.
      Just before the opening, the dollar dropped swiftly as
  speculators concluded the Group of Seven (G-7) comminuique
  issued in Washington contained nothing basically new, they
  said. It fell about a half yen, to around 145.
      The G-7 reaffirmed that their currencies around current
  levels reflect economic fundamentals.
      One dealer said the Bank of Japan probably intervened in
  Australia before the opening here, but could not confirm this.
