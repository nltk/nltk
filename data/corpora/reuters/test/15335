HBO &lt;HBOC> URGES SHAREHOLDERS AGAINST ANDOVER
  HBO and Co said it sent a letter of
  strongly urging shareholders not to sign any proxy cards sent
  by Andover Group.
      ON March 30, Andover Group, a two-man general partnership
  which owns about seven pct of HBO's stock, filed preliminary
  proxy materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission
  seeking to nominate an alternative slate of directors at the
  company's April 30 annual meeting.
      Andover had expressed an interest to acquire the company in
  September 1986 but HBO has never received an offer from them,
  it said.
      In addition, HBO said its financial condition is improving
  rapidly as the result of a significant restructuring
  implemented in 1986.
      It expects the company to report net income of about 40 cts
  per share in 1987 and a very significant increase in 1988.
      For the year ended December 1986, the company reported a
  loss of 3.6 mln dlrs, or 16 cts per share.
