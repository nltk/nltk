BARNETT BANKS &lt;BBF> FILES AGAINST FEDERAL BOARD
  Barnett Banks Inc and Home
  Federal Bank of Florida said they filed a suit against the
  Federal Home Loan Bank Board and the Federal Savings and Loan
  Insurance Corp.
      The companies said the suit asks a Jacksonville, Fla.,
  federal district court to enjoin the enforcement of an
  interpretive rule adopted by the FHLBB last year which seeks to
  give it jurisdiction over Barnett's proposed acquisition of
  Home.
      The suit says this rule is arbitrary and capricious.
