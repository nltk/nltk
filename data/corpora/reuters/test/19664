EXXON &lt;XON> EXTENDS MID-GRADE UNLEADED MARKETING
  Exxon Co U.S.A. said it is extending
  marketing of its mid-grade unleaded gasoline, Exxon Plus, into
  the Houston and Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan areas beginning
  early next month.
      Exxon Corp's domestic subsidiary is already marketing the
  89-octane unleaded gasoline along much of the East Coast.
      As it introduces the third unleaded grade, Exxon noted, it
  no longer offers a leaded gasoline in the market, except in
  some rural areas where leaded gaosline will be made available
  to distributors who have a substantial need for the product to
  serve customers whose equipment was designed for leaded fuel.
