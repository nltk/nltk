  purchase of the bank as part of an ongoing review of methods to
  enhance shareholder value.

  1986 year end assets of about 733 mln dlrs.
      "There is no assurance the bank will receive acceptable
  offers or be sold, but we feel this is a prudent step to take
  at this time," the bank said.
