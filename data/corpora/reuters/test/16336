NCR &lt;NCR> CONTINUES TO EXPECT EARNINGS GROWTH
  NCR Corp, earlier reporting higher
  first quarter profit, said it continues to expect that it will
  report record earnings and revenue for all of 1987.
      "Our optimism is based on our incoming order rates and the
  strength of our product lines," the company said.
      NCR Corp plans additional new product announcements this
  year, it said without elaborating.
      NCR earlier said first quarter profit increased to 61.5 mln
  dlrs or 65 cts share from 50.2 mln dlrs or 51 cts share in the
  prior year. NCR's 1986 full-year earnings rose to 336.5 mln
  dlrs from 315.2 mln dlrs in the prior year.
      NCR said the increase in first quarter profit resulted from
  strong revenue growth, which was particularly strong in Europe
  and Pacific marketing groups.
      Growth in U.S. revenues also improved, the company said.
  First quarter revenues increased to 1.12 billion dlrs from
  960.8 mln dlrs in the prior year.
      NCR's U.S. dollar value of 1987 first quarter worldwide
  incoming orders posted a very substantial gain over the prior
  year first quarter, NCR also said without giving specific
  figures. Order growth was broad based across NCR's product
  lines, with the greatest growth coming from U.S., it said.
