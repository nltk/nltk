XEBEC &lt;XEBC> TO REPORT 2ND QTR LOSS
  Xebec Corp said it expects to
  report a loss for its second quarter ended April three, due
  principally to a decline in sales to International Business
  Machines Corp &lt;IBM>, the company's largest customer.
      Xebec also said it expects revenues to total about 23 mln
  dlrs.
      The company reported a second quarter loss last year of 1.9
  mln dlrs, or 14 cts per share, on 23.9 mln in revenues.
      Xebec said IBM has historically accounted for about 50 pct
  of the company's revenues, but that total fell to 20 pct during
  the quarter just ended.
      IBM had used Xebec's hard disk drive controller products in
  the IBM PC/XT, a product which IBM is phasing out.
      Xebec said it intends to continue streamlining its
  operations in light of the loss of business.
      The company also said it has already consolidated two of
  its plants in Nevada and it now plans to sell unused and
  surplus assets to provide additional liquidity.
