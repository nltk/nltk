USAIR &lt;U> SAYS DOT PUBLIC COUNSEL BACKS MERGER
  USAir Group Inc said the U.S.
  Department of Transportation's Office of Public Counsel has
  urged that expedited non-hearing procedures be used in its
  proposed acquisition of Piedmont Aviation Inc &lt;PIE>.
      The company said that America West Airlines Inc &lt;AWAL.O>
  was the only party voicing opposition to the acquisition.  The
  Department of Transportation had asked parties to submit
  statements by June 17 either supporting or opposing the
  acquisition.
      USAir said it and Piedmont again requested expedited
  approval for the acquisition.
      The company said the Office of Public Counsel could find no
  evidence that the acquisition would substantially lessen
  competition in any market.
