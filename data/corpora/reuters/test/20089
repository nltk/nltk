STOLTENBERG DOES NOT RULE OUT INTERVENTION
  West German Finance Minister Gerhard
  Stoltenberg said he could not rule out the possibility of
  central bank intervention to support currencies.
      Asked at a news conference whether central banks were
  prepared to intervene to defend currencies, he said "We cannot
  rule out the use of any instrument which leads to foreign
  currency stability."
      However, he added that in the end, it was market forces
  which prevailed.
