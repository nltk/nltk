AMERICAN CENTURY &lt;ACT> RESTATES EARNINGS
  American Century Corp said it
  has restated its earnings for the fiscal year ended June 30,
  1986 to provide an additional five mln dlrs to its loan loss
  allowance, causing a restated year-end net loss of 14,937,000
  dlrs, instead of 9,937,000 dlrs.
      The company said the change came after talks with the
  Securities and Exchange Commission on the company's judgement
  in considering the five mln dlrs collectible.
      In the note to its 1986 financial statement, American
  Century said it considered the five mln dlrs collectible,
  making its loan loss provision less than required.
      The company said in spite of the SEC decision, it still
  feels its allowance for possible loan losses at June 30, 1986
  was adequate and that it has considered all relevant
  information to determine the collectibility of the five mln dlr
  receivable.
      But, it said continued disagreement with the SEC staff
  would not be in its best interest.
