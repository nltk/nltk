HENLEY &lt;HENG.O> HAS VENEZUELAN REFINERY PROJECT
  Henley Group Inc's M.W. Kellogg Co
  subsidiary said it in consortium with &lt;Inelectra> received a
  contract from Corpoven S.A., a Venezuelan-owned domestic oil
  company, to revamp and expand its El Palito Refinery.
      Kellogg said the installed cost of the work to be performed
  is estimated to be 130 mln dlrs. Inelectra, Kellogg said, is a
  major Venezuelan engineering firm.
     Kellog said the project will enable the refinery to produce
  BTX products -- benzene, toluene, and orthoxylene -- by
  processing naphtha feed from an expanded reformer-hydrotreater.
      Kellogg said the refinery's reformer-hydrotreater will be
  upgraded to 9,500 barrels a day capacity from 7,500.
      It said the new BTX process units include aromatic
  extraction, xylene fractionation, xylene isomerization and
  thermal hydrodealkylation.
      Kellogg pointed out that Venezuela now imports all of its
  BTX aromatics.
