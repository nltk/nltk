AEGON EXPECTS MODERATE RISE IN 1987 PROFITS
  Dutch insurer AEGON NV &lt;AEGN.AS>
  reported a 6.4 pct increase in 1986 net profits to 327.1 mln
  guilders and said it expected a moderate increase in profits
  for 1987.
      Total revenue was eight pct lower in 1986 at 7.97 billion
  guilders vs 8.7 billion guilders in 1985. The company said its
  revenues were down due to lower foreign exchange rates and a
  change in accounting practice. It added that revenues would
  have risen by about seven pct had those changes not occurred.
      Revenue from Dutch operations rose five pct in 1986, mainly
  due to its life insurance business.
      Health insurance revenues in the Netherlands also rose
  despite a notable shift to insurances with lower premiums and
  higher personal risks.
      Damage insurances made losses, mainly due to car damage
  insurances. AEGON did not specify the loss.
      In the United States, revenue in guilders from health and
  life insurance was lower. AEGON said this was due to a change
  in accounting for U.S. Annuities.
      AEGON said annuities are subject to such strong personal
  investment influences that it should be accounted differently
  from the more traditional insurances.
      This change in accounting practice and another change to
  account for profits made on fixed interest investments,
  resulted in an incidental rise in net profits of 31 mln
  guilders.
      AEGON said incidental negative influences on net profits
  were slightly higher, being the lower dollar rate, high initial
  costs for new products, and the cost of new headquarters in The
  Hague.
      In 1986, a large number of new insurance products emerged
  in the Netherlands and the U.S., AEGON said. Large initial
  costs for these products have depressed net profits somewhat.
      Monumental Corp, a U.S. Insurer which merged with AEGON in
  May 1986, saw its profits almost completely eroded by these
  costs and made only a small contribution to the group's
  profits.
      AEGON said it has written-off 657 mln guilders in goodwill
  for Monumental Corp.
      AEGON's net equity was 2.71 billion guilders in December
  1986, against 3.46 billion the year before.
