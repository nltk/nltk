CRAZY EDDIE &lt;CRCY.O> WON'T OPPOSE SLATE
  Crazy Eddie Inc said its board will
  not oppose the slate of nominees proposed for election to the
  board by the committee led by Entertainment Marketing Inc &lt;EM>
  and the &lt;Oppenheimer-Palmieri Fund, LP.>
      Crazy Eddie said its board is not endorsing, but will
  simply refrain from opposing, the EMI-Palmieri nominees.    
  The board also said it will ask representatives of the
  Committee to Restore Shareholder value to begin acquainting
  themselves with the business and affairs of the company as
  promptly as possible.
     
      To that end, the committee's representatives will be
  invited in advance of the annual meeting to examine the
  company's financial records, to monitor its operations and to
  join company officers in meetings with the company's suppliers,
  bankers and key personnel, Crazy Eddie said.
      The board said that to continue to oppose the EMI-Palmieri
  group would only increase the expenses of the company, create
  further uncertainty among its suppliers, customers and
  employees, and result in deterioration of moral among company
  personnel.
      A further release from the company will follow, it said.
