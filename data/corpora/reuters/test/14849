BUNDESBANK ALLOCATES 6.1 BILLION MARKS IN TENDER
  The Bundesbank accepted bids for 6.1
  billion marks at today's tender for a 28-day securities
  repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80 pct, a central bank
  spokesman said.
      Banks, which bid for a total 12.2 billion marks liquidity,
  will be credited with the funds allocated today and must buy
  back securities pledged on May 6.
      Some 14.9 billion marks will drain from the market today as
  an earlier pact expires, so the Bundesbank is effectively
  withdrawing a net 8.1 billion marks from the market with
  today's allocation.
      A Bundesbank spokesman said in answer to enquiries that the
  withdrawal of funds did not reflect a tightening of credit
  policy, but was to be seen in the context of plentiful
  liquidity in the banking system.
      Banks held an average 59.3 billion marks at the Bundesbank
  over the first six days of the month, well clear of the likely
  April minimum reserve requirement of 51 billion marks.
      The Bundesbank spokesman noted that by bidding only 12.2
  billion marks, below the outgoing 14.9 billion, banks
  themselves had shown they felt they had plenty of liquidity.
      Dealers said the Bundesbank is keen to prevent too much
  liquidity accruing in the market, as that would blunt the
  effectiveness of the security repurchase agreement, its main
  open-market instrument for steering market interest rates. Two
  further pacts are likely this month over the next two weeks.
      The Bundesbank is currently steering call money between 3.6
  and 3.8 pct, although short-term fluctuations outside that
  range are possible, dealers said.
