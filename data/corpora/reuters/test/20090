IRAN SAYS U.S. RAID CAUSED 500 MLN DLRS DAMAGE
  U.S. Attacks on two Iranian oil platforms
  in the Gulf -- both of which were still blazing -- caused
  damage estimated at 500 mln dlrs, Tehran Radio quoted Iranian
  Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh as saying.
      The rigs, one of which was heavily shelled by four American
  destroyers on Monday, were still burning almost 24 hours after
  the attack and could cause widespread pollution in the Gulf,
  the minister told a news conference in Tehran. He said the
  Reshadat rigs, 120 miles (200 km) east of Bahrain in
  international waters, were in the final stages of
  reconstruction after an attack by Iraqi jets last year.
