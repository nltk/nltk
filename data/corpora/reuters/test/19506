UAE OIL MINISTER OTEIBA VISITS EGYPT - AGENCY
  UAE Oil Minister Mana Said al-Oteiba
  arrived in Alexandria last night for a visit to Egypt, the
  national Middle East News Agency (MENA) said.
      It said Oteiba, who had just attended the OPEC ministerial
  meeting in Vienna, would stay for several days but gave no
  details.
      Non-OPEC Egypt has pledged to restrain output to support
  OPEC's moves to boost oil prices. Oil Minister Abdel Hadi
  Kandeel last week said Egypt plans to leave its oil production
  of 870,000 barrels per day unchanged for the next five years.
  Egypt is able to produce up to one mln bpd.
