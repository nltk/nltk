BANK OF FRANCE SEES PICKUP IN INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY
  The Bank of France said in its latest
  monthly report on the French economy it expected a pickup in
  industrial production registered in March to gather steam over
  the next few months.
      Without giving figures, the report said last month's rise,
  partly linked to efforts to catch up with production lost
  earlier this year through industrial action, was due mainly to
  a firming of domestic demand.
      "New progress is expected in all main sectors except capital
  goods where production will remain at its present level," the
  report added.
      The upbeat report comes in the wake of grim March trade
  balance figures which showed a deficit in industrial trade for
  the first time since June 1982.
      While the automobile industry remained unchanged from
  previously boosted levels, consumer goods production grew and
  was expected to accelerate except in the area of domestic
  appliances. Semi-finished goods showed a clear increase in all
  sectors. Construction and civil engineering, boosted by a rise
  in public works, also improved, while retail trade sales in all
  sectors continued to slow.
