BURLINGTON &lt;BUR> HEARING TO CONTINUE TOMORROW
  U.S. District Court Judge Eugene
  A. Gordon said he plans to issue a decision tomorrow on
  Burlington Industries Inc's request for an injunction to stop
  Samjens Acquisition Corp's takeover bid for the company.
      Wall Street sources have said the outcome of the case could
  be pivotal in determining the winner in the fierce takeover
  battle for Burlington, the largest u.s. textile maker.
      Gordon presided over six hours of argument today by lawyers
  for Burlington and Samjens, a partnership formed by Dominion
  Textile Inc and New York investor Asher Edelman.
      Hearings are scheduled to continue tomorrow. A preliminary
  injunction would hold up Samjens 2.47 billion dlr offer until
  the case is decided.
      Burlington had previously agreed to a 2.44 billion dlr
  buyout from Morgan Stanley Group Inc &lt;MS>, one dlr per share
  lower than a sweetened 77 dlr per share bid made by Samjens
  last week. Burlington has not responded to the new Samjens
  offer.
      Burlington has alleged in its lawsuit that Edelman and
  Dominion used illegally obtained confidential information about
  the company in making their takeover attempt.
   
      That information, Burlington said, was provided by James
  Ammeen, a former Burlington executive, through PaineWebber
  Group Inc &lt;PWJ>. Ammeen, who had worked for Burlington for 23
  years, had as many as 12 divisions with 50 pct of Burlington's
  sales reporting to him. When he left Burlington in November,
  1985, Burlington said he signed a contract promising never to
  divulge inside information about the company.
      Burlington lawyers said shortly after he left he began
  working with a PaineWebber employee on a hostile plan to
  "takeover the company, dismember the company and displace its
  management," Burlington lawyer Hubert Humphrey said.
      Samjens lawyers acknowledged it received information from
  PaineWebber, but argued the information was public information
  and could be obtained either from texitle industry analysts or
  Burlington's public financial statements.
      Burlington lawyers said PaineWebber and Ammeen met with
  Edelman and Dominion in November and continued to meet with
  them until a couple of days before Edelman and Dominion went
  public April 24 with their intention to take over the company.
  Burlington lawyers claim Dominion's board decided to attempt a
  takeover of Burlington after Ammeen met with the board in
  February.
      Burlington lawyers said Edelman and Dominion held
  discussions with PaineWebber and Ammeen about acting as
  financial advisers to Samjens. But they allege talks broke off
  because Painewebber and Ammeen could not satisfy Edelman and
  dominion with a written statement that they did not provide
  inside information.
      Lawyers for Samjens contended that Painewebber and Ammeen
  withdrew as potential advisers because Burlington chairman
  Frank Greenberg had called a PaineWebber executive and
  threatened legal action if PaineWebber got involved in an
  effort to takeover Burlilgnton.
      "The ultimate question is not the price per share or the
  profit, but rather the permissable standards of conduct for
  those who would takeover an American company," said burlington
  lawyer Humphrey.
      Burlington lawyers also contended that Burlington, as the
  largest manufacturer of denim in the United States, would be in
  violation of anti-trust laws if it acquired Dominion, Canada's
  largest textile maker. Dominion has denim manufacturing plants
  in Georgia, which would reduce competition in the denim market,
  the lawyers said.
      Samjens' lawyers discounted the concern. They said the
  market for denim is more fragmented than Burlington contends
  and that Burlington has the ability to switch between light
  weight and heavy weight denim production as demand and price
  dictate.
      Samjens lawyers also pointed to a lawsuit filed by
  Burlington in Canada, in which it said it was considering a bid
  for Dominion. "Surely, what would have been sauce for the goose
  would have been sauce for the gander," said Sidney Rosdeitcher,
  a Samjens lawyer.
