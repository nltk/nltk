U.S. MILITARY LEADER PREDICTS IRANIAN RESPONSE
  William Crowe, chairman of the U.S.
  Joint Chiefs of Staff, predicted Iran will retaliate for the
  U.S. strike against its oil platform though he said Iranian
  options were limited.
      "They will be determined. They will not be easily deterred,
  and let me stress for you that our commitment there is not
  going to be risk free or casualty free."
      He said the most likely Iranian response would involve
  terrorism or the laying of mines.
      "They obviously will look for ways that are probably more in
  line with the 'silent hand' than what they have tried thus far,"
  Crowe told an American Stock Exchange conference.
      He declined comment on a reporter's query whether he
  favored a stronger move against Iran than that ordered by the
  president.
      "We carried out the operation that was decided upon and we
  carried it out with enthusiasm and I think it was
  professionally and well done," Crowe said.
