MIYAZAWA SAYS G-7 STILL SUPPORTS LOUVRE ACCORD
  Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa
  said the Group of Seven (G-7) nations still support the Louvre
  Accord to stabilise currencies.
      He also told a news conference following a cabinet meeting
  that the Group of Five (G-5) and G-7 do not have any plans to
  meet for talks.
      The Finance Minister further said that overseas stock
  market plunges will not lead to a freefall in the Tokyo stock
  market. "There is no special worry about the stock market in
  Tokyo," he added.
      Miyazawa said the Tokyo stock market should not be gravely
  affected by the downturns of markets in New York and London
  because there is a clear sign of an economic recovery in Japan
  and stability of exchange rates.
      Asked if the U.S. Had contacted Japan after the stock
  market plunge in New York, Miyazawa said there was not any
  contact.
