INDONESIA SAYS IT WILL EXTEND OIL CONTRACTS
  Indonesia told the oil industry on
  Tuesday it will extend contracts on producing blocks and
  improve the investment climate, but wants to see increased
  expenditure on exploration in return.
      President Suharto, in an opening speech to the Indonesian
  Petroleum Association, said Indonesia was ready to extend
  contracts held by foreign oil companies on producing areas.
      "In order to boost investment in the petroleum industry, the
  government of Indonesia has basically approved of extending
  production sharing contracts under the present laws," Suharto
  said.
      "Apart from that, the government will keep improving the
  investment climate in order to accelerate the development of
  the petroleum industry," he said.
      Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto told the Association he
  was aware that the oil industry needed to be assured that
  contracts on blocks expiring within the next 10 years would be
  renewed before they would invest in further exploration.
      "As we all have heard this morning, the President is fully
  aware of this situation," Subroto said.
      "The government has already made the political decision to
  entertain this time problem by inviting the existing producers
  to continue their activities in Indonesia, albeit on a
  selective basis."
      Indonesia, one of the 13 members of OPEC, must find new oil
  reserves if it is to remain an exporter in the next decade, oil
  industry sources say.
      Subroto said the government was also working to ease other
  problems, including granting easier terms for remote areas or
  deep water conditions.
      But Subroto said relations with oil companies were two-way
  and that they should step up expenditure on oil exploration now
  that the oil price had recovered.
      President Suharto said he wanted to see greater transfer of
  technology to Indonesian companies, and more help from the oil
  industry for the regions in which companies operated.
      Abdul Rachman Ramly, the President of state oil company
  Pertamina, has said that budgeted exploration and production
  expenditure for all oil companies in Indonesia was forecast to
  fall to 3.1 billion dlrs in calendar 1987 from 3.4 billion in
  1986.
      Pertamina has 69 production-sharing or joint operation
  contracts with foreign oil companies.
      Subroto said speeding up necessary approvals for field
  operations was a government priority. There had been
  misunderstandings between the government and the oil industry
  in certain areas, such as when a field is designated
  commercial, and a thorough evaluation was being made.
      He said the government wanted to finalise contract
  extensions as soon as practical, and urged the industry in the
  meantime to maintain its exploration drive.
      Subroto said Indonesia needed the companies to maintain
  exploration efforts, even if their contract was due to expire
  within 10 years. "This need in itself is some sort of guarantee
  that we will soon have to come up with an extension agreement."
      Eleven major contract areas are due to come up for renewal
  between 1991 and 2001, industry sources said.
      Extension of the contracts on the blocks has involved
  detailed negotiations but so far no extension has been granted.
      Subroto told reporters afterwards that contract extensions
  would be selective, based on how much capital would be
  invested.
