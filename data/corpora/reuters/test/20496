LAWSON SAYS U.S.-WEST GERMAN ROW WAS UNNECESSARY
  U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
  Lawson said the recent dispute between the United States and
  West Germany over economic policy was responsible for much
  financial turmoil and that it should never have happened.
      He said in a television interview the dispute had fanned
  fears of a breakdown in the cooperation which is so important
  between finance ministers of the major nations.
      He said the dispute was a row which should not have
  happened and agreed that much of the blame lay with U.S.
  Treasury Secretary James Baker who had publicly criticised West
  Germany for having raised its key interest rates.
