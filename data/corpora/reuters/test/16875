HOSPITAL CORP &lt;HCA> BOARD AGAINST BUYOUT BID
  Hospital Corp of America said
  its management believes the 47 dlr per share acquisition offer
  it received from Charles R. Miller, Richard E. Ragsdale and
  Richard L. Scott is not in the best interest of shareholders,
  and it does not plan to meet with the individuals.
      The company said its board considered information on the
  three and their bid, and "Given the lack of any demonstrated
  ability on the part of these individuals to consummate an
  acquisition of this magnitude, the board decided it was not
  necessary to take any action on their proposal at this time."
      Hospital Corp said "The benefits of the company's ongoing
  repositioning program are already being realized, and we will
  continue to explore appropriate alternatives for enhancing
  shareholder value."
