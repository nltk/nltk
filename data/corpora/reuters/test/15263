  first quarter results were significantly higher due to the

  performances in plastics, major appliances and the Employers

  1.18 dlrs per share for the same quarter a year ago.

  company's outlook for 1987 in which it expects double-digit GE
  earnings growth for the year. He said the first quarter results
  are in line with those expectations.
      General Electric cited the strong results in TV network and
  station operations of the National Broadcasting Co, which was
  not part of GE in the first quarter of 1986, as one reason for
  its strong earnings.
      It also noted that aircraft engine operating profit was
  much higher than a year ago, caused by a increase in shipments
  than the 1986 quarter, which was impacted by a strike.
      Aerospace revenues were sharply higher in this year's first
  quarter from a year ago, mainly because of the inclusion of
  RCA's aerospace and defense business, the company said.
      In addition, consumer products revenues were up from last
  year, mainly because of including sales of RCA video products.
      General Electric said restructuring provisions of 308 mln
  dlrs before taxes to implement various strategic moves were
  charged against operations in the first quarter of 1987. It

  taxes from an inventory accounting change.
