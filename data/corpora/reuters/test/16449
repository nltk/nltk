  Dataproducts Corp said
  it signed a letter of intent to acquire the Imaging Solutions
  Inc unit of Reliance Electric Co under undisclosed terms.

  solid and liquid ink technologies which had been developed by a
  joint venture operated by it and Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, Dataproducts

  Systems Inc, had been a Reliance Electric Co subsidiary.
