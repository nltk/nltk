SCRAP CREPE RUBBER PRICES FIRAT COLOMBO AUCTION
  Scrap crepe prices firmed on good
  shortcovering demand at the Colombo rubber auction, brokers
  said.
      One-X brown was traded at 19.75 rupees per kg, up 15 cents
  from last rates while other grades also showed improvements.
  The rise was attributed to a shortage of rubber available to
  manufacture this type.

  selling at 20.92 rupees. Crepe one was traded at 20.68 and
  crepe two at 20.45 rupees.
