LYNG SAYS INDIA FOOD AID PACKAGE NOT READY
  The United States and India have
  not yet agreed on a food aid package to help the
  drought-stricken Asian country, Agriculture Secretary Richard
  Lyng said.
      Lyng told Reuters in an interview that the two countries
  have been discussing a package but that he did not expect the
  specifics of the offer to be announced during Indian Prime
  Minister Rajiv Gandhi's visit here this week.
      "We have been talking about the potential needs that India
  might have for both their commercial market and purchases needs
  as well as the possibilities of assistance," Lyng said.
      "At this point, there is no detailed plan or program. The
  amounts of what commodities are uncertain. But we have
  indicated to the Indians that we stand ready to assist in
  whatever way they deem most valuable," he said.
      There has been speculation in trade circles that USDA would
  offer India subsidized vegetable oil under the export
  enhancement program and donate surplus corn under Section 419
  of an amended 1949 law.
      Lyng indicated the two countries have been unable to agree
  on the mix of concessional and commercial aid, and that
  Washington would prefer the package include something other
  than donated food.
      "The Indians are capable of purchasing a lot, of taking care
  of themselves. India is a country that has come a long way in
  its ability to produce food and they have a great pride in
  that," Lyng said.
      "We (the United States) obviously, with the surpluses we
  still have of many commodities..., would like to share in the
  import business the Indians do, and then we have some, as we
  always do, compassion for the people of India and would like to
  cooperate with them," he said.
      Lyng said he had no plans to meet with Indian officials
  during Gandhi's visit here, adding, "I just don't know of
  anything that might be announced specifically."
      Asked if "the ball was in the Indians' court," he said, "Yes."
      Gandhi is to leave Washington Tuesday evening.
