DAUSTER SAYS CONSUMERS SHOULD KEEP OUT OF QUOTAS
  Consumer countries should not
  intervene in the distribution of coffee export quotas,
  Brazilian Coffee Institute president Jorio Dauster said.
      "Distribution of export quotas should be in the hands of
  producers as has been traditional," Dauster, a delegate at the
  recent coffee symposium here, told journalists. "When consumers
  want to get involved, talks are much more difficult."
      The main consumer country the United States and main
  producer Brazil failed to reach agreement on quota distribution
  when the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) met in
  February.
      Dauster said Brazil's role when the ICO meets in London in
  September will be to support the world coffee pact, defend its
  market share and argue for distribution of quotas to be in the
  hands of producer countries.
      "We have sacrificed a great deal already," he said. "this year
  we have a crop of 35 mln bags, we have economic problems and we
  are not in a position to do favours."
