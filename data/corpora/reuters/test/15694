FRANCE'S BALLADUR SAYS TARGET ZONE NOTION NEARER
  French Finance Minister Edouard
  Balladur said that the financial community is closer to
  arriving at a system of target zones for currencies despite the
  fact that little is being said about them.
      Speaking with reporters at the semiannual meetings of the
  International Monetary Fund, Balladur said, "We are not very far
  from the notion of target zones, even if we don't say so."
      He told reporters that "our ideas are progressing," adding
  that the finance ministers have been talking about more
  cooperation on economic policies and on levels around which
  currencies should stabilize.
