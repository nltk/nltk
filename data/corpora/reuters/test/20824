EDELMAN GROUP COMMITTED TO TELEX &lt;TC> BID
  TLX Partners, a group led by Asher
  Edelman, does not see any problems with its 65 dlr per share
  bid for Telex Corp, a Shearson Lehman official advising the
  group said.
      Several other takeover proposals have crumbled following
  declines in financial markets, leading to speculation that
  Edelman might also drop his offer. Telex fell 11 to 34-1/4.
      Earlier today, Carl Icahn dropped his bid to take Trans
  World Airlines Inc &lt;TWA> private and Dart Group Corp &lt;DARTA.O>
  said it abandoned plans to acquire Dayton Hudson Corp &lt;DH>.
      Both cited market conditions.
      "Nothing fundamental has changed with the company. The
  stock price has changed, but the company hasn't changed so
  there's no reason for us to change," said Daniel Good, head of
  Shearson Lehman merchant banking.
      "Things are proceeding as planned, and we fully expect that
  at the time we have to pay for the shares the financing will be
  in place," Good said.
      Shearson has agreed to provide bridge financing of up to 
  600 mln dlrs for the Edelman group.
