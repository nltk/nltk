BELGIAN CURRENT ACCOUNT SURPLUS WIDENS IN 1986
  Belgium's current account surplus,
  measured on a cash basis, widened sharply to 134.9 billion
  francs last year from 17.5 billion in 1985, the Finance
  Ministry said.
      The increase was due almost entirely to a sharp rise in the
  goods trade surplus to 126.1 billion francs from 20.4 billion.
      The services trade surpluses increased to 52.4 billion
  francs from 38.9 billion while the deficit on transfers rose
  slightly to 43.6 billion from 41.8 billion.
      Private sector capital operations showed a steeply higher
  deficit of 160.7 billion francs after 56.9 billion in 1985.
