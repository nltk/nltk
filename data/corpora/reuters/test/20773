DART GROUP DROPS DAYTON HUDSON &lt;DH> TAKEOVER BID
  Dart Group Corp &lt;DARTA.O> affiliate
  Madison Partners said that given current market conditions it
  has dropped its takeover bid for Dayton Hudson Corp.
      The company said it sold 1.4 mln of its 4.6 mln shares of
  Dayton Hudson stock.
      It said it intends to sell the rest of its Dayton Hudson
  shares. At current market levels, it would suffer a 70 mln dlr
  aftertax loss on its holding, a spokesman said.
      Dart said it will not solicit authorization to call a
  meeting of Dayton Hudson shareholders.
      Dart had offered to buy Dayton Hudson for 68 dlrs per
  share, valuing the Minneapolis based retailer at 6.6 billion
  dlrs. That offer was rejected by the company.
      Following the selloff in takeover stocks last week, and the
  market's decline this week, Dayton Hudson stock closed at
  27-1/2 today, off 2-1/2.
      Dart's holdings amounted to just under five pct of Dayton
  Hudson.
      A Dart spokesman said the 1.4 mln shares were sold in the
  market today.
