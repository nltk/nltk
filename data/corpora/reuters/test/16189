JAPAN CENTRAL BANK ACTIVELY BUYS DOLLARS IN TOKYO
  The Bank of Japan actively bought dollars
  here in early afternoon trade at around 142.20 yen, dealers
  said.
      The central bank had placed buy orders at that level and
  prevented the dollar from falling when it came under heavy
  selling pressure from investment trusts and trading houses,
  they said.
      However, the intervention failed to boost the U.S. Currency
  significantly from the 142.20 yen level, they added.
      The dollar was trading around its midday rate of 142.30
  yen. It had opened here at 141.85 yen.
