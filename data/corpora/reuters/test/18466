CHINA MOVES TO STABILISE WORLD TUNGSTEN PRICES
  China is moving to stabilise world prices
  of tungsten after fluctuating prices this year affected the
  country's export earnings, the China Daily said.
      The paper quoted industry officials as saying they would
  fix export prices on the basis of the world market, stop
  smuggling and encourage producers to reduce exports.
      Current world prices range from 49 to 55 dlrs per tonne
  unit, but China suffered heavy losses when the price slumped to
  39 dlrs earlier this year, it said.
      Some 45 pct of world tungsten exports come from China, but
  the country imports high-grade tungsten products.
