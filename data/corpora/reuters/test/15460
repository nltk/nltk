EUROPEAN MARKETS REACT QUIETLY TO G-7 COMMUNIQUE
  European currency markets reacted quietly
  to the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealers
  ranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete to
  surprise that the markets should have expected so much.
      The dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies
  and traded in a narrow range after the communique, which
  reaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currency
  stabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it.
      Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remaining
  broadly entrenched in its current trading range.
      "The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84
  marks," said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase Bank
  AG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs.
      However, she said the dollar could break out of the range
  with major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S.
  Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.
      Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd
  in Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against
  the mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen,
  possibly to 140 yen.
      A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expects
  a dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.
      London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb
  underlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative
  sentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank
  operators to test the downside.
      Concern that finance ministers and officials still in
  Washington could issue more concrete statements in favour of
  currency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with
  worries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the
  long term, the traders said.
      Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the
  communique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar's
  downward trend.
      Traders in several centres said the market would look for
  fresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to
  defend current ranges, which the communique said were "broadly
  consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy
  intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting."
      Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said
  "They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon." The
  U.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.
      However, some dealers said London-based operators would be
  unlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long
  Easter weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825
  marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.
      Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said
  the G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable
  market for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme
  volatility seen in the first few months of this year.
      One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the
  communique made clear the leading nations did not want a
  further dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.
      The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to
  1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre
  accord's supposed currency target range.
      A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were
  ready for a period of "mainly sideways movement."
      But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique
  contributing to greater stability.
      "Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big
  boost," said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he
  expects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks
  in the next three months.
