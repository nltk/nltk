TOTAL PETROLEUM &lt;TPN> SHUTS TEXAS PIPELINES
  Total Petroleum NA &lt;TPN> shut down
  several small crude oil pipelines operating near the
  Texas/Oklahoma border last Friday as a precaution against
  damage from local flooding, according to Gary Zollinger,
  manager of operations.
      Total shut a 12-inch line that runs across the Ouachita
  River from Wynnewood to Ardmore with a capacity of 62,000 bpd
  as well as several smaller pipelines a few inches wide with
  capacities of several thousand bpd or less, Zollinger said.
      The Basin Pipeline, a major pipeline running 300,000 bpd,
  run by a consortium of other oil companies, was closed today.
      One other small pipeline that Total also closed has a
  capacity of 3,000 to 4,000 bpd and crosses the Red River in
  Fargo, Texas, Zollinger said.
      He said the closed pipelines run under river water and
  could be damaged as the flooded rivers erode the river banks
  and expose the piping.
      Zollinger said Total is waiting for the river waters to
  recede before they reactivate the pipelines.
