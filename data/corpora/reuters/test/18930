REYNOLDS METALS TO RESTART IDLE POTLINE
  Reynolds Metals Co said it plans
  to restart the last idle potline at its Troutdale, Ore.,
  primary aluminum plant.
      With the restart of this 22,700 tonne a year production
  line, Reynolds said it will be operating at 100 pct of its
  consolidated primary aluminum capacity of 695,000 tonnes per
  year.
      Reynolds said work on the restart will begin in the near
  future and it is expected that actual metal production will
  begin September 1.
      The company said the start-up was necessitated by
  continuing strong demand for aluminum and dwindling worldwide
  inventories, and that the metal is needed to supply Reynolds'
  various fabricating businesses.
