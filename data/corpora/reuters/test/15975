USDA COMMENTS ON EXPORT SALES REPORT 
  U.S. corn sales of just over 1.0 mln
  tonnes in the week ended April 2 were eight pct above the prior
  week, but 25 pct below the four-week average, the U.S.
  Agriculture Department said.
      In comments on its latest Export Sales Report, the
  department said Iraq, Japan and the USSR were the largest
  buyers.
      Sales for the next marketing year, which begins September
  1, totaled 503,200 tonnes and were mainly to Iraq and Taiwan.
      Wheat sales of 119,300 tonnes for the current season and
  net reductions of 13,700 tonnes for the 1987/88 season were
  four-fifths below the combined total for the prior week and the
  four-week average, it said.
      Sri Lanka was the most active wheat destination with
  purchases of 52,500 tonnes for the current year, it said.
      Other significant purchasers for the current year were
  Mexico and Honduras, it said.
      Soybean sales of 240,500 tonnes were one-fifth below the
  prior week and nearly one-third below the four-week average.
      Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Italy and Israel were the major
  purchasers, the department said.
      Net sales of 117,700 tonnes of soybean cake and meal fell
  31 pct from the previous week and 38 pct below the four-week
  average. Major increases for West Germany, Venezuela, the
  Netherlands and Saudi Arabia were partially offset by
  reductions for unknown destinations, USDA said.
      Activity in soybean oil resulted in decreases of 2,400
  tonnes, with sales to unknown destinations down by 2,700
  tonnes, while sales to Canada increased 200 tonnes, the
  Department said.
      Combined sales of 71,300 running bales of cotton -- 60,200

  season -- were four-fifths higher than the prior week's level
  but nine pct below the four-week average.
      Mexico was the dominant buyer for the current year followed
  by Zaire, Italy, and Spain, the department said.
  The primary buyers for the 1987/88 season were South Korea,
  Spain, Japan and Taiwan, the department said.
      Sorghum sales of 143,300 tonnes were 25 pct less than the
  prior week, with Japan and Venezuela the main buyers.
