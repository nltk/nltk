U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN 53 MLN STG ASSISTANCE
  The Bank of England said it provided the
  money market with 53 mln stg assistance in the morning session.
      This compares with the bank's estimate of a shortage in the
  system of around 300 mln stg which it earlier revised up from
  250 mln.
      The central bank made outright purchases of bank bills
  comprising 46 mln stg in band three at 9-3/4 pct and seven mln
  stg in band four at 9-11/16 pct.
