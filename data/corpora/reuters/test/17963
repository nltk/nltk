SAUDI ARABIA OPPOSES DRASTIC CHANGE IN OIL PRICE
  Saudi Arabia's Oil Minister Hisham Nazer
  said Riyadh would not agree to a cut in oil prices and would
  not accept a "mad" increase that would drive consumers away.
      He told al-Riyadh newspaper, "Saudi Arabia follows a
  balanced petroleum policy. It does not approve of a decrease in
  prices from current levels and it also does not accept a mad
  increase that would drive consumers away and make them try and
  find alternative sources (for energy)."
      OPEC agreed last December to cut production after world
  prices hit new lows in 1986. They agreed on a pricing system
  aimed to stabilize the market around 18 dlrs a barrel.
  
      OPEC is scheduled to meet in Vienna on June 25, where it
  will review its current oil price and production policy.
      Saudi Arabia's King Fahd said last month that he wanted oil
  prices to remain stable for the next two years.
      Saudi Arabia is the architect of the current pricing and
  production pact, which is backed by Kuwait and the UAE. The
  current pact set a production ceiling for first half 1987 of
  15.8 mln bpd, and implemented fixed prices based on an 18 dlrs
  a barrel average.
