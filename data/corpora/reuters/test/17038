MILD COFFEE GROWERS TO MEET IN GUATEMALA
  A large group of "other milds"
  coffee-growing nations will hold talks in Guatemala next month
  to map their strategy for next September's meeting of the
  International Coffee Organisation (ICO).
      Mario Fernandez, executive director of the Costa Rican
  coffee institute, said delegates from Mexico, the Dominican
  Republic, Peru, Ecuador, India, Papua New Guinea and five
  central american nations will participate in the two-day
  strategy session beginning May 4.
      The main topic will be reform of what many producing
  countries perceive as the ICO's unfair distribution of export
  quotas, Fernandez said.
      He said Costa Rica would press for quotas "based on the
  real production and export potential of each country in the
  past few years" and to distribute quotas based on "historic"
  production levels rather than recent harvests and crop
  estimates.
