FDIC'S SEIDMAN SAYS HIGHER RATES COULD HARM BANKS
  Federal Deposit Insurance Corp Chairman
  William Seidman said he would be concerned about the impact on
  banks of a further sharp rise in interest rates.
      However, Seidman, attending the American Bankers
  Association convention, said he did not expect rates to rise
  much higher and said the outlook for the U.S. economy and for
  banking was sound.
      "The potential for greater interest rate rises gives us
  concern. We see nothing right now in the outlook that causes us
  to believe rates are going much higher or that the economy is
  not sound," Seidman told a news conference.
