DUTCH PARLIAMENT BACKS STAND AGAINST OILS TAX
  Dutch parliamentary parties have
  re-affirmed their support for the government's opposition to
  the proposed European Community tax on oils and fats,
  parliamentarians said.
      A broad cross-section of members of parliament voiced their
  opposition to the tax during a debate in the lower house
  yesterday on the basis of possible retaliation from the U.S.
  And on the potentially damaging effect on Third World
  countries.
      State Secretary for Foreign Affairs Rene Van Der Linden
  said the government was against the tax although it noted
  deepening EC financial difficulties.
      "It is difficult to be against the tax and against extra
  finance. The EC members have to make a choice," Van Der Linden
  said.
      However, he denied the government had dropped its
  opposition to the proposed tax or altered its position.
