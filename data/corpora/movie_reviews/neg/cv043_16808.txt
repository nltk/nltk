 " party camp , " is one of the most mindnumbingly brainless comedies i've seen in awhile . 
a late rip-off of the " meatballs " series , the film follows a group of young camp counselors at camp chipmunk . 
that's really about all that can be said about the " plot " because nothing much happens , except that the main character , wise-cracking jerry ( andrew ross ) , has the hots for a cute blonde ( kerry brennan ) , and there is a big contest in the climax . 
how fun ! 
since , " party camp , " has practically no screenplay and there is no talent at all involved , the least the makers could have done was make it raunchy and exploitative . 
it's not that i think exploitation is necessarily a good quality , but when you are talking about a dull turkey like this , the least that could have been done would be to fill it with a lot of mindless sex . 
even a psychopathic slasher at the camp would have done the trick . 
at least , then , it wouldn't have been such a chore to sit through . 
never before have i seen so many jokes fall astoundingly flat . 
the comedy was easy to spot , but it wasn't the least bit funny . 
it was groan-inducing . 
constantly throghout , i was asking myself if director gary graver actually thought this movie was worth anything . 
so what saves , " party camp , " from the dreaded zero star rating ? 
well , that's simple : jewel shepard , as a flighty bimbo , was admittedly fun to watch . 
although nothing could have saved this film from the lowest depths of motion picture trash , at least if the film had centered on shepard , she might have been able to add a little spice to an otherwise rancid , low-budget teen comedy .
