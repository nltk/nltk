synopsis : big-breasted and dim-witted sculptress britt gets really mad at her grad student boyfriend because he spends too much time on his thought-transference experiments instead of her art showings . 
elderly , evil scientist everett longstreet switches minds with britt's boy , in the meantime , and goes completely mental . 
comments : naked souls opens with a naked woman , and the movie makes no illusion that it's a sci-fi vehicle designed to show pamela anderson's , um , talents . 
if you are really interested in seeing anderson's talents , however , i suggest you skip over this dud and watch the infamous pam and tommy lee honeymoon sex tape , now available on home video . 
at least with that " movie , " you don't have to go through the painful experience of watching pamela try to pronounce multiple syllable words like " eclectic . " 
a premise does exist in the movie . 
basically , while anderson wears skimpy clothes which barely contain her talents , she practices her art -- brilliantly slapping plaster of paris on naked women . 
her boyfriend , meanwhile , spends 20 hours a day in a morgue trying to view the memories of dead prison inmates because this will " make a difference to humanity . " 
whatever . 
the movie fails to explain how these two hooked up . 
be grateful . 
after we meet the evil everett longstreet , lots of technobabble and mystical mumbo-jumbo get tossed about , pammy has sex replete with cheesy make-out music , and minds get transferred . 
never fear , though , pammy uses her sharp mental abilities ( ahem ) to save her boyfriend in the end . 
unfortunately , no one saves the movie . 
avoid this would-be sci-fi thriller , unless you're in for a good laugh or two .
