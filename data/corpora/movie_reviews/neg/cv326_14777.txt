capsule : a wild jungle woman and an 11-story gorilla are discovered in tibet and taken to hong kong where the gorilla escapes and causes havoc . 
this is a laughable 1977 rip off of king kong ( 1976 ) , itself a rip-off . 
production values are low and audiences seem to like the film mostly for derisive laughter . 
 , high -2 ( -4 to +4 ) 
- directed by ho meng-hua . 
- this film is provided to be a sort of laughing stock to finish the festival . 
- an earthquake uncovers an 11-story tall gorilla in the himalayas . 
a hunter , chosen because he just broke up with his girl and is at loose ends , gets sent to find the ape and finds a sort of female tarzan who controls the ape . 
- evelyne kraft is the jungle girl in a leather bikini that she is pasted into so she always looks on the verge of bouncing out of . 
- gorilla actor has no idea how gorillas move and suit is terrible . 
nice miniature effects , however . 
- has almost a music video inside it of jungle girl playing with animals like chi-chi the leopard . 
- several places there is narrative that is nearly incoherent as if there are missing scenes and the viewer has to guess what happened in the interim . 
- actual location shooting in mysore . 
ape shown badly matted behind temple . 
- combining of images usually pretty bad . 
incompetent matching of film stocks . 
- stock footage frequently used . 
- gorilla brought to hong kong by greedy entrepreneur who really abuses the ape before it escapes and tears things up real good .
