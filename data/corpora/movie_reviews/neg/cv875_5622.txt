everything in the phantom you have seen many times before and there is nothing new presented here . 
wincer displays absolutely no skill in setting up an exciting action sequence . 
billy zane is wooden as the hero . 
kristy swanson is given very little to do , and does very little with it . 
treat williams , looking like rhett butler but sounding like mickey mouse , is one of the worst villains i have ever seen in a movie . 
only catherine zeta jones , as one of williams cohorts turns in a good performance . 
she has energy and spunk , which the movie needed much more of . 
oh yeah , the phantom also has a secret identity but this is so poorly played out you won't even care . 
about the only things i can recommend are a good performance by jones , and some colorful scenery . 
however , if youre looking for a fun family movie , go watch the underrated flipper . 
this is not a good movie .
