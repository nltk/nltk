don't let the following quirks of this review , fool you into believing that this movie is anything short of an ultimate labour of love . 
but one can see the humour of roberto benigni when you see that ? 
life is beautiful , even though i'm a short , ugly looking man with an obnoxious laugh . 
life is beautiful even though i haven't amounted to much in life , except working out the finer intricacies of waitering . 
i'm a lucky sort of a guy , especially when a beautiful woman strips away my venner of superficiality to find a new age , sensitive guy with the biggest heart in the entire world underneath - life is beautiful ! 
i'm a jew , but life can still be beautiful . 
the nazis put me in a concentration camp , but life is still beautiful . 
i love my son very much and that's what matters , and that's what makes life beautiful . 
my ability to entertain somehow convinces my son that living in a concentration camp is somewhat beautiful ? 
i get shot for my efforts and the woman i love , but hey that's life and that's still a beautiful thing - so by jove don't give me any crap about it ! 
by far the movie with the biggest heart this decade and well deserves every nomination and award that it has achieved . 
well done , there should be more film directors and actors like you roberto benigni .
