i have seen several ( but not that many ) woody allen movies . 
i didn't particulary like radio days , the purple rose of cairo , play it again , sam . 
i quite enjoyed manhatten murder mystery and everything . . . 
sex , and i loved might aphrodite . 
however i found bullets over broadway to be a snoozing bore . 
and bullets got some very raving reviews , but i didn't think i'd like . 
but i finally saw it ( double feature with ready to wear i think ) and hated it . 
since . . . 
i love you also seems to be getting raving reviews i wasn't sure if i'd want to see . . . 
thankfully i did ! 
people burst into singing and dancing , something i hardly ever like . 
but this movie is so infectious . 
and funny ! 
and entertaining ! 
 ( and unlike evita , they only sing when they need to . ) 
sure some of the actors may not be great singers , but they seems to be having a great time , and so does the audience . 
that's all i have to say . 
really , if you think that is going to be a dull movie , you're probably dead . 
and dead people should not be forced into movie theatres . 
is mark leeper dead ? 
he said that " this is an almost ghastly misfire " . 
the movie is rated r , for * one * use of the word motherf * * * * * .
