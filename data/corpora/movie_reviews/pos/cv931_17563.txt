like the great musical pieces of mozart himself , amadeus is a true work of art . 
it is one of those few movies of the 80's that will be known for its class , its style , and its intelligence . 
why is this such a good film ? 
there are almost too many reasons to explain . 
the story : court composer salieri ( f . 
murray abraham ) feels waves of different emotions going through his head as wolfgang amadeus mozart ( tom hulce ) comes into his life as the young genius composer . 
salieri feels envy , and jealousy , but at the same time is fascinated with mozart's brilliance and ingenious . 
we travel through mozart's life as a composer , through his struggles , his triumphs , and ultimately , his demise . 
the acting : abraham is magnificient as salieri ; his acting range enables him to focus on each individual emotion and express it through his speech and body language . 
this performance earned him a well deserved oscar . 
tom hulce is interesting as well as mozart , a quirky , annoying bratty kid with an annoying laugh . 
he's strong , but weak at the same time , and must be aided by his wife ( elizabeth berridge ) , who is good in her role , but lacks dramatic depth . 
jeffrey jones , in a smaller , more dignified role than such roles in stay tuned and mom and dad save the world , is cast perfectly because of his noble charm . 
the movie : every element of this movie works . 
the costumes and makeup are very memorable , as well as its stunning art direction , and unforgettable scores ( adapted from mozart's original music ) . 
while wolfgang amadeus mozart was a genius at music , milos forman proves with his film that he is a genius of filmmaking . 
this movie is a classic that will be remembered for years to come .
