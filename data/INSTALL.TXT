This directory contains the standard corpus set for NLTK.  Each
corpus or corpus sample is contained in a single zip archive
(e.g. "brown.zip") that unzips to a subdirectory of the same name
(e.g. "brown/").  Each corpus is accompanied by a readme file (e.g.,
"brown.readme") that describes the corpus's contents, copyright, and
license.

Unix Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    1. Create a directory to hold the NLTK corpus set.  Common paths
       for this directory are /usr/lib/nltk; /usr/local/lib/nltk;
       and /usr/share/nltk.  If you are not a system administrator,
       you can put this directory in your home (e.g. ~/nltk_corpora).

           mkdir /usr/lib/nltk

    2. Uncompress each corpus that you'd like to use to into the
       NLTK corpus directory that you created.

           unzip <corpus>.zip -d /usr/lib/nltk

    3. If the NLTK corpus directory that you created is not in
       /usr/lib/nltk, /usr/local/lib/nltk, or /usr/share/nltk, then
       you will need to tell NLTK where to find the corpora.  You can
       do this by setting the NLTK_CORPORA environment variable:

           export NLTK_CORPORA=/usr/lib/nltk_corpora  # for sh or bash
           setenv NLTK_CORPORA /usr/lib/nltk_corpora  # for csh or tcsh

       Alternatively, you can also use the function set_basedir() in
       the module nltk.corpus:

           >>> from nltk.corpus import set_basedir
           >>> set_basedir('/usr/lib/nltk_corpora')

Windows Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    1. Create a folder to hold the NLTK corpus set.  Common names
       for this folder are C:\Program Files\Python2.2\nltk; and
       C:\Program Files\Python2.2\lib\nltk.

    2. Uncompress each corpus that you'd like to use to into the
       NLTK corpus directory that you created.  Typically, this
       is done by copying <corpus>.zip into the NLTK corpus folder
       that you created; and double-clicking on <corpus>.zip.
       However, depending on what tool you use to unzip files,
       the procedure might be slightly different.  If you don't
       already have a tool to unzip files, you can use the WinZip
       <http://www.winzip.com> evaluation version.

    3. If the NLTK corpus folder that you created is not in
       <path-to-python>\nltk or <path-to-python>\lib\nltk, then you
       will need to tell NLTK where to find the corpora.  You can do
       this by setting the NLTK_CORPORA environment variable.  For
       most versions of Windows, this enviroment variable can be set
       with the following procedure:

           1. Right click on "My Computer", and select "Properties."
           2. Select the "Advanced" tab.
           3. Click on "Environment Variables"
           4. Under "User Variables," click "New..."
           5. Type "NLTK_CORPORA" into the "Variable Name" field;
              and type the path to the NLTK corpus folder that you
              created into the "Variable Value" field.
           6. Hit "Ok" (3 times) to close the dialog windows.

Macintosh Installation (OS X)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    1. Create a directory to hold the NLTK corpus set.  A common path
       for this directory is /usr/share/nltk.  If you are not a system
       administrator, you can put this directory in your home
       (e.g. ~/nltk_corpora).

           mkdir /usr/share/nltk

    2. Uncompress each corpus that you'd like to use to into the
       NLTK corpus directory that you created.

           unzip <corpus>.zip -d /usr/share/nltk

    3. If the NLTK corpus directory that you created is not in
       /usr/lib/nltk, /usr/local/lib/nltk, or /usr/share/nltk, then
       you will need to tell NLTK where to find the corpora.  You can
       do this by setting the NLTK_CORPORA environment variable:

           export NLTK_CORPORA=/home/me/nltk  # for sh or bash
           setenv NLTK_CORPORA /home/me/nltk  # for csh or tcsh

       Alternatively, you can also use the function set_basedir() in
       the module nltk.corpus:

           >>> from nltk.corpus import set_basedir
           >>> set_basedir('/home/me/nltk')
