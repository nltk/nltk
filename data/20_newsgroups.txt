20 Newsgroups, by Ken Lang and Jason Rennie
http://www.ai.mit.edu/~jrennie/20Newsgroups/

The 20 Newsgroups data set is a collection of approximately 20,000
newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different
newsgroups [1].  The 20 newsgroups collection has become a popular
data set for experiments in text applications of machine learning
techniques, such as text classification and text clustering.

The data is organized into 20 different newsgroups.  Some are closely
related, while others are completely unrelated.  Here is a list of the
newsgroups:

comp.graphics, comp.os.ms-windows.misc, comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware,
comp.sys.mac.hardware, comp.windows.x, rec.autos, rec.motorcycles,
rec.sport.baseball, rec.sport.hockey, sci.crypt, sci.electronics,
sci.med, sci.space, misc.forsale, talk.politics.misc,
talk.politics.guns, talk.politics.mideast, talk.religion.misc,
alt.atheism, soc.religion.christian

The version of the dataset distributed here is Jason Rennie's, which
has duplicates and headers removed.  It was originally distributed as
a gzipped a tar file: "20news-18828.tar.gz", but is repackaged using
zip for wider accessiblity.  For more information, please see
