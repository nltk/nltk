LICENSE 

Terms and Conditions for Copying, Distributing, and Modifying 

Items other than copying, distributing, and modifying the Content with
which this license was distributed (such as using, etc.) are outside the
scope of this license.

1. You may copy and distribute exact replicas of the OpenContent (OC) as
you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients
of the OC a copy of this License along with the OC. You may at your option
charge a fee for the media and/or handling involved in creating a unique
copy of the OC for use offline, you may at your option offer instructional
support for the OC in exchange for a fee, or you may at your option offer
warranty in exchange for a fee. You may not charge a fee for the OC
itself. You may not charge a fee for the sole service of providing access
to and/or use of the OC via a network (e.g. the Internet), whether it be
via the world wide web, FTP, or any other method.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the OpenContent or any portion of
it, thus forming works based on the Content, and distribute such
modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
also meet all of these conditions:

a) You must cause the modified content to carry prominent notices stating
that you changed it, the exact nature and content of the changes, and the
date of any change.

b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
in part contains or is derived from the OC or any part thereof, to be
licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
this License, unless otherwise permitted under applicable Fair Use law.

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
sections of that work are not derived from the OC, and can be reasonably
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,
and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
whole which is a work based on the OC, the distribution of the whole must
be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees
extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of
who wrote it. Exceptions are made to this requirement to release modified
works free of charge under this license only in compliance with Fair Use
law where applicable.

3. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed
it. However, nothing else grants you permission to copy, distribute or
modify the OC. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept
this License. Therefore, by distributing or translating the OC, or by
deriving works herefrom, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do
so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or
translating the OC.

NO WARRANTY 

4. BECAUSE THE OPENCONTENT (OC) IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE OC, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE OC "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK OF
USE OF THE OC IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE OC PROVE FAULTY, INACCURATE, OR
OTHERWISE UNACCEPTABLE YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY REPAIR OR
CORRECTION.

5. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MIRROR AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE OC AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE OC, EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
