WordNet 1.7.1 data files

WordNet [http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/]
WordNet is an online lexical reference system whose design is inspired by
current psycholinguistic theories of human lexical memory.  English nouns,
verbs, adjectives and adverbs are organized into synonym sets, each
representing one underlying lexical concept.  Different relations link the
synonym sets.
