NLTK -- the Natural Language Toolkit -- is a suite of open source
Python modules, data sets and tutorials supporting research and
development in Natural Language Processing.

Documentation: A substantial amount of documentation about how
to use NLTK, including a textbook and API documention, is
available from the NLTK website: http://www.nltk.org/

  - The book covers a wide range of introductory topics in NLP, and
    shows how to do all the processing tasks using the toolkit.

  - The toolkit's reference documentation describes every module,
    interface, class, method, function, and variable in the toolkit.
    This documentation should be useful to both users and developers.
