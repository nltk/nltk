Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

    NLTK, the Natural Language Toolkit, is a suite of program
    modules, data sets and tutorials supporting research and teaching in
    computational linguistics and natural language processing.

    NLTK is ideally suited to students who are learning NLP (natural
    language processing) or conducting research in NLP or closely
    related areas, including empirical linguistics, cognitive science,
    artificial intelligence, information retrieval, and machine
    learning.  NLTK has been used successfully as a teaching tool, as an
    individual study tool, and as a platform for prototyping and
    building research systems.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    A substantial amount of documentation about how to use NLTK is
    available from the NLTK website: http://nltk.org/

    In particular, the NLTK homepage contains three types of
    documentation:

      - The book teaches students how to use the toolkit, in the
        context of performing specific tasks. They are appropriate for
        anyone who wishes to learn how to use the toolkit.
        http://nltk.org/index.php/Book

      - The toolkit's reference documentation describes every module,
        interface, class, method, function, and variable in the
        toolkit. This documentation should be useful to both users and
        developers.  
        http://nltk.org/doc/api/

Mailing Lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    There are four mailing lists associated with NTLK:
      - nltk-announce: Public information and announcements
        about NLTK (very low volume)
      - nltk-devel: Discussions between NLTK developers
      - nltk-commits: Subversion commit logs for NLTK
      - nltk-teach: Discussions between people teaching courses using NLTK (closed list)
