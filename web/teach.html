  <h1> Teaching with NLTK </h1>
  
  <p> NLTK provides ready-to-use courseware and a flexible framework
  for project work.  Students augment and replace existing components,
  learn structured programming by example, and manipulate
  sophisticated models from the outset.  </p>
  
  <h2> Distributing NLTK to Students </h2>

  <p> NLTK is easy to install; simply refer students to the
  <a href="install.html">installation instructions</a>, or
  distribute CD-ROMs containg NLTK
  (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=30982&package_id=156043">download the ISO image</a>).

  <h2>Tutorials and Exercises</h2>

  <p> NLTK comes with extensive <a href="lite/doc/en/">tutorials</a>,
  including many exercises with a range of difficulties.  You may
  distribute these materials to students, and assign a selection of
  exercises.

  <h2> Assignments and Projects </h2>
  
  <p> NLTK can be used to create student assignments of varying
  difficulty and scope.  

  <!-- Use a module --> In the simplest assignments, students
  experiment with an existing module.  The wide variety of existing
  modules provide many opportunities for creating these simple
  assignments.

  <!-- Edit/extend a module --> Once students become more familiar
  with the toolkit, they can be asked to make minor changes or
  extensions to an existing module.

  <!-- Develop a new module --> A more challenging task is to develop
  a new module.  Here, NLTK provides some useful starting points:
  predefined interfaces and data structures, and existing modules that
  implement the same interface. </p>

  <h2> Demonstrations </h2>
  
  <p> NLTK provides graphical tools that can be used in class
  demonstrations to help explain basic NLP concepts and algorithms.
  These interactive tools can be used to display relevant data
  structures and to show the step-by-step execution of algorithms.
  Both data structures and control flow can be easily modified during
  the demonstration, in response to questions from the class.  Since
  these graphical tools are included with the toolkit, they can also
  be used by students.  This allows students to experiment at home
  with the algorithms that they have seen presented in class. </p>

  <p> See the <a href="getting_started.html">NLTK quick start
  guide</a> for information about how to run the demonstrations. </p>
    
  <h2>Courses using NLTK</h2>

  <p> NLTK was designed for use in CIS-530 at the University of
  Pennsylvania, beginning in 2000, by Edward Loper and Steven Bird.
  It has since been used in courses at many other institutions.</p>

  <p><i>Please let us know if you teach natural language processing
  using NLTK, and we will add your course URL to our list.  We will also
  subscribe you to the NLTK-Teach mailing list, where you can interact
  with others who use NLTK in their teaching.</i> </p>
