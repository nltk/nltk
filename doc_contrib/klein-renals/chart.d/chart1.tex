% Slide 1
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Parsing}


Parsing with a CFG is the task of assigning a correct tree (or
derivation) to a string given some grammar.

A correct tree is:
\begin{itemize}
\item consistent with the grammar, and
\item the leaves of the tree cover all and only the words in the input.
\end{itemize}

There may be a very large number of correct trees for any given input \ldots

\section{Chart Parsing}

\subsection{Overview}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Slide 6
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Dynamic Programming}


Our current algorithm builds valid trees, discards them during
backtracking, then rebuilds them.
\begin{itemize}
\item the subtree for \ling{a flight} was derived 4 times.
\end{itemize}

\Em{Dynamic programming} is one answer to problems that have
sub-problems that get solved again and again

We'll consider an algorithm that fills a table with solutions to
subproblems that:


\begin{itemize}
\item does a parallel top-down search with bottom-up filtering
\item does not do repeated work
\item solves the left-recursion problem
%\item solves an exponential problem in $O(N^3)$ time
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Slide 7
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Dynamic Programming and Parsing}


  \begin{itemize}
    
  \item Systematically fill in tables of solutions to subproblems.
    
    
  \item When complete, the table contains all possible solutions to all of
    the subproblems needed to solve the whole problem
%    compactly encodes all possible solutions to the whole problem.
    
    
  \item For parsing:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item the table stores subtrees for constituents.
    
    
    \item Solves reparsing inefficiencies, because subtrees are not
      reparsed but looked up.
    
    
    \item Solves ambiguity explosions, because the table
      \emph{implicitly} stores all parses.
 
    \item Each subtree is represented only once and shared by all parses
      that need it.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

  \end{itemize}
\item Record incomplete constituents with \Em{dotted rules}:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Dot on the RHS of a rule shows what we\'ve found already:\\
 \VP\ $\rightarrow$ V \,\,\bigdot\,\, \NP
\item We can use this as a label for an incomplete constituent.

\subsection{The Basic Idea}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Slide 8
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Dynamic Programming and Parsing}


The Earley algorithm:

\begin{itemize}
  
\item fills a table (the \Em{chart}) in a single left-to-right pass
  over the input.
\item The chart will be size $N+1$, where $N$ is the number of words in
  the input.
\item Chart entries are associated with the gaps between the
  words --- like slice indexing in Python.

\item For each word position in the sentence, the chart contains a set
  of edges representing the partial parse trees generated so far.

\item So Chart[0] is the set of edges representing the parse before looking at a word.


\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Slide 9
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{States}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item J\&M call the chart entries \Em{states}.
 
\item The chart entries represent three distinct kinds of things:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item completed constituents;
  \item in-progress constituents; and
  \item predicted constituents
  \end{itemize}

  \item The three kinds of states correspond to different dot locations in
    dotted rules:
    \begin{description}
    \item[Completed:] \VP\ $\rightarrow$ V \,\, \NP \,\,\bigdot
  
    \item[In-progress:] \NP\ $\rightarrow$ \Det \,\,\bigdot \,\, \Nom\
  
    \item[Predicted:] \Se\ $\rightarrow$ \bigdot \,\, \VP
    \end{description}

  \end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Slide 10
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{States, cont.}


  \begin{itemize}
    
  \item Given dotted rules like those we've just seen, we need to record:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item where the represented constituent is in the input, and
    \item what its parts are.
    \end{itemize}

  \item So we add a pair of coordinates $[x,y]$ to the state:

\begin{itemize}
  
  \item $A \rightarrow \alpha , \; [x,y] $
  \item $x$ indicates the position in input where the state begins
  \item $y$ indicates position of dot
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\subsection{Example States}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Slide 11
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]

Example states in parsing \ling{Book that flight}:
 
\begin{enum}
  
  \item \Se\ $\rightarrow$\; \bigdot\ \VP, [0,0]

    \begin{itemize}
    \item First 0 indicates that the constituent begins at the start of the
      input.
    \item Second 0 indicates that the dot also begins at start of input, and
      thus indicates a top-down prediction.
    \end{itemize} 

  \item \NP\ $\rightarrow$ \Det\ \bigdot\ \Nom, [1,2]

    \begin{itemize}
    \item the \NP\ begins at position 1
    \item the dot is at position 2
    \item \Det\ has been successfully \ling{completed}
    \item \Nom\ is \Em{predicted} next
    \end{itemize}
  \end{enum}
\end{frame}

    \item \VP\ $\rightarrow$ \V\ \NP\ \bigdot, [0,3]

      \begin{itemize}
      \item \VP\ is \Em{completed}
      \item no further \Em{predictions} from this rule
      \item a successful parse that spans the entire input
      \end{itemize}
    \end{enum}

% Slide 13
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Success}


%As with the Viterbi and Forward algorithms, 
The final answer is found
by looking at the last column of the table. In particular, for an input
of $N$ words, if we
find the following kind of state in the chart then we've succeeded: 
\begin{quote}
  
  \Se\ $\rightarrow \alpha$  \bigdot, [0,N]
\end{quote}

\end{frame}

\section{The Earley Algorithm}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Slide 14
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Parsing}


Parsing is sweeping through the chart creating the three
kinds of states as we go. States are never removed, and
we never backtrack.

\begin{itemize}
  
\item New \emph{predicted} states are based on existing table entries
  (predicted, or in-progress) that predict a certain constituent at that
  spot.
  
\item New \emph{in-progress} states are created by updating older states
  to reflect the fact that previously expected completed constituents
  have been located.
  
\item New \emph{completed} states are created when the dot in an
  in-progress state moves to the end.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Slide 15
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{More Specifically}


  \begin{enum}
  \item Predict all the states you can.
    
  \item Read an input.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item See what predictions you can match.
    \item Extend matched states, add new predictions.
    \item Go to next state (goto 2)
  \end{itemize}

  \item At the end, see if \textit{state\/}$[N+1]$ contains a complete \Se.
\end{enum}

\end{frame}

%\end{document}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Slide 16
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Earley Algorithm}


The Earley algorithm has three main functions that do all the work:
\begin{description}
\item [Predictor:] Adds predictions into the chart
\item [Completer:] Moves the dot to the right when new constituents are
  found
\item [Scanner:] Reads the input words and enters states representing
  those words into the chart
\end{description}

              \prog{Enqueue}(($B \bnfeq \bigdot \gamma, [j,j]$){\ac}\var{chart}[\var{j}])
       \key{end}
}

\begin{itemize}
\item Intuition: new states represent top-down expectations.
\item Applied when a state has a non-terminal to the right of a dot that
  is not a part-of-speech.
\item Generates one new state for each alternative expansion of the
  non-terminal in the grammar.
\item Adds states to the same chart entry as generating state.

              \prog{Enqueue}(($A \bnfeq \alpha B \bigdot \beta, [i,k]$){\ac}\var{chart[k]})
       \key{end}

}

\begin{itemize}
\item Intuition: parser has discovered a constituent, so must find and
  advance states that were looking for this grammatical category at this
  position in input.
\item Applied when dot has reached right end of rule.
\item New states are generated by copying old state and advancing dot
  over expected category.
\item Adds new states to same chart entry as generating state.
\end{itemize}

            \prog{Enqueue}(($B \bnfeq word[j] \bigdot, [j,j+1]$){\ac}\var{chart[j+1]})
}

\begin{itemize}
  
\item New states for predicted part-of-speech.
\item Applicable when part-of-speech is to the right of a dot.
\item Adds states to next chart entry.
\end{itemize}

Note:  Earley parser uses top-down predictions to help disambiguate
part-of-speech ambiguities.  Only those parts-of-speech of a word
that are predicted by some state will find their way into the chart.

  \frametitle{Examples: Left Recursion}


What about parsing the \NP \ling{a flight from Denver to Boston}
with the following rules:
\begin{quote}
  \NP\ $\rightarrow$ \NP\ \PP

  \NP\ $\rightarrow$ \Det\ \Nom

  \NP\ $\rightarrow$ Proper-Noun

\end{quote}

\begin{itemize}
  \item We construct the state (\NP\ $\rightarrow$ \bigdot\ \NP\ \PP,
    [0,0]) and add it to \textit{chart}[0]
  \item The \textsc{Predictor} function then requires us to find a rule
    which expands the (non-lexical) category immediately to the right of
    the dot. 
  \item So let's pick the first rule above, and \textsc{Enqueue} the
    state (\NP\ $\rightarrow$ \bigdot\ \NP\ \PP, [0,0]).
  \item But this is already in the state, so we don't add it again. 
\end{itemize}

%  \begin{itemize}
    

%  \item What happens when we look at the contents of the last table
%    column and don't find a \Se\ $\rightarrow \alpha \, \bigdot$ rule?
%  \item Is  there some way to proceed?
%  \item Yes. The chart contains every constituent and combination of
%    constituents that could have been found for that input given the
%    grammar.
%  \item Useful for partial (or shallow) parsing, also called
%    \ling{chunking}, which is frequently used in information extraction
%    and question answering.

%  \frametitle{Alternative Control Strategies}


%Its trivial to take the Earley top-down strategy and change it to
%bottom-up or \ldots

%\ldots to change it to a best-first (A*) strategy based on the
%probabilities of the constituents. Simply compute and store the
%probabilities of constituents in the chart as you are parsing. Then
%instead of expanding the columns/states in a fixed order you allow the
%probabilities to control the order of expansion.

  \frametitle{Memoization and Dynamic Programming}

  
\item As we've seen, dynamic programming techniques make explicit use of
tables to keep track of solutions to previously encountered problems.

\item Correspondingly, dynamic programming algorithms are oriented around
systematically \Em{filling} these tables.

\item Memoization is an alternative technique that achieves the same
results but allows the algorithm
