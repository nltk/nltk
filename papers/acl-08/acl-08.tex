This paper describes the design of NLTK, and  reports on how it has been used effectively in classes that involve  a combination of linguists and computer scientists.\end{abstract}\section{Introduction}Natural Language Processing (NLP) is often taught within the confinesof a single-semester course at advanced undergraduate level orpostgraduate level. Many instructors have found that it is difficultto cover both the theoretical and practical sides of the subject insuch a short span of time, especially when some of the students havelimited programming experience. Some courses focus on theory to theexclusion of practical exercises, and deprive students of thechallenge and excitement of writing programs to automatically processlanguage. Other courses are simply designed to teach programming forlinguists, and do not manage to cover any significant NLP content. TheNatural Language Toolkit (NLTK) was originally developed to addressthis problem, making it feasible to cover a substantial amount oftheory and practice within a single-semester course, for an audienceconsisting of both linguists and computer scientists.The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is a suite of Python modulesdistributed under the GPL open source license from \url{nltk.org}.NLTK comes with a large collection of corpora and a free online bookcontaining hundreds of exercises.  It has been used in over 50university courses in over 15 countries.\footnote{\url{http://nltk.org/courses.html}}We believe NLTK is unique in providing a comprehensive frameworkfor students to learn about NLP in the context of learning toprogram. What sets it apart is the tight coupling of thechapters and exercises with NLTK, giving students -- even those with noprior programming experience -- a practical introduction to NLP. Oncecompleting these materials, students are ready to attempt one ofthe more advanced textbooks.Overview of paper: ...\section{Design Decisions Affecting Teaching}\subsection{Python}We chose Python because it has a shallow learning curve, its syntaxand semantics are transparent, and it has good string-handlingfunctionality.  As an interpreted language, Python facilitatesinteractive exploration.  As an object-oriented language, Pythonpermits data and methods to be encapsulated and re-used easily.  Python comes with an extensivestandard library, including tools for graphical programming andnumerical processing.help function, access to NLTK documentation on any module.Python itself fosters aninteractive style of teaching.  For instance, we've found it quitenatural to build up moderately complex programs in front of a class,with the weaker students transcribing it into a Python session ontheir laptop to satisfy themselves it works (but not necessarilyunderstanding everything they enter first time), while the strongerstudents quickly grasp the theoretical concepts and algorithms.  Whileboth groups can be served by the same presentation, they tend to askquite different questions.  However, this is addressed by dividingthem into smaller clusters and having TAs visit them separately todiscuss issues arising from the content.\subsection{Coding Requirements}Consistency, extensibility, simplicity, modularity.Non-requirements: comprehensiveness, efficiency, cleverness.\cite{LoperBird02}Code is readable -- a student who doesn't understand the maths of HMMs,smoothing, etc can get another angle on it via the code.\subsection{Corpus Access}Uniform corpus access.  After importing NLTK, one can access all the corporausing the \texttt{nltk.corpus} module:{\small\begin{verbatim}>>> nltk.corpus.NAME.METHOD(PARAMETERS)\end{verbatim}}Here, \texttt{NAME} is any of the 45 corpora distributed with NLTK, includingparsed, POS-tagged, plain text, categorized text, and lexicons.\footnote{\url{http://nltk.org/corpora.html}}The \texttt{METHOD} can be any of\texttt{raw}, for the raw contents of the corpus;\texttt{words}, for a list of tokenized words;\texttt{sents}, for the same list grouped into sentences;\texttt{tagged\_words}, for a list of (word,tag) pairs;\texttt{tagged\_sents}, for the same list grouped into sentences;\texttt{parsed\_sents}, for a list of parse trees.The following example shows how to access the Brown Corpus:{\small\begin{verbatim}>>> nltk.corpus.brown.tagged_words()[('The', 'at'), ('Fulton', 'np-tl'),('County', 'nn-tl'), ('Grand', 'jj-tl'),('Jury', 'nn-tl'), ('said', 'vbd'), ...]\end{verbatim}}Note that not all methods are available for all corpora (e.g. we canask for the words from just about any corpus, but only for\texttt{parsed\_sents} from the parsed corpora).The \texttt{PARAMETERS} are typically used to restrict the amount of material returned,e.g. to a section of a corpus, or an individual corpus file.\subsection{Diversity of Programming Experience}Self-paced learning: tutorials, hundreds of graded exercises (self-evaluation)NLTK supports assignments of varying difficulty and scope. In thesimplest assignments, students experiment with existing components toperform a wide variety of NLP tasks. This may involve no programmingat all, in the case of the existing demonstrations, or simply changinga line or two of program code. As students become more familiar withthe toolkit they can be asked to modify existing components or tocreate complete systems out of existing components. NLTK also providesstudents with a flexible framework for advanced projects, such asdeveloping a multi-component system, by integrating and extending NLTKcomponents, and adding on entirely new components. Here NLTK helps byproviding standard implementations of all the basic data structuresand algorithms, interfaces to standard corpora, substantial corpussamples, and a flexible and extensible architecture.\section{Getting Started}\subsection{The First Lecture}Motivating and exemplifying NLP to a mixed audiencethe holy grail: machines that understand language:- relates to linguists as - relates to CS students: technologies that demonstrate some level of NLU:  SLDS, QA, Summarization, MTdrivers: large data- web- corpora- no end to corpus formats, incompatible tools (linguists)  exploratory data analysis (find patterns not supported by existing software)- algorithms\subsection{CDROM}ISO image -- give out CDs\section{Classroom Interaction}\subsection{Demonstrations with the Python Interpreter}try it and seeNLTK book has many examples...An effective way to deliver the materials is through interactivepresentation of the examples, entering them at the Python prompt,observing what they do, and modifying them to explore some empiricalor theoretical question.\subsection{Interactive Demonstrations}A significant fraction of any NLP syllabus covers fundamental datastructures and algorithms. These are usually taught with the help offormal notations and complex diagrams. Large trees and charts arecopied onto the board and edited in tedious slow motion, orlaboriously prepared for presentation slides. It is more effective touse live demonstrations in which those diagrams are generated andupdated automatically. NLTK provides interactive graphical userinterfaces, making it possible to view program state and to studyprogram execution step-by-step. Most NLTK components have ademonstration mode, and will perform an interesting task withoutrequiring any special input from the user. It is even possible to makeminor modifications to programs in response to ``what if'' questions. Inthis way, students learn the mechanics of NLP quickly, gain deeperinsights into the data structures and algorithms, and acquire newproblem-solving skills.\subsection{Small Group Discussion}animate this with a quiz, presented as a slide or a handout, giving code samples and asking what they do.\section{Project Work}Group projects involving a mixture of linguists and CS students:initial appeal is that a CS student will help the linguist student with programming,and vice versa.  However, there's acomplex dynamic, unpredictable success, linguist probably won't get to programin the interests of a good project mark.Multi-stage project mandating stages that require linguistic and CS content: difficultto foster continuous collaboration, more likely to get e.g. parser being developed bya CS team member, then thrown over the wall to a linguist member to develop a grammar.Instead, believe it is more productive in the context of a single-semester introductorycourse to have students work on their own projects.  Devise distinct projects forstudents depending on background.  Provide a list and give them the option of proposingother projects.\url{http://nltk.org/projects.html}Peer review (including code review) to improve quality of programming, andemphasize the communicative dimension of programming.(Even grade a student on the quality of his/her peer review of another student.)\bibliographystyle{acl}\bibliography{acl-08}\end{document}
