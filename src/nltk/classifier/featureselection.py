"""
Classes and interfaces used to select which features are relevant for
a given classification task.

  - C{FeatureSelectorI} defines a standard interface for selecting
    which features from a given C{FeatureDetectorList} are relevant to
    a classification problem.

  - C{SelectedFDList} provides feature selectors with a convenient
    means of building C{FeatureDetectorList}s containing the feature
    detectors for the relevant features.

This module also defines classes implementing the C{FeatureSelectorI}
interface.

@warning: We plan to significantly refactor the nltk.classifier
    package for the next release of nltk.
