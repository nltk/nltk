# Open questions:
#     Should "tree" and "treetoken" be "ttree" and "ttreetoken" or
#       "treettoken" or even "ttreettoken"? :)
#     Should TreeToken.nodes() return a Tree or a TreeToken?

# To do:
#   - How should we handle traces and/or movement?

"""
Classes for representing hierarchical structures over text.  These
structures are called X{text-tree type}s, and individual occurances of
text-tree types are known as X{text-tree tokens}.  Note that several
different text-tree tokens might all have the same text-tree type.
For example, if the sentence \"the dog chased the cat\" occurs three
times in a document, each occurance of the sentence will have a
different text-tree token; but all three text-tree tokens will have
the same text-tree type.  The term X{text-tree} (or X{tree} for short)
can be used to refer to both text-tree types and text-tree tokens.

The tree module defines the C{Tree} class to represent text-tree
types, and the C{TreeToken} class to represent text-tree tokens.
C{TreeToken} is a subclass of C{Token}; thus, C{TreeToken}s have
locations, which can be used to distinguish different C{TreeToken}s
with the same text-tree type.  C{Tree}s and C{TreeToken}s are both
children of the abstract class C{AbstractTree}, which defines many
procedures that the two classes have in common.  See the documentation
for the C{Tree} and C{TreeToken} classes for more information on how
text-tree types and tokens are represented.

Text-tree types can be constructed from strings using any one of a
number of X{parsing functions}.  These function differ in that they
read different formats; and they produce text-tree types with
different kinds of nodes and leaves.  Currently, the following parsing 
functions are defined:

    - C{parse_treebank()}: Parses treebank-style syntax trees.

class Tree(AbstractTree):
    """
    A homogenous hierarchical structure spanning text types.  A
    C{Tree} consists of a X{node value} and zero or more X{children}.

    The node value associates information with the entire C{Tree}.
    For example, node values might be used to label syntactic
    constituents with phrase tags, such as \"NP\" and\"VP\".

    The children encode the hierarchical contents of the C{Tree}.
    Each child is either a X{leaf} or a X{subtree}.  Leaves are the
    text types over which the C{Tree} is defined.  Subtrees are
    C{Tree} objects that are used to encode the structure of the
    C{Tree}.

    A tree's children can be accessed using the indexing operator:

        >>> tree = Tree('S', Tree('NP', 'the', 'cat'),
        ...                  Tree('VP', 'ate'))
        >>> tree[0]
        ('NP': 'the', 'cat')
        >>> tree[1][0]
        'ate'

    A tree's children can be iterated over using C{for} expressions:

        >>> for child in tree:
        ...     print child
        ('NP': 'the', 'cat')
        ('VP': 'ate')

    A tree's descendants can be accessed using tree positions.  A
    X{tree position} is a tuple of child indices specifying the path
    from a tree's root to one of its descendants.  In particular, the
    tree position C{()} specifies the root of a tree; and if C{M{p}}
    is the tree position of descendant M{d}, then C{M{p}+(M{i})}
    specifies the C{M{i}}th child of M{d}.  Tree positions may be used
    with the indexing operator to access a tree or its descendants:

        >>> tree[1, 0]
        'ate'
        >>> pos = (0, 1)
        >>> tree[pos]
        'cat'

        >>> treetok = TreeToken('S', TreeToken('NP', words[0], words[1]),
        ...                          TreeToken('VP', words[2]))

        >>> treetok[1][0]

    A tree's children can be iterated over using C{for} expressions:

        >>> for child in treetok:
        ...     print child
        ('NP': 'the' 'cat')@[0w:2w]
        ('VP': 'ate')@[2w]

    A tree's descendants can be accessed using tree positions.  A
    X{tree position} is a tuple of child indices specifying the path
    from a tree's root to one of its descendants.  In particular, the
    tree position C{()} specifies the root of a tree; and if C{M{p}}
    is the tree position of descendant M{d}, then C{M{p}+(M{i})}
    specifies the C{M{i}}th child of M{d}.  Tree positions may be used
    with the indexing operator:

        >>> treetok[1, 0]
        'ate'@[2w]
        >>> pos = (0, 1)
        >>> treetok[pos]
        'cat'@[1w]
        >>> treetok[()]
        ('S': ('NP': 'the', 'cat'), ('VP': 'ate'))@[0w:3w]

    Type Checking
    =============
    A C{TreeToken}'s X{leaf set} consists of the leaf children of the
    C{TreeToken} and the leaf sets of its subtrees.  All leaves in a tree's
    leaf set must have text types with the same pytype.  A C{TreeToken}'s
    X{node value set} consists of the node value of the C{TreeToken} and
    the node value sets of its subtrees.  All node values in a tree's
    node value set must have the same pytype.

    @ivar _nodetype: The pytype of this C{TreeToken}'s nodes.  (Used to 
        enforce consistancy conditions).
    @type _nodetype: C{type} or C{class}
    @ivar _leaftype: The pytype of this C{TreeToken}'s leaves' types.
        (Used to enforce consistancy conditions).
