# Open questions:
#     Should "tree" and "treetoken" be "ttree" and "ttreetoken" or
#       "treettoken" or even "ttreettoken"? :)
#     Should TreeToken.nodes() return a Tree or a TreeToken?

# To do:
#   - add x-to-y methods for treebank, etc.
#   - traces!! Whee.

Classes for representing text-trees.  A X{text-tree type} is a
hierarchical data structures over a text, such as syntax tree.
Individual occurances of text-tree types are known as X{text-tree
tokens}.  Note that several different text-tree tokens might all have
the same text-tree type.  For example, if the sentence \"the dog
chased the cat\" occurs three times in a document, each occurance of
the sentence will have a different text-tree token; but all three
text-tree tokens will have the same text-tree type.

The tree module defines the C{Tree} class to represent text-tree
types, and the C{TreeToken} class to represent text-tree tokens.
C{TreeToken} is a subclass of C{Token}; thus, C{TreeToken}s have
locations, which can be used to distinguish different C{TreeToken}s
with the same text-tree type.  See the documentation for the C{Tree}
and C{TreeToken} classes for more information on how text-tree types
and tokens are represented.

Text-tree types can be constructed from strings using any one of a
number of X{parsing functions}.  These function differ in that they
read different formats; and they produce text-tree types with
different kinds of nodes and leaves.  Currently, the following parsing 
functions are defined:

    - C{parse_treebank()}: Parses treebank-style syntax trees.
