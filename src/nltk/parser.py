"""
Interface for producing tree structures that represent the internal
organziation of a text.  This task is known as X{parsing} the text,
and the resulting tree structures are called the text's X{parses}.
Typically, the text is a single sentence, and the tree structure
represents the syntactic structure of the sentence.  However, parsers
can also be used in other domains.  For example, parsers could be used
to derive the morphological structure of the morphemes that make up a
word, or to derive the discourse structure of a list of utterances.

Sometimes, a single piece of text can be represented by more than one
tree structure.  Texts represented by more than one tree structure are
called X{ambiguous} texts.  Note that there are actually two ways in
which a text can be ambiguous:

    - The text has multiple correct parses.
    - There is not enough information to decide which of several
      candidate parses is correct.

However, the parser module does I{not} distinguish these two types of
ambiguity.

    A processing interface for deriving tree structures that represent
    an ordered list of tokens.  Typically, these tree structures will
    indicate the syntactic structure of sentences.

    Parsing a text will generate zero or more tree structures, known
    as parses.  Abstractly, each of these parses has a X{quality}
    associated with it.  Usually, a parse's quality represents the
    probability that it is a correct parse; however, the exact
    definition of quality is left to individual parsers.  These
    quality ratings are used to decide which parses to return.  In
    particular, the methods C{parse()} and C{parseTypes()} can both
    return lists of the M{n} best parses, sorted in descending order
    of quality.

class ParserI2:
    """
    A processing interface for deriving trees that represent possible
    structures for a sequence of tokens.  These tree structures are
    known as X{parses}.  Typically, parsers are used to derive syntax
    trees for sentences.  But parsers can also be used to derive other
    kinds of tree structure, such as morphological trees and discourse
    structures.

    A parse for a text assigns a tree structure to that text, but does
    not modify the text itself.  In particular, if M{t} is a text,
    then the leaves of any parse of M{t} should be M{t}.

    Parsing a text generates zero or more parses.  Abstractly, each of
    these parses has a X{quality} associated with it.  These quality
    ratings are used to decide which parses to return.  In particular,
    the C{parse} method returns the parse with the highest quality;
    and the C{parse_n} method returns a list of parses, sorted by
    their quality.

    If multiple parses have the same quality, then C{parse} and
    C{parse_n} can choose between them arbitrarily.  In particular,
    for some parsers, all parses have the same quality.  For these
    parsers, C{parse} returns a single arbitrary parse, and C{parse_n}
    returns an list of parses in arbitrary order.
