##  Sample
##//////////////////////////////////////////////////////
  
# A sample can be any Python object that is not an Event.  Typical
# examples are tokens, lists of tokens, sets of tokens.  Samples can't be 
# Functions, either.
# Every sample must define == correctly (and __hash__)

class EventI:
    """
    A subset of the samples that compose some sample space.  Note that 
    this subset need not be finite.  Events are typically written as
    the set of samples they contain, or as a function in first order
    logic.  Examples are::
      {1,2,3}
      {x:x>0}

    The only method that events are required to implement is
    C{__contains__()}, which tests whether a sample is a
    contained by the event.  However, when possible, events should
    also define the following methods:
        - C{__cmp__()}, which tests whether this event is
           equal to another event.
        - C{subset()}, which tests whether this event is a
           subset of another event.
        - C{superset()}, which tests whether this event is
           a superset of another event.
        - C{union()}, which returns an event containing the
           union of this event's samples and another event's samples.
        - C{intersection()}, which returns an event
           containing the intersection of this event's samples and
           another event's samples.
        - C{samples()}, which returns a C{Set}
           containing all of the samples that are contained by this
           event. 
        - C{__len__()}, which returns the number of samples 
           contained by this event.
    
    Classes implementing the C{EventI} interface may choose
    to only support certain classes of samples, or may choose to only
    support certain types of events as arguments to the optional
    methods (C{__cmp__}, C{subset}, etc.).  If a
    method is unable to return a correct result because it is given an 
    unsupported type of sample or event, it should raise a
    NotImplementedError.  (?? is this the right exception? use
    NotSupportedError? ValueError? ??)

    A frequency distribution for the outcomes of an experiment.  A
    frequency distribution records the number of times each outcome of
    an experiment has occured.  For example, a frequency distribution

    Formally, a frequency distribution can be defined as a function
    mapping from samples to the number of times that sample occured as
    an outcome.

    Frequency distributions are generally constructed by running a
    number of experiments, and incrementing the count for a sample
    every time it is an outcome of an experiment.  For example, the
    following code will produce a frequency distribution that encodes
    how often each word occurs in a text::

        Find the conditional probability of the specified sample or
        event, given the specified condition.  The conditional
        probability is defined as the probability that a sample will
        be in C{sample_or_event}, given the information that
        the sample is in C{condition}.  Assuming the
        condition event defines the C{union} member, then
        this definition can be written as::

          fd.cond_prob(e, c) == fd.prob(c.union(e)) / fd.prob(c)

        As a special case, if all samples in the given condition have
        probability 0, the conditional probability is defined as
        C{None}.  Conditional probabilities are always
        either real numbers in the range [0, 1] or the special value
        C{None}.
