"""
Classes for representing and processing probabilistic information.

The L{FreqDist} class is used to encode X{frequency distributions},
which count the number of times that each outcome of an experiment
occurs.

The L{ProbDistI} class defines a standard interface for X{probability
distributions}, which encode the probability of each outcome for an
experiment.  There are two types of probability distribution:

  - X{derived probability distributions} are created from frequency
    distributions.  They attempt to model the probability distribution
    that generated the frequency distribution.
  - X{analytic probability distributions} are created directly from
    parameters (such as variance).

The L{ConditionalFreqDist} class and L{ConditionalProbDistI} interface
are used to encode conditional distributions.  Conditional probability
distributions can be derived or analytic; but currently the only
implementation of the C{CondtionalProbDistI} interface is
L{ConditionalProbDist}, a derived distribution.

The L{ProbabilisticMixIn} class is a mix-in class that can be used to
associate probabilities with data classes (such as C{Token} or
C{Tree}).

    A frequency distribution for the outcomes of an experiment.  A
    frequency distribution records the number of times each outcome of
    an experiment has occured.  For example, a frequency distribution
    could be used to record the frequency of each word type in a
    document.  Formally, a frequency distribution can be defined as a
    function mapping from each sample to the number of times that
    sample occured as an outcome.

    Frequency distributions are generally constructed by running a
    number of experiments, and incrementing the count for a sample
    every time it is an outcome of an experiment.  For example, the
    following code will produce a frequency distribution that encodes
    how often each word occurs in a text:

    When the indexing operator is used to access the frequency
    distribution for a condition that has not been accessed before,
    C{ConditionalFreqDist} creates a new empty C{FreqDist} for that
    condition.

    Conditional frequency distributions are typically constructed by
    repeatedly running an experiment under a variety of conditions,
    and incrementing the sample outcome counts for the appropriate
    conditions.  For example, the following code will produce a
    conditional frequency distribution that encodes how often each
    word type occurs, given the length of that word type:
