# Open questions:
#    Should "type" and "token" be replaced with "ttype" and "ttoken"?
#    Should representations be modified?
#    What should comparisons do when given bad types??? e.g., != with
#        None? 

# To do:
#    - unit testing
#    - Am I happy with current str/repr???

"""
Basic classes useful for processing individual elements of text, such
as words or sentences.  These elements of text are known as X{text
types}, or X{types} for short.  Individual occurances of types are
known as X{text tokens}, or X{tokens} for short.  Note that several
different tokens may have the same type.  For example, multiple
occurances of the same word in a text will constitute multiple tokens,
but only one type.  Tokens are distinguished based on their
X{location} within the source text.

The token module defines the C{Token} class to represent tokens, and
the C{Location} class to represent their locations.  The token module
does not define a single class or interface for representing text
types.  Instead, text types may be represented by any immutable
object.  Typically, elements of text will be represented with strings.
In addition, the token module defines several simple classes that can
be used as text types.  Currently, the following classes are defined:

    - C{TaggedType}: A type consisting of a base type and a tag.  For
      example, this class could be used to represent part-of-speech
      tagged words.

In addition, the token module defines the C{TokenizerI} interface, as
well as several implementations of that interface.  A X{tokenizer} is
a class which converts a string of text into its constituant tokens.
Different tokenizers may split the text up differently.

class Location:
    """
    A span over indices in a text.

    The text over which the location is defined is identified by the
    C{Location}'s X{source}.  A typical value for a C{Location}'s
    source would be the name of the file containing the text.  The
    unit of the indices in the text is specified by the C{Location}'s
    X{unit}.  Typical units are \"word\" and \"character\".  A
    C{Location}'s source and unit fields are optional; if not
    specified, they will default to C{None}.

    The span itself is represented with by the C{Location}'s X{start
    index} and X{end index}.  A C{Location} identifies the text
    beginning at its start index, and including everything up to (but
    not including) the text at its end index.

    A location with a start index of 5 and an end index of 10, a
    source of 'example.txt', and a unit of 'word' can be written as::

    and a X{location}.  The type is the unit of text (e.g., a specific
    word).  The location is the position at which this token occured
    in the original text.

    The precise defintion of what counts as a type will vary for

    types.  Notable invalid types are lists and dictionaries.  Note
    that string text types are case sensitive.
