"""
Classes and interfaces for producing tree structures that represent
the internal organziation of a text.  This task is known as X{parsing}
the text, and the resulting tree structures are called the text's
X{parses}.  Typically, the text is a single sentence, and the tree
structure represents the syntactic structure of the sentence.
However, parsers can also be used in other domains.  For example,
parsers could be used to derive the morphological structure of the
morphemes that make up a word, or to derive the discourse structure of
a list of utterances.

Sometimes, a single piece of text can be represented by more than one
tree structure.  Texts represented by more than one tree structure are
called X{ambiguous} texts.  Note that there are actually two ways in
which a text can be ambiguous:

    - The text has multiple correct parses.
    - There is not enough information to decide which of several
      candidate parses is correct.

However, the parser module does I{not} distinguish these two types of
ambiguity.

##  Parser Interface

class ParserI:
    """
    A processing interface for deriving trees that represent possible
    structures for a sequence of tokens.  These tree structures are
    known as X{parses}.  Typically, parsers are used to derive syntax
    trees for sentences.  But parsers can also be used to derive other
    kinds of tree structure, such as morphological trees and discourse
    structures.

    A parse for a text assigns a tree structure to that text, but does
    not modify the text itself.  In particular, if M{t} is a text,
    then the leaves of any parse of M{t} should be M{t}.

    Parsing a text generates zero or more parses.  Abstractly, each of
    these parses has a X{quality} associated with it.  These quality
    ratings are used to decide which parses to return.  In particular,
    the C{parse} method returns the parse with the highest quality;
    and the C{parse_n} method returns a list of parses, sorted by
    their quality.

    If multiple parses have the same quality, then C{parse} and
    C{parse_n} can choose between them arbitrarily.  In particular,
    for some parsers, all parses have the same quality.  For these
    parsers, C{parse} returns a single arbitrary parse, and C{parse_n}
    returns an list of parses in arbitrary order.
