"""
Basic data classes for representing context free grammars.  A
X{grammar} specifies which trees can represent the structure of a
given text.  Each of these trees is called a X{parse tree} for the
text (or simply a X{parse}).  In a X{context free} grammar, the set of
parse trees for any piece of a text can depend only on that piece, and
not on the rest of the text (i.e., the piece's context).  Context free
grammars are often used to find possible syntactic structures for
sentences.  In this context, the leaves of a parse tree are word
tokens; and the node values are phrasal categories, such as C{"NP"}
and C{"VP"}.

The C{CFG} class is used to encode context free grammars.  Each C{CFG}
consists of a start symbol and a set of rules.  The X{start symbol}
specifies the root node value for parse trees.  For example, the start
symbol for syntactic parsing is usually C{"S"}.  Start symbols are
encoded using the C{Nonterminal} class, which is discussed below.

A CFG's X{rules} specify what parent-child relationships a parse tree
can contain.  Each rule specifies that a particular node can be the
parent of a particular set of children.  For example, the rule C{"<S>
-> <NP> <VP>"} specifies that an C{"S"} node can be the parent of an
C{"NP"} node and a C{"VP"} node.

CFG rules are implemented by the C{CFG_Rule} class.  Each C{CFG_Rule}
consists of a left hand side and a right hand side.  The X{left hand
side} is a C{Nonterminal} that specifies the node type for a potential
parent; and the X{right hand side} is a list that specifies allowable
children for that parent.  This lists consists of C{Nonterminals} and
text tokens: each C{Nonterminal} indicates that the corresponding
child may be a C{TreeToken} with the specified node type; and each
text type indicates that the corresponding child may be a C{Token}
with the with that type.

The C{Nonterminal} class is used to distinguish node values from leaf
values.  This prevents the grammar from accidentally using a leaf
value (such as the English word "A") as the node of a subtree.  Within
a C{CFG}, all node values are wrapped in the C{Nonterminal} class.
Note, however, that the trees that are specified by the grammar do
B{not} include these C{Nonterminal} wrappers.

CFGs can also be given a more procedural interpretation.  According to
this interpretation, a CFG specifies any tree structure M{tree} that
can be produced by the following procedure:

    - Set M{tree} to the start symbol
    - Repeat until M{tree} contains no more nonterminals:
      - Choose a rule M{rule} with whose left hand side M{lhs} is a
        nonterminal in M{tree}.
      - Replace one occurance of M{lhs} with a subtree, whose node
        value is the value wrapped by the nonterminal M{lhs}, and
        whose children are the right hand side of M{rule}.

The operation of replacing the left hand side (M{lhs}) of a rule with
the right hand side (M{rhs}) in a tree (M{tree}) is known as
X{expanding} M{lhs} to M{rhs} in M{tree}.

String Representaitons
======================
A C{CFG_Rule} whose left hand side is C{M{lhs}} and whose right hand
side is C{M{rhs}} is written "C{M{lhs}->M{rhs}}".  A C{Nonterminal}
with symbol M{s} is written "C{<M{s}>}" Thus, for example, the
C{CFG_Rule} that specifies that a tree with node value C{"NP"} can
have children that are subtrees with node values C{"Det"} and C{"N"}
is written::

    NP -> Det N

And the rule that specifies that a tree with node value C{"N"} can
have a leaf with text type C{"dog"} is::

    N -> 'dog'
